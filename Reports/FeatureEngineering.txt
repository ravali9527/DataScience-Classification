Feature Engineering :
Feature Engineering is the process of extracting or creating new features that would help to gain better performance 


Given Data set:
This is a dataset comprised of all of Shakespeare's plays. It includes the following:

The first column is the Data-Line, it just keeps track of all the rows there are.
The second column is the play that the lines are from.
The third column is the actual line being spoken at any given time.
The fourth column is the Act-Scene-Line from which any given line is from.
The fifth column is the player who is saying any given line.
The sixth column is the line being spoken.


Features that can be added to existing data sets:

If we can add certain features like frequency of voice and gender, combination of these two features can be used to determine the player.

Feature Selection:

I used Weka tool for feature selection.

Steps:
Loading csv file and selecting Correlation ranking method for attribute selection using breadth first search so It ranked the features based on that approach 

Play,Player Line are ranked as the best attributes for determining player

Steps 
Deleted rows which contains empty cells
Converted object types to numeric values using label encoding scheme 
Divided data into test_predictors,Train_predictors, Test_Targets,train_targets
Trained model using train predictors train targets
Making the model predict given test targets
Computing Accuracy score
Prediction Accuract from the model 0.05938852170605297
