Given Data set:
This is a dataset comprised of all of Shakespeare's plays. It includes the following:

The first column is the Data-Line, it just keeps track of all the rows there are.
The second column is the play that the lines are from.
The third column is the actual line being spoken at any given time.
The fourth column is the Act-Scene-Line from which any given line is from.
The fifth column is the player who is saying any given line.
The sixth column is the line being spoken.


Features that can be added to existing data sets:

If we can add certain features like frequency of voice and gender,combination of these two features can be used to determine the player.
