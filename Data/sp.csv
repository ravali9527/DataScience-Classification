1,Henry IV,,,,
2,Henry IV,,,,SCENE I. London. The palace.
3,Henry IV,,,,"Enter KING HENRY, LORD JOHN OF LANCASTER, the EARL of WESTMORELAND, SIR WALTER BLUNT, and others"
4,Henry IV,1,1.1.1,KING HENRY IV,"So shaken as we are, so wan with care,"
5,Henry IV,1,1.1.2,KING HENRY IV,"Find we a time for frighted peace to pant,"
6,Henry IV,1,1.1.3,KING HENRY IV,And breathe short-winded accents of new broils
7,Henry IV,1,1.1.4,KING HENRY IV,To be commenced in strands afar remote.
8,Henry IV,1,1.1.5,KING HENRY IV,No more the thirsty entrance of this soil
9,Henry IV,1,1.1.6,KING HENRY IV,"Shall daub her lips with her own children's blood,"
10,Henry IV,1,1.1.7,KING HENRY IV,"Nor more shall trenching war channel her fields,"
11,Henry IV,1,1.1.8,KING HENRY IV,Nor bruise her flowerets with the armed hoofs
12,Henry IV,1,1.1.9,KING HENRY IV,"Of hostile paces: those opposed eyes,"
13,Henry IV,1,1.1.10,KING HENRY IV,"Which, like the meteors of a troubled heaven,"
14,Henry IV,1,1.1.11,KING HENRY IV,"All of one nature, of one substance bred,"
15,Henry IV,1,1.1.12,KING HENRY IV,Did lately meet in the intestine shock
16,Henry IV,1,1.1.13,KING HENRY IV,And furious close of civil butchery
17,Henry IV,1,1.1.14,KING HENRY IV,"Shall now, in mutual well-beseeming ranks,"
18,Henry IV,1,1.1.15,KING HENRY IV,March all one way and be no more opposed
19,Henry IV,1,1.1.16,KING HENRY IV,"Against acquaintance, kindred and allies:"
20,Henry IV,1,1.1.17,KING HENRY IV,"The edge of war, like an ill-sheathed knife,"
21,Henry IV,1,1.1.18,KING HENRY IV,"No more shall cut his master. Therefore, friends,"
22,Henry IV,1,1.1.19,KING HENRY IV,"As far as to the sepulchre of Christ,"
23,Henry IV,1,1.1.20,KING HENRY IV,"Whose soldier now, under whose blessed cross"
24,Henry IV,1,1.1.21,KING HENRY IV,"We are impressed and engaged to fight,"
25,Henry IV,1,1.1.22,KING HENRY IV,"Forthwith a power of English shall we levy,"
26,Henry IV,1,1.1.23,KING HENRY IV,Whose arms were moulded in their mothers' womb
27,Henry IV,1,1.1.24,KING HENRY IV,To chase these pagans in those holy fields
28,Henry IV,1,1.1.25,KING HENRY IV,Over whose acres walk'd those blessed feet
29,Henry IV,1,1.1.26,KING HENRY IV,Which fourteen hundred years ago were nail'd
30,Henry IV,1,1.1.27,KING HENRY IV,For our advantage on the bitter cross.
31,Henry IV,1,1.1.28,KING HENRY IV,"But this our purpose now is twelve month old,"
32,Henry IV,1,1.1.29,KING HENRY IV,And bootless 'tis to tell you we will go:
33,Henry IV,1,1.1.30,KING HENRY IV,Therefore we meet not now. Then let me hear
34,Henry IV,1,1.1.31,KING HENRY IV,"Of you, my gentle cousin Westmoreland,"
35,Henry IV,1,1.1.32,KING HENRY IV,What yesternight our council did decree
36,Henry IV,1,1.1.33,KING HENRY IV,In forwarding this dear expedience.
37,Henry IV,2,1.1.34,WESTMORELAND,"My liege, this haste was hot in question,"
38,Henry IV,2,1.1.35,WESTMORELAND,And many limits of the charge set down
39,Henry IV,2,1.1.36,WESTMORELAND,But yesternight: when all athwart there came
40,Henry IV,2,1.1.37,WESTMORELAND,"A post from Wales loaden with heavy news,"
41,Henry IV,2,1.1.38,WESTMORELAND,"Whose worst was, that the noble Mortimer,"
42,Henry IV,2,1.1.39,WESTMORELAND,Leading the men of Herefordshire to fight
43,Henry IV,2,1.1.40,WESTMORELAND,"Against the irregular and wild Glendower,"
44,Henry IV,2,1.1.41,WESTMORELAND,"Was by the rude hands of that Welshman taken,"
45,Henry IV,2,1.1.42,WESTMORELAND,"A thousand of his people butchered,"
46,Henry IV,2,1.1.43,WESTMORELAND,"Upon whose dead corpse there was such misuse,"
47,Henry IV,2,1.1.44,WESTMORELAND,"Such beastly shameless transformation,"
48,Henry IV,2,1.1.45,WESTMORELAND,By those Welshwomen done as may not be
49,Henry IV,2,1.1.46,WESTMORELAND,Without much shame retold or spoken of.
50,Henry IV,3,1.1.47,KING HENRY IV,It seems then that the tidings of this broil
51,Henry IV,3,1.1.48,KING HENRY IV,Brake off our business for the Holy Land.
52,Henry IV,4,1.1.49,WESTMORELAND,"This match'd with other did, my gracious lord,"
53,Henry IV,4,1.1.50,WESTMORELAND,For more uneven and unwelcome news
54,Henry IV,4,1.1.51,WESTMORELAND,Came from the north and thus it did import:
55,Henry IV,4,1.1.52,WESTMORELAND,"On Holy-rood day, the gallant Hotspur there,"
56,Henry IV,4,1.1.53,WESTMORELAND,"Young Harry Percy and brave Archibald,"
57,Henry IV,4,1.1.54,WESTMORELAND,"That ever-valiant and approved Scot,"
58,Henry IV,4,1.1.55,WESTMORELAND,"At Holmedon met,"
59,Henry IV,4,1.1.56,WESTMORELAND,"Where they did spend a sad and bloody hour,"
60,Henry IV,4,1.1.57,WESTMORELAND,"As by discharge of their artillery,"
61,Henry IV,4,1.1.58,WESTMORELAND,"And shape of likelihood, the news was told,"
62,Henry IV,4,1.1.59,WESTMORELAND,"For he that brought them, in the very heat"
63,Henry IV,4,1.1.60,WESTMORELAND,"And pride of their contention did take horse,"
64,Henry IV,4,1.1.61,WESTMORELAND,Uncertain of the issue any way.
65,Henry IV,5,1.1.62,KING HENRY IV,"Here is a dear, a true industrious friend,"
66,Henry IV,5,1.1.63,KING HENRY IV,"Sir Walter Blunt, new lighted from his horse."
67,Henry IV,5,1.1.64,KING HENRY IV,Stain'd with the variation of each soil
68,Henry IV,5,1.1.65,KING HENRY IV,"Betwixt that Holmedon and this seat of ours,"
69,Henry IV,5,1.1.66,KING HENRY IV,And he hath brought us smooth and welcome news.
70,Henry IV,5,1.1.67,KING HENRY IV,The Earl of Douglas is discomfited:
71,Henry IV,5,1.1.68,KING HENRY IV,"Ten thousand bold Scots, two and twenty knights,"
72,Henry IV,5,1.1.69,KING HENRY IV,Balk'd in their own blood did Sir Walter see
73,Henry IV,5,1.1.70,KING HENRY IV,"On Holmedon's plains. Of prisoners, Hotspur took"
74,Henry IV,5,1.1.71,KING HENRY IV,"Mordake the Earl of Fife, and eldest son"
75,Henry IV,5,1.1.72,KING HENRY IV,"To beaten Douglas, and the Earl of Athol,"
76,Henry IV,5,1.1.73,KING HENRY IV,"Of Murray, Angus, and Menteith:"
77,Henry IV,5,1.1.74,KING HENRY IV,And is not this an honourable spoil?
78,Henry IV,5,1.1.75,KING HENRY IV,"A gallant prize? ha, cousin, is it not?"
79,Henry IV,6,1.1.76,WESTMORELAND,"In faith,"
80,Henry IV,6,1.1.77,WESTMORELAND,It is a conquest for a prince to boast of.
81,Henry IV,7,1.1.78,KING HENRY IV,"Yea, there thou makest me sad and makest me sin"
82,Henry IV,7,1.1.79,KING HENRY IV,In envy that my Lord Northumberland
83,Henry IV,7,1.1.80,KING HENRY IV,"Should be the father to so blest a son,"
84,Henry IV,7,1.1.81,KING HENRY IV,"A son who is the theme of honour's tongue,"
85,Henry IV,7,1.1.82,KING HENRY IV,"Amongst a grove, the very straightest plant,"
86,Henry IV,7,1.1.83,KING HENRY IV,Who is sweet Fortune's minion and her pride:
87,Henry IV,7,1.1.84,KING HENRY IV,"Whilst I, by looking on the praise of him,"
88,Henry IV,7,1.1.85,KING HENRY IV,See riot and dishonour stain the brow
89,Henry IV,7,1.1.86,KING HENRY IV,Of my young Harry. O that it could be proved
90,Henry IV,7,1.1.87,KING HENRY IV,That some night-tripping fairy had exchanged
91,Henry IV,7,1.1.88,KING HENRY IV,"In cradle-clothes our children where they lay,"
92,Henry IV,7,1.1.89,KING HENRY IV,"And call'd mine Percy, his Plantagenet!"
93,Henry IV,7,1.1.90,KING HENRY IV,"Then would I have his Harry, and he mine."
94,Henry IV,7,1.1.91,KING HENRY IV,"But let him from my thoughts. What think you, coz,"
95,Henry IV,7,1.1.92,KING HENRY IV,"Of this young Percy's pride? the prisoners,"
96,Henry IV,7,1.1.93,KING HENRY IV,"Which he in this adventure hath surprised,"
97,Henry IV,7,1.1.94,KING HENRY IV,"To his own use he keeps, and sends me word,"
98,Henry IV,7,1.1.95,KING HENRY IV,I shall have none but Mordake Earl of Fife.
99,Henry IV,8,1.1.96,WESTMORELAND,"This is his uncle's teaching, this is Worcester,"
100,Henry IV,8,1.1.97,WESTMORELAND,"Malevolent to you in all aspects,"
101,Henry IV,8,1.1.98,WESTMORELAND,"Which makes him prune himself, and bristle up"
102,Henry IV,8,1.1.99,WESTMORELAND,The crest of youth against your dignity.
103,Henry IV,9,1.1.100,KING HENRY IV,"But I have sent for him to answer this,"
104,Henry IV,9,1.1.101,KING HENRY IV,And for this cause awhile we must neglect
105,Henry IV,9,1.1.102,KING HENRY IV,Our holy purpose to Jerusalem.
106,Henry IV,9,1.1.103,KING HENRY IV,"Cousin, on Wednesday next our council we"
107,Henry IV,9,1.1.104,KING HENRY IV,"Will hold at Windsor, so inform the lords:"
108,Henry IV,9,1.1.105,KING HENRY IV,"But come yourself with speed to us again,"
109,Henry IV,9,1.1.106,KING HENRY IV,For more is to be said and to be done
110,Henry IV,9,1.1.107,KING HENRY IV,Than out of anger can be uttered.
111,Henry IV,10,1.1.108,WESTMORELAND,"I will, my liege."
112,Henry IV,10,,WESTMORELAND,Exeunt
113,Henry IV,10,,WESTMORELAND,SCENE II. London. An apartment of the Prince's.
114,Henry IV,10,,WESTMORELAND,Enter the PRINCE OF WALES and FALSTAFF
115,Henry IV,1,1.2.1,FALSTAFF,"Now, Hal, what time of day is it, lad?"
116,Henry IV,2,1.2.2,PRINCE HENRY,"Thou art so fat-witted, with drinking of old sack"
117,Henry IV,2,1.2.3,PRINCE HENRY,and unbuttoning thee after supper and sleeping upon
118,Henry IV,2,1.2.4,PRINCE HENRY,"benches after noon, that thou hast forgotten to"
119,Henry IV,2,1.2.5,PRINCE HENRY,demand that truly which thou wouldst truly know.
120,Henry IV,2,1.2.6,PRINCE HENRY,What a devil hast thou to do with the time of the
121,Henry IV,2,1.2.7,PRINCE HENRY,day? Unless hours were cups of sack and minutes
122,Henry IV,2,1.2.8,PRINCE HENRY,capons and clocks the tongues of bawds and dials the
123,Henry IV,2,1.2.9,PRINCE HENRY,signs of leaping-houses and the blessed sun himself
124,Henry IV,2,1.2.10,PRINCE HENRY,"a fair hot wench in flame-coloured taffeta, I see no"
125,Henry IV,2,1.2.11,PRINCE HENRY,reason why thou shouldst be so superfluous to demand
126,Henry IV,2,1.2.12,PRINCE HENRY,the time of the day.
127,Henry IV,3,1.2.13,FALSTAFF,"Indeed, you come near me now, Hal, for we that take"
128,Henry IV,3,1.2.14,FALSTAFF,"purses go by the moon and the seven stars, and not"
129,Henry IV,3,1.2.15,FALSTAFF,"by Phoebus, he,'that wandering knight so fair.' And,"
130,Henry IV,3,1.2.16,FALSTAFF,"I prithee, sweet wag, when thou art king, as, God"
131,Henry IV,3,1.2.17,FALSTAFF,"save thy grace,--majesty I should say, for grace"
132,Henry IV,3,1.2.18,FALSTAFF,"thou wilt have none,--"
133,Henry IV,4,1.2.19,PRINCE HENRY,"What, none?"
134,Henry IV,5,1.2.20,FALSTAFF,"No, by my troth, not so much as will serve to"
135,Henry IV,5,1.2.21,FALSTAFF,prologue to an egg and butter.
136,Henry IV,6,1.2.22,PRINCE HENRY,"Well, how then? come, roundly, roundly."
137,Henry IV,7,1.2.23,FALSTAFF,"Marry, then, sweet wag, when thou art king, let not"
138,Henry IV,7,1.2.24,FALSTAFF,us that are squires of the night's body be called
139,Henry IV,7,1.2.25,FALSTAFF,thieves of the day's beauty: let us be Diana's
140,Henry IV,7,1.2.26,FALSTAFF,"foresters, gentlemen of the shade, minions of the"
141,Henry IV,7,1.2.27,FALSTAFF,"moon, and let men say we be men of good government,"
142,Henry IV,7,1.2.28,FALSTAFF,"being governed, as the sea is, by our noble and"
143,Henry IV,7,1.2.29,FALSTAFF,"chaste mistress the moon, under whose countenance we steal."
144,Henry IV,8,1.2.30,PRINCE HENRY,"Thou sayest well, and it holds well too, for the"
145,Henry IV,8,1.2.31,PRINCE HENRY,fortune of us that are the moon's men doth ebb and
146,Henry IV,8,1.2.32,PRINCE HENRY,"flow like the sea, being governed, as the sea is,"
147,Henry IV,8,1.2.33,PRINCE HENRY,"by the moon. As, for proof, now: a purse of gold"
148,Henry IV,8,1.2.34,PRINCE HENRY,most resolutely snatched on Monday night and most
149,Henry IV,8,1.2.35,PRINCE HENRY,"dissolutely spent on Tuesday morning, got with"
150,Henry IV,8,1.2.36,PRINCE HENRY,"swearing 'Lay by' and spent with crying 'Bring in,'"
151,Henry IV,8,1.2.37,PRINCE HENRY,now in as low an ebb as the foot of the ladder
152,Henry IV,8,1.2.38,PRINCE HENRY,and by and by in as high a flow as the ridge of the gallows.
153,Henry IV,9,1.2.39,FALSTAFF,"By the Lord, thou sayest true, lad. And is not my"
154,Henry IV,9,1.2.40,FALSTAFF,hostess of the tavern a most sweet wench?
155,Henry IV,10,1.2.41,PRINCE HENRY,"As the honey of Hybla, my old lad of the castle. And"
156,Henry IV,10,1.2.42,PRINCE HENRY,is not a buff jerkin a most sweet robe of durance?
157,Henry IV,11,1.2.43,FALSTAFF,"How now, how now, mad wag! what, in thy quips and"
158,Henry IV,11,1.2.44,FALSTAFF,thy quiddities? what a plague have I to do with a
159,Henry IV,11,1.2.45,FALSTAFF,buff jerkin?
160,Henry IV,12,1.2.46,PRINCE HENRY,"Why, what a pox have I to do with my hostess of the tavern?"
161,Henry IV,13,1.2.47,FALSTAFF,"Well, thou hast called her to a reckoning many a"
162,Henry IV,13,1.2.48,FALSTAFF,time and oft.
163,Henry IV,14,1.2.49,PRINCE HENRY,Did I ever call for thee to pay thy part?
164,Henry IV,15,1.2.50,FALSTAFF,"No, I'll give thee thy due, thou hast paid all there."
165,Henry IV,16,1.2.51,PRINCE HENRY,"Yea, and elsewhere, so far as my coin would stretch,"
166,Henry IV,16,1.2.52,PRINCE HENRY,"and where it would not, I have used my credit."
167,Henry IV,17,1.2.53,FALSTAFF,"Yea, and so used it that were it not here apparent"
168,Henry IV,17,1.2.54,FALSTAFF,"that thou art heir apparent--But, I prithee, sweet"
169,Henry IV,17,1.2.55,FALSTAFF,"wag, shall there be gallows standing in England when"
170,Henry IV,17,1.2.56,FALSTAFF,thou art king? and resolution thus fobbed as it is
171,Henry IV,17,1.2.57,FALSTAFF,with the rusty curb of old father antic the law? Do
172,Henry IV,17,1.2.58,FALSTAFF,"not thou, when thou art king, hang a thief."
173,Henry IV,18,1.2.59,PRINCE HENRY,"No, thou shalt."
174,Henry IV,19,1.2.60,FALSTAFF,"Shall I? O rare! By the Lord, I'll be a brave judge."
175,Henry IV,20,1.2.61,PRINCE HENRY,"Thou judgest false already: I mean, thou shalt have"
176,Henry IV,20,1.2.62,PRINCE HENRY,the hanging of the thieves and so become a rare hangman.
177,Henry IV,21,1.2.63,FALSTAFF,"Well, Hal, well, and in some sort it jumps with my"
178,Henry IV,21,1.2.64,FALSTAFF,"humour as well as waiting in the court, I can tell"
179,Henry IV,21,1.2.65,FALSTAFF,you.
180,Henry IV,22,1.2.66,PRINCE HENRY,For obtaining of suits?
181,Henry IV,23,1.2.67,FALSTAFF,"Yea, for obtaining of suits, whereof the hangman"
182,Henry IV,23,1.2.68,FALSTAFF,"hath no lean wardrobe. 'Sblood, I am as melancholy"
183,Henry IV,23,1.2.69,FALSTAFF,as a gib cat or a lugged bear.
184,Henry IV,24,1.2.70,PRINCE HENRY,"Or an old lion, or a lover's lute."
185,Henry IV,25,1.2.71,FALSTAFF,"Yea, or the drone of a Lincolnshire bagpipe."
186,Henry IV,26,1.2.72,PRINCE HENRY,"What sayest thou to a hare, or the melancholy of"
187,Henry IV,26,1.2.73,PRINCE HENRY,Moor-ditch?
188,Henry IV,27,1.2.74,FALSTAFF,Thou hast the most unsavoury similes and art indeed
189,Henry IV,27,1.2.75,FALSTAFF,"the most comparative, rascalliest, sweet young"
190,Henry IV,27,1.2.76,FALSTAFF,"prince. But, Hal, I prithee, trouble me no more"
191,Henry IV,27,1.2.77,FALSTAFF,with vanity. I would to God thou and I knew where a
192,Henry IV,27,1.2.78,FALSTAFF,commodity of good names were to be bought. An old
193,Henry IV,27,1.2.79,FALSTAFF,lord of the council rated me the other day in the
194,Henry IV,27,1.2.80,FALSTAFF,"street about you, sir, but I marked him not, and yet"
195,Henry IV,27,1.2.81,FALSTAFF,"he talked very wisely, but I regarded him not, and"
196,Henry IV,27,1.2.82,FALSTAFF,"yet he talked wisely, and in the street too."
197,Henry IV,28,1.2.83,PRINCE HENRY,"Thou didst well, for wisdom cries out in the"
198,Henry IV,28,1.2.84,PRINCE HENRY,"streets, and no man regards it."
199,Henry IV,29,1.2.85,FALSTAFF,"O, thou hast damnable iteration and art indeed able"
200,Henry IV,29,1.2.86,FALSTAFF,to corrupt a saint. Thou hast done much harm upon
201,Henry IV,29,1.2.87,FALSTAFF,"me, Hal, God forgive thee for it! Before I knew"
202,Henry IV,29,1.2.88,FALSTAFF,"thee, Hal, I knew nothing, and now am I, if a man"
203,Henry IV,29,1.2.89,FALSTAFF,"should speak truly, little better than one of the"
204,Henry IV,29,1.2.90,FALSTAFF,"wicked. I must give over this life, and I will give"
205,Henry IV,29,1.2.91,FALSTAFF,"it over: by the Lord, and I do not, I am a villain:"
206,Henry IV,29,1.2.92,FALSTAFF,I'll be damned for never a king's son in
207,Henry IV,29,1.2.93,FALSTAFF,Christendom.
208,Henry IV,30,1.2.94,PRINCE HENRY,"Where shall we take a purse tomorrow, Jack?"
209,Henry IV,31,1.2.95,FALSTAFF,"'Zounds, where thou wilt, lad, I'll make one, an I"
210,Henry IV,31,1.2.96,FALSTAFF,"do not, call me villain and baffle me."
211,Henry IV,32,1.2.97,PRINCE HENRY,"I see a good amendment of life in thee, from praying"
212,Henry IV,32,1.2.98,PRINCE HENRY,to purse-taking.
213,Henry IV,33,1.2.99,FALSTAFF,"Why, Hal, 'tis my vocation, Hal, 'tis no sin for a"
214,Henry IV,33,1.2.100,FALSTAFF,man to labour in his vocation.
215,Henry IV,33,,FALSTAFF,Enter POINS
216,Henry IV,33,1.2.101,FALSTAFF,Poins! Now shall we know if Gadshill have set a
217,Henry IV,33,1.2.102,FALSTAFF,"match. O, if men were to be saved by merit, what"
218,Henry IV,33,1.2.103,FALSTAFF,hole in hell were hot enough for him? This is the
219,Henry IV,33,1.2.104,FALSTAFF,most omnipotent villain that ever cried 'Stand' to
220,Henry IV,33,1.2.105,FALSTAFF,a true man.
221,Henry IV,34,1.2.106,PRINCE HENRY,"Good morrow, Ned."
222,Henry IV,35,1.2.107,POINS,"Good morrow, sweet Hal. What says Monsieur Remorse?"
223,Henry IV,35,1.2.108,POINS,what says Sir John Sack and Sugar? Jack! how
224,Henry IV,35,1.2.109,POINS,"agrees the devil and thee about thy soul, that thou"
225,Henry IV,35,1.2.110,POINS,soldest him on Good-Friday last for a cup of Madeira
226,Henry IV,35,1.2.111,POINS,and a cold capon's leg?
227,Henry IV,36,1.2.112,PRINCE HENRY,"Sir John stands to his word, the devil shall have"
228,Henry IV,36,1.2.113,PRINCE HENRY,"his bargain, for he was never yet a breaker of"
229,Henry IV,36,1.2.114,PRINCE HENRY,proverbs: he will give the devil his due.
230,Henry IV,37,1.2.115,POINS,Then art thou damned for keeping thy word with the devil.
231,Henry IV,38,1.2.116,PRINCE HENRY,Else he had been damned for cozening the devil.
232,Henry IV,39,1.2.117,POINS,"But, my lads, my lads, to-morrow morning, by four"
233,Henry IV,39,1.2.118,POINS,"o'clock, early at Gadshill! there are pilgrims going"
234,Henry IV,39,1.2.119,POINS,"to Canterbury with rich offerings, and traders"
235,Henry IV,39,1.2.120,POINS,riding to London with fat purses: I have vizards
236,Henry IV,39,1.2.121,POINS,"for you all, you have horses for yourselves:"
237,Henry IV,39,1.2.122,POINS,Gadshill lies to-night in Rochester: I have bespoke
238,Henry IV,39,1.2.123,POINS,supper to-morrow night in Eastcheap: we may do it
239,Henry IV,39,1.2.124,POINS,"as secure as sleep. If you will go, I will stuff"
240,Henry IV,39,1.2.125,POINS,"your purses full of crowns, if you will not, tarry"
241,Henry IV,39,1.2.126,POINS,at home and be hanged.
242,Henry IV,40,1.2.127,FALSTAFF,"Hear ye, Yedward, if I tarry at home and go not,"
243,Henry IV,40,1.2.128,FALSTAFF,I'll hang you for going.
244,Henry IV,41,1.2.129,POINS,"You will, chops?"
245,Henry IV,42,1.2.130,FALSTAFF,"Hal, wilt thou make one?"
246,Henry IV,43,1.2.131,PRINCE HENRY,"Who, I rob? I a thief? not I, by my faith."
247,Henry IV,44,1.2.132,FALSTAFF,"There's neither honesty, manhood, nor good"
248,Henry IV,44,1.2.133,FALSTAFF,"fellowship in thee, nor thou camest not of the blood"
249,Henry IV,44,1.2.134,FALSTAFF,"royal, if thou darest not stand for ten shillings."
250,Henry IV,45,1.2.135,PRINCE HENRY,"Well then, once in my days I'll be a madcap."
251,Henry IV,46,1.2.136,FALSTAFF,"Why, that's well said."
252,Henry IV,47,1.2.137,PRINCE HENRY,"Well, come what will, I'll tarry at home."
253,Henry IV,48,1.2.138,FALSTAFF,"By the Lord, I'll be a traitor then, when thou art king."
254,Henry IV,49,1.2.139,PRINCE HENRY,I care not.
255,Henry IV,50,1.2.140,POINS,"Sir John, I prithee, leave the prince and me alone:"
256,Henry IV,50,1.2.141,POINS,I will lay him down such reasons for this adventure
257,Henry IV,50,1.2.142,POINS,that he shall go.
258,Henry IV,51,1.2.143,FALSTAFF,"Well, God give thee the spirit of persuasion and him"
259,Henry IV,51,1.2.144,FALSTAFF,"the ears of profiting, that what thou speakest may"
260,Henry IV,51,1.2.145,FALSTAFF,"move and what he hears may be believed, that the"
261,Henry IV,51,1.2.146,FALSTAFF,"true prince may, for recreation sake, prove a false"
262,Henry IV,51,1.2.147,FALSTAFF,"thief, for the poor abuses of the time want"
263,Henry IV,51,1.2.148,FALSTAFF,countenance. Farewell: you shall find me in Eastcheap.
264,Henry IV,52,1.2.149,PRINCE HENRY,"Farewell, thou latter spring! farewell, All-hallown summer!"
265,Henry IV,52,,PRINCE HENRY,Exit Falstaff
266,Henry IV,53,1.2.150,POINS,"Now, my good sweet honey lord, ride with us"
267,Henry IV,53,1.2.151,POINS,to-morrow: I have a jest to execute that I cannot
268,Henry IV,53,1.2.152,POINS,"manage alone. Falstaff, Bardolph, Peto and Gadshill"
269,Henry IV,53,1.2.153,POINS,shall rob those men that we have already waylaid:
270,Henry IV,53,1.2.154,POINS,"yourself and I will not be there, and when they"
271,Henry IV,53,1.2.155,POINS,"have the booty, if you and I do not rob them, cut"
272,Henry IV,53,1.2.156,POINS,this head off from my shoulders.
273,Henry IV,54,1.2.157,PRINCE HENRY,How shall we part with them in setting forth?
274,Henry IV,55,1.2.158,POINS,"Why, we will set forth before or after them, and"
275,Henry IV,55,1.2.159,POINS,"appoint them a place of meeting, wherein it is at"
276,Henry IV,55,1.2.160,POINS,"our pleasure to fail, and then will they adventure"
277,Henry IV,55,1.2.161,POINS,"upon the exploit themselves, which they shall have"
278,Henry IV,55,1.2.162,POINS,"no sooner achieved, but we'll set upon them."
279,Henry IV,56,1.2.163,PRINCE HENRY,"Yea, but 'tis like that they will know us by our"
280,Henry IV,56,1.2.164,PRINCE HENRY,"horses, by our habits and by every other"
281,Henry IV,56,1.2.165,PRINCE HENRY,"appointment, to be ourselves."
282,Henry IV,57,1.2.166,POINS,Tut! our horses they shall not see: I'll tie them
283,Henry IV,57,1.2.167,POINS,"in the wood, our vizards we will change after we"
284,Henry IV,57,1.2.168,POINS,"leave them: and, sirrah, I have cases of buckram"
285,Henry IV,57,1.2.169,POINS,"for the nonce, to immask our noted outward garments."
286,Henry IV,58,1.2.170,PRINCE HENRY,"Yea, but I doubt they will be too hard for us."
287,Henry IV,59,1.2.171,POINS,"Well, for two of them, I know them to be as"
288,Henry IV,59,1.2.172,POINS,"true-bred cowards as ever turned back, and for the"
289,Henry IV,59,1.2.173,POINS,"third, if he fight longer than he sees reason, I'll"
290,Henry IV,59,1.2.174,POINS,"forswear arms. The virtue of this jest will be, the"
291,Henry IV,59,1.2.175,POINS,incomprehensible lies that this same fat rogue will
292,Henry IV,59,1.2.176,POINS,"tell us when we meet at supper: how thirty, at"
293,Henry IV,59,1.2.177,POINS,"least, he fought with, what wards, what blows, what"
294,Henry IV,59,1.2.178,POINS,"extremities he endured, and in the reproof of this"
295,Henry IV,59,1.2.179,POINS,lies the jest.
296,Henry IV,60,1.2.180,PRINCE HENRY,"Well, I'll go with thee: provide us all things"
297,Henry IV,60,1.2.181,PRINCE HENRY,"necessary and meet me to-morrow night in Eastcheap,"
298,Henry IV,60,1.2.182,PRINCE HENRY,there I'll sup. Farewell.
299,Henry IV,61,1.2.183,POINS,"Farewell, my lord."
300,Henry IV,61,,POINS,Exit Poins
301,Henry IV,62,1.2.184,PRINCE HENRY,"I know you all, and will awhile uphold"
302,Henry IV,62,1.2.185,PRINCE HENRY,The unyoked humour of your idleness:
303,Henry IV,62,1.2.186,PRINCE HENRY,"Yet herein will I imitate the sun,"
304,Henry IV,62,1.2.187,PRINCE HENRY,Who doth permit the base contagious clouds
305,Henry IV,62,1.2.188,PRINCE HENRY,"To smother up his beauty from the world,"
306,Henry IV,62,1.2.189,PRINCE HENRY,"That, when he please again to be himself,"
307,Henry IV,62,1.2.190,PRINCE HENRY,"Being wanted, he may be more wonder'd at,"
308,Henry IV,62,1.2.191,PRINCE HENRY,By breaking through the foul and ugly mists
309,Henry IV,62,1.2.192,PRINCE HENRY,Of vapours that did seem to strangle him.
310,Henry IV,62,1.2.193,PRINCE HENRY,"If all the year were playing holidays,"
311,Henry IV,62,1.2.194,PRINCE HENRY,"To sport would be as tedious as to work,"
312,Henry IV,62,1.2.195,PRINCE HENRY,"But when they seldom come, they wish'd for come,"
313,Henry IV,62,1.2.196,PRINCE HENRY,And nothing pleaseth but rare accidents.
314,Henry IV,62,1.2.197,PRINCE HENRY,"So, when this loose behavior I throw off"
315,Henry IV,62,1.2.198,PRINCE HENRY,"And pay the debt I never promised,"
316,Henry IV,62,1.2.199,PRINCE HENRY,"By how much better than my word I am,"
317,Henry IV,62,1.2.200,PRINCE HENRY,"By so much shall I falsify men's hopes,"
318,Henry IV,62,1.2.201,PRINCE HENRY,"And like bright metal on a sullen ground,"
319,Henry IV,62,1.2.202,PRINCE HENRY,"My reformation, glittering o'er my fault,"
320,Henry IV,62,1.2.203,PRINCE HENRY,Shall show more goodly and attract more eyes
321,Henry IV,62,1.2.204,PRINCE HENRY,Than that which hath no foil to set it off.
322,Henry IV,62,1.2.205,PRINCE HENRY,"I'll so offend, to make offence a skill,"
323,Henry IV,62,1.2.206,PRINCE HENRY,Redeeming time when men think least I will.
324,Henry IV,62,,PRINCE HENRY,Exit
325,Henry IV,62,,PRINCE HENRY,SCENE III. London. The palace.
326,Henry IV,62,,PRINCE HENRY,"Enter the KING, NORTHUMBERLAND, WORCESTER, HOTSPUR, SIR WALTER BLUNT, with others"
327,Henry IV,1,1.3.1,KING HENRY IV,"My blood hath been too cold and temperate,"
328,Henry IV,1,1.3.2,KING HENRY IV,"Unapt to stir at these indignities,"
329,Henry IV,1,1.3.3,KING HENRY IV,"And you have found me, for accordingly"
330,Henry IV,1,1.3.4,KING HENRY IV,You tread upon my patience: but be sure
331,Henry IV,1,1.3.5,KING HENRY IV,"I will from henceforth rather be myself,"
332,Henry IV,1,1.3.6,KING HENRY IV,"Mighty and to be fear'd, than my condition,"
333,Henry IV,1,1.3.7,KING HENRY IV,"Which hath been smooth as oil, soft as young down,"
334,Henry IV,1,1.3.8,KING HENRY IV,And therefore lost that title of respect
335,Henry IV,1,1.3.9,KING HENRY IV,Which the proud soul ne'er pays but to the proud.
336,Henry IV,2,1.3.10,EARL OF WORCESTER,"Our house, my sovereign liege, little deserves"
337,Henry IV,2,1.3.11,EARL OF WORCESTER,"The scourge of greatness to be used on it,"
338,Henry IV,2,1.3.12,EARL OF WORCESTER,And that same greatness too which our own hands
339,Henry IV,2,1.3.13,EARL OF WORCESTER,Have holp to make so portly.
340,Henry IV,3,1.3.14,NORTHUMBERLAND,My lord.--
341,Henry IV,4,1.3.15,KING HENRY IV,"Worcester, get thee gone, for I do see"
342,Henry IV,4,1.3.16,KING HENRY IV,Danger and disobedience in thine eye:
343,Henry IV,4,1.3.17,KING HENRY IV,"O, sir, your presence is too bold and peremptory,"
344,Henry IV,4,1.3.18,KING HENRY IV,And majesty might never yet endure
345,Henry IV,4,1.3.19,KING HENRY IV,The moody frontier of a servant brow.
346,Henry IV,4,1.3.20,KING HENRY IV,You have good leave to leave us: when we need
347,Henry IV,4,1.3.21,KING HENRY IV,"Your use and counsel, we shall send for you."
348,Henry IV,4,,KING HENRY IV,Exit Worcester
349,Henry IV,4,1.3.22,KING HENRY IV,You were about to speak.
350,Henry IV,4,,KING HENRY IV,To North
351,Henry IV,5,1.3.23,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Yea, my good lord."
352,Henry IV,5,1.3.24,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Those prisoners in your highness' name demanded,"
353,Henry IV,5,1.3.25,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Which Harry Percy here at Holmedon took,"
354,Henry IV,5,1.3.26,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Were, as he says, not with such strength denied"
355,Henry IV,5,1.3.27,NORTHUMBERLAND,As is deliver'd to your majesty:
356,Henry IV,5,1.3.28,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Either envy, therefore, or misprison"
357,Henry IV,5,1.3.29,NORTHUMBERLAND,Is guilty of this fault and not my son.
358,Henry IV,6,1.3.30,HOTSPUR,"My liege, I did deny no prisoners."
359,Henry IV,6,1.3.31,HOTSPUR,"But I remember, when the fight was done,"
360,Henry IV,6,1.3.32,HOTSPUR,"When I was dry with rage and extreme toil,"
361,Henry IV,6,1.3.33,HOTSPUR,"Breathless and faint, leaning upon my sword,"
362,Henry IV,6,1.3.34,HOTSPUR,"Came there a certain lord, neat, and trimly dress'd,"
363,Henry IV,6,1.3.35,HOTSPUR,"Fresh as a bridegroom, and his chin new reap'd"
364,Henry IV,6,1.3.36,HOTSPUR,"Show'd like a stubble-land at harvest-home,"
365,Henry IV,6,1.3.37,HOTSPUR,"He was perfumed like a milliner,"
366,Henry IV,6,1.3.38,HOTSPUR,And 'twixt his finger and his thumb he held
367,Henry IV,6,1.3.39,HOTSPUR,"A pouncet-box, which ever and anon"
368,Henry IV,6,1.3.40,HOTSPUR,"He gave his nose and took't away again,"
369,Henry IV,6,1.3.41,HOTSPUR,"Who therewith angry, when it next came there,"
370,Henry IV,6,1.3.42,HOTSPUR,"Took it in snuff, and still he smiled and talk'd,"
371,Henry IV,6,1.3.43,HOTSPUR,"And as the soldiers bore dead bodies by,"
372,Henry IV,6,1.3.44,HOTSPUR,"He call'd them untaught knaves, unmannerly,"
373,Henry IV,6,1.3.45,HOTSPUR,To bring a slovenly unhandsome corse
374,Henry IV,6,1.3.46,HOTSPUR,Betwixt the wind and his nobility.
375,Henry IV,6,1.3.47,HOTSPUR,With many holiday and lady terms
376,Henry IV,6,1.3.48,HOTSPUR,"He question'd me, amongst the rest, demanded"
377,Henry IV,6,1.3.49,HOTSPUR,My prisoners in your majesty's behalf.
378,Henry IV,6,1.3.50,HOTSPUR,"I then, all smarting with my wounds being cold,"
379,Henry IV,6,1.3.51,HOTSPUR,"To be so pester'd with a popinjay,"
380,Henry IV,6,1.3.52,HOTSPUR,"Out of my grief and my impatience,"
381,Henry IV,6,1.3.53,HOTSPUR,"Answer'd neglectingly I know not what,"
382,Henry IV,6,1.3.54,HOTSPUR,"He should or he should not, for he made me mad"
383,Henry IV,6,1.3.55,HOTSPUR,To see him shine so brisk and smell so sweet
384,Henry IV,6,1.3.56,HOTSPUR,And talk so like a waiting-gentlewoman
385,Henry IV,6,1.3.57,HOTSPUR,"Of guns and drums and wounds,--God save the mark!--"
386,Henry IV,6,1.3.58,HOTSPUR,And telling me the sovereign'st thing on earth
387,Henry IV,6,1.3.59,HOTSPUR,"Was parmaceti for an inward bruise,"
388,Henry IV,6,1.3.60,HOTSPUR,"And that it was great pity, so it was,"
389,Henry IV,6,1.3.61,HOTSPUR,This villanous salt-petre should be digg'd
390,Henry IV,6,1.3.62,HOTSPUR,"Out of the bowels of the harmless earth,"
391,Henry IV,6,1.3.63,HOTSPUR,Which many a good tall fellow had destroy'd
392,Henry IV,6,1.3.64,HOTSPUR,"So cowardly, and but for these vile guns,"
393,Henry IV,6,1.3.65,HOTSPUR,He would himself have been a soldier.
394,Henry IV,6,1.3.66,HOTSPUR,"This bald unjointed chat of his, my lord,"
395,Henry IV,6,1.3.67,HOTSPUR,"I answer'd indirectly, as I said,"
396,Henry IV,6,1.3.68,HOTSPUR,"And I beseech you, let not his report"
397,Henry IV,6,1.3.69,HOTSPUR,Come current for an accusation
398,Henry IV,6,1.3.70,HOTSPUR,Betwixt my love and your high majesty.
399,Henry IV,7,1.3.71,SIR WALTER BLUNT,"The circumstance consider'd, good my lord,"
400,Henry IV,7,1.3.72,SIR WALTER BLUNT,Whate'er Lord Harry Percy then had said
401,Henry IV,7,1.3.73,SIR WALTER BLUNT,"To such a person and in such a place,"
402,Henry IV,7,1.3.74,SIR WALTER BLUNT,"At such a time, with all the rest retold,"
403,Henry IV,7,1.3.75,SIR WALTER BLUNT,May reasonably die and never rise
404,Henry IV,7,1.3.76,SIR WALTER BLUNT,To do him wrong or any way impeach
405,Henry IV,7,1.3.77,SIR WALTER BLUNT,"What then he said, so he unsay it now."
406,Henry IV,8,1.3.78,KING HENRY IV,"Why, yet he doth deny his prisoners,"
407,Henry IV,8,1.3.79,KING HENRY IV,"But with proviso and exception,"
408,Henry IV,8,1.3.80,KING HENRY IV,That we at our own charge shall ransom straight
409,Henry IV,8,1.3.81,KING HENRY IV,"His brother-in-law, the foolish Mortimer,"
410,Henry IV,8,1.3.82,KING HENRY IV,"Who, on my soul, hath wilfully betray'd"
411,Henry IV,8,1.3.83,KING HENRY IV,The lives of those that he did lead to fight
412,Henry IV,8,1.3.84,KING HENRY IV,"Against that great magician, damn'd Glendower,"
413,Henry IV,8,1.3.85,KING HENRY IV,"Whose daughter, as we hear, the Earl of March"
414,Henry IV,8,1.3.86,KING HENRY IV,"Hath lately married. Shall our coffers, then,"
415,Henry IV,8,1.3.87,KING HENRY IV,Be emptied to redeem a traitor home?
416,Henry IV,8,1.3.88,KING HENRY IV,"Shall we but treason? and indent with fears,"
417,Henry IV,8,1.3.89,KING HENRY IV,When they have lost and forfeited themselves?
418,Henry IV,8,1.3.90,KING HENRY IV,"No, on the barren mountains let him starve,"
419,Henry IV,8,1.3.91,KING HENRY IV,For I shall never hold that man my friend
420,Henry IV,8,1.3.92,KING HENRY IV,Whose tongue shall ask me for one penny cost
421,Henry IV,8,1.3.93,KING HENRY IV,To ransom home revolted Mortimer.
422,Henry IV,9,1.3.94,HOTSPUR,Revolted Mortimer!
423,Henry IV,9,1.3.95,HOTSPUR,"He never did fall off, my sovereign liege,"
424,Henry IV,9,1.3.96,HOTSPUR,"But by the chance of war, to prove that true"
425,Henry IV,9,1.3.97,HOTSPUR,"Needs no more but one tongue for all those wounds,"
426,Henry IV,9,1.3.98,HOTSPUR,"Those mouthed wounds, which valiantly he took"
427,Henry IV,9,1.3.99,HOTSPUR,"When on the gentle Severn's sedgy bank,"
428,Henry IV,9,1.3.100,HOTSPUR,"In single opposition, hand to hand,"
429,Henry IV,9,1.3.101,HOTSPUR,He did confound the best part of an hour
430,Henry IV,9,1.3.102,HOTSPUR,In changing hardiment with great Glendower:
431,Henry IV,9,1.3.103,HOTSPUR,Three times they breathed and three times did
432,Henry IV,9,1.3.104,HOTSPUR,"they drink,"
433,Henry IV,9,1.3.105,HOTSPUR,"Upon agreement, of swift Severn's flood,"
434,Henry IV,9,1.3.106,HOTSPUR,"Who then, affrighted with their bloody looks,"
435,Henry IV,9,1.3.107,HOTSPUR,"Ran fearfully among the trembling reeds,"
436,Henry IV,9,1.3.108,HOTSPUR,"And hid his crisp head in the hollow bank,"
437,Henry IV,9,1.3.109,HOTSPUR,Bloodstained with these valiant combatants.
438,Henry IV,9,1.3.110,HOTSPUR,Never did base and rotten policy
439,Henry IV,9,1.3.111,HOTSPUR,"Colour her working with such deadly wounds,"
440,Henry IV,9,1.3.112,HOTSPUR,Nor could the noble Mortimer
441,Henry IV,9,1.3.113,HOTSPUR,"Receive so many, and all willingly:"
442,Henry IV,9,1.3.114,HOTSPUR,Then let not him be slander'd with revolt.
443,Henry IV,10,1.3.115,KING HENRY IV,"Thou dost belie him, Percy, thou dost belie him,"
444,Henry IV,10,1.3.116,KING HENRY IV,He never did encounter with Glendower:
445,Henry IV,10,1.3.117,KING HENRY IV,"I tell thee,"
446,Henry IV,10,1.3.118,KING HENRY IV,He durst as well have met the devil alone
447,Henry IV,10,1.3.119,KING HENRY IV,As Owen Glendower for an enemy.
448,Henry IV,10,1.3.120,KING HENRY IV,"Art thou not ashamed? But, sirrah, henceforth"
449,Henry IV,10,1.3.121,KING HENRY IV,Let me not hear you speak of Mortimer:
450,Henry IV,10,1.3.122,KING HENRY IV,"Send me your prisoners with the speediest means,"
451,Henry IV,10,1.3.123,KING HENRY IV,Or you shall hear in such a kind from me
452,Henry IV,10,1.3.124,KING HENRY IV,"As will displease you. My Lord Northumberland,"
453,Henry IV,10,1.3.125,KING HENRY IV,We licence your departure with your son.
454,Henry IV,10,1.3.126,KING HENRY IV,"Send us your prisoners, or you will hear of it."
455,Henry IV,10,,KING HENRY IV,"Exeunt King Henry, Blunt, and train"
456,Henry IV,11,1.3.127,HOTSPUR,"An if the devil come and roar for them,"
457,Henry IV,11,1.3.128,HOTSPUR,I will not send them: I will after straight
458,Henry IV,11,1.3.129,HOTSPUR,"And tell him so, for I will ease my heart,"
459,Henry IV,11,1.3.130,HOTSPUR,Albeit I make a hazard of my head.
460,Henry IV,12,1.3.131,NORTHUMBERLAND,"What, drunk with choler? stay and pause awhile:"
461,Henry IV,12,1.3.132,NORTHUMBERLAND,Here comes your uncle.
462,Henry IV,12,,NORTHUMBERLAND,Re-enter WORCESTER
463,Henry IV,13,1.3.133,HOTSPUR,Speak of Mortimer!
464,Henry IV,13,1.3.134,HOTSPUR,"'Zounds, I will speak of him, and let my soul"
465,Henry IV,13,1.3.135,HOTSPUR,"Want mercy, if I do not join with him:"
466,Henry IV,13,1.3.136,HOTSPUR,"Yea, on his part I'll empty all these veins,"
467,Henry IV,13,1.3.137,HOTSPUR,"And shed my dear blood drop by drop in the dust,"
468,Henry IV,13,1.3.138,HOTSPUR,But I will lift the down-trod Mortimer
469,Henry IV,13,1.3.139,HOTSPUR,"As high in the air as this unthankful king,"
470,Henry IV,13,1.3.140,HOTSPUR,As this ingrate and canker'd Bolingbroke.
471,Henry IV,14,1.3.141,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Brother, the king hath made your nephew mad."
472,Henry IV,15,1.3.142,EARL OF WORCESTER,Who struck this heat up after I was gone?
473,Henry IV,16,1.3.143,HOTSPUR,"He will, forsooth, have all my prisoners,"
474,Henry IV,16,1.3.144,HOTSPUR,And when I urged the ransom once again
475,Henry IV,16,1.3.145,HOTSPUR,"Of my wife's brother, then his cheek look'd pale,"
476,Henry IV,16,1.3.146,HOTSPUR,"And on my face he turn'd an eye of death,"
477,Henry IV,16,1.3.147,HOTSPUR,Trembling even at the name of Mortimer.
478,Henry IV,17,1.3.148,EARL OF WORCESTER,I cannot blame him: was not he proclaim'd
479,Henry IV,17,1.3.149,EARL OF WORCESTER,By Richard that dead is the next of blood?
480,Henry IV,18,1.3.150,NORTHUMBERLAND,"He was, I heard the proclamation:"
481,Henry IV,18,1.3.151,NORTHUMBERLAND,"And then it was when the unhappy king,"
482,Henry IV,18,1.3.152,NORTHUMBERLAND,--Whose wrongs in us God pardon!--did set forth
483,Henry IV,18,1.3.153,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Upon his Irish expedition,"
484,Henry IV,18,1.3.154,NORTHUMBERLAND,From whence he intercepted did return
485,Henry IV,18,1.3.155,NORTHUMBERLAND,To be deposed and shortly murdered.
486,Henry IV,19,1.3.156,EARL OF WORCESTER,And for whose death we in the world's wide mouth
487,Henry IV,19,1.3.157,EARL OF WORCESTER,Live scandalized and foully spoken of.
488,Henry IV,20,1.3.158,HOTSPUR,"But soft, I pray you, did King Richard then"
489,Henry IV,20,1.3.159,HOTSPUR,Proclaim my brother Edmund Mortimer
490,Henry IV,20,1.3.160,HOTSPUR,Heir to the crown?
491,Henry IV,21,1.3.161,NORTHUMBERLAND,"He did, myself did hear it."
492,Henry IV,22,1.3.162,HOTSPUR,"Nay, then I cannot blame his cousin king,"
493,Henry IV,22,1.3.163,HOTSPUR,That wished him on the barren mountains starve.
494,Henry IV,22,1.3.164,HOTSPUR,"But shall it be that you, that set the crown"
495,Henry IV,22,1.3.165,HOTSPUR,Upon the head of this forgetful man
496,Henry IV,22,1.3.166,HOTSPUR,And for his sake wear the detested blot
497,Henry IV,22,1.3.167,HOTSPUR,"Of murderous subornation, shall it be,"
498,Henry IV,22,1.3.168,HOTSPUR,"That you a world of curses undergo,"
499,Henry IV,22,1.3.169,HOTSPUR,"Being the agents, or base second means,"
500,Henry IV,22,1.3.170,HOTSPUR,"The cords, the ladder, or the hangman rather?"
501,Henry IV,22,1.3.171,HOTSPUR,"O, pardon me that I descend so low,"
502,Henry IV,22,1.3.172,HOTSPUR,To show the line and the predicament
503,Henry IV,22,1.3.173,HOTSPUR,"Wherein you range under this subtle king,"
504,Henry IV,22,1.3.174,HOTSPUR,"Shall it for shame be spoken in these days,"
505,Henry IV,22,1.3.175,HOTSPUR,"Or fill up chronicles in time to come,"
506,Henry IV,22,1.3.176,HOTSPUR,That men of your nobility and power
507,Henry IV,22,1.3.177,HOTSPUR,"Did gage them both in an unjust behalf,"
508,Henry IV,22,1.3.178,HOTSPUR,"As both of you--God pardon it!--have done,"
509,Henry IV,22,1.3.179,HOTSPUR,"To put down Richard, that sweet lovely rose,"
510,Henry IV,22,1.3.180,HOTSPUR,"An plant this thorn, this canker, Bolingbroke?"
511,Henry IV,22,1.3.181,HOTSPUR,"And shall it in more shame be further spoken,"
512,Henry IV,22,1.3.182,HOTSPUR,"That you are fool'd, discarded and shook off"
513,Henry IV,22,1.3.183,HOTSPUR,By him for whom these shames ye underwent?
514,Henry IV,22,1.3.184,HOTSPUR,"No, yet time serves wherein you may redeem"
515,Henry IV,22,1.3.185,HOTSPUR,Your banish'd honours and restore yourselves
516,Henry IV,22,1.3.186,HOTSPUR,"Into the good thoughts of the world again,"
517,Henry IV,22,1.3.187,HOTSPUR,Revenge the jeering and disdain'd contempt
518,Henry IV,22,1.3.188,HOTSPUR,"Of this proud king, who studies day and night"
519,Henry IV,22,1.3.189,HOTSPUR,To answer all the debt he owes to you
520,Henry IV,22,1.3.190,HOTSPUR,Even with the bloody payment of your deaths:
521,Henry IV,22,1.3.191,HOTSPUR,"Therefore, I say--"
522,Henry IV,23,1.3.192,EARL OF WORCESTER,"Peace, cousin, say no more:"
523,Henry IV,23,1.3.193,EARL OF WORCESTER,"And now I will unclasp a secret book,"
524,Henry IV,23,1.3.194,EARL OF WORCESTER,And to your quick-conceiving discontents
525,Henry IV,23,1.3.195,EARL OF WORCESTER,"I'll read you matter deep and dangerous,"
526,Henry IV,23,1.3.196,EARL OF WORCESTER,As full of peril and adventurous spirit
527,Henry IV,23,1.3.197,EARL OF WORCESTER,As to o'er-walk a current roaring loud
528,Henry IV,23,1.3.198,EARL OF WORCESTER,On the unsteadfast footing of a spear.
529,Henry IV,24,1.3.199,HOTSPUR,"If he fall in, good night! or sink or swim:"
530,Henry IV,24,1.3.200,HOTSPUR,"Send danger from the east unto the west,"
531,Henry IV,24,1.3.201,HOTSPUR,"So honour cross it from the north to south,"
532,Henry IV,24,1.3.202,HOTSPUR,"And let them grapple: O, the blood more stirs"
533,Henry IV,24,1.3.203,HOTSPUR,To rouse a lion than to start a hare!
534,Henry IV,25,1.3.204,NORTHUMBERLAND,Imagination of some great exploit
535,Henry IV,25,1.3.205,NORTHUMBERLAND,Drives him beyond the bounds of patience.
536,Henry IV,26,1.3.206,HOTSPUR,"By heaven, methinks it were an easy leap,"
537,Henry IV,26,1.3.207,HOTSPUR,"To pluck bright honour from the pale-faced moon,"
538,Henry IV,26,1.3.208,HOTSPUR,"Or dive into the bottom of the deep,"
539,Henry IV,26,1.3.209,HOTSPUR,"Where fathom-line could never touch the ground,"
540,Henry IV,26,1.3.210,HOTSPUR,"And pluck up drowned honour by the locks,"
541,Henry IV,26,1.3.211,HOTSPUR,So he that doth redeem her thence might wear
542,Henry IV,26,1.3.212,HOTSPUR,"Without corrival, all her dignities:"
543,Henry IV,26,1.3.213,HOTSPUR,But out upon this half-faced fellowship!
544,Henry IV,27,1.3.214,EARL OF WORCESTER,"He apprehends a world of figures here,"
545,Henry IV,27,1.3.215,EARL OF WORCESTER,But not the form of what he should attend.
546,Henry IV,27,1.3.216,EARL OF WORCESTER,"Good cousin, give me audience for a while."
547,Henry IV,28,1.3.217,HOTSPUR,I cry you mercy.
548,Henry IV,29,1.3.218,EARL OF WORCESTER,Those same noble Scots
549,Henry IV,29,1.3.219,EARL OF WORCESTER,"That are your prisoners,--"
550,Henry IV,30,1.3.220,HOTSPUR,"I'll keep them all,"
551,Henry IV,30,1.3.221,HOTSPUR,"By God, he shall not have a Scot of them,"
552,Henry IV,30,1.3.222,HOTSPUR,"No, if a Scot would save his soul, he shall not:"
553,Henry IV,30,1.3.223,HOTSPUR,"I'll keep them, by this hand."
554,Henry IV,31,1.3.224,EARL OF WORCESTER,You start away
555,Henry IV,31,1.3.225,EARL OF WORCESTER,And lend no ear unto my purposes.
556,Henry IV,31,1.3.226,EARL OF WORCESTER,Those prisoners you shall keep.
557,Henry IV,32,1.3.227,HOTSPUR,"Nay, I will, that's flat:"
558,Henry IV,32,1.3.228,HOTSPUR,"He said he would not ransom Mortimer,"
559,Henry IV,32,1.3.229,HOTSPUR,"Forbad my tongue to speak of Mortimer,"
560,Henry IV,32,1.3.230,HOTSPUR,"But I will find him when he lies asleep,"
561,Henry IV,32,1.3.231,HOTSPUR,And in his ear I'll holla 'Mortimer!'
562,Henry IV,32,1.3.232,HOTSPUR,"Nay,"
563,Henry IV,32,1.3.233,HOTSPUR,I'll have a starling shall be taught to speak
564,Henry IV,32,1.3.234,HOTSPUR,"Nothing but 'Mortimer,' and give it him"
565,Henry IV,32,1.3.235,HOTSPUR,To keep his anger still in motion.
566,Henry IV,33,1.3.236,EARL OF WORCESTER,"Hear you, cousin, a word."
567,Henry IV,34,1.3.237,HOTSPUR,"All studies here I solemnly defy,"
568,Henry IV,34,1.3.238,HOTSPUR,Save how to gall and pinch this Bolingbroke:
569,Henry IV,34,1.3.239,HOTSPUR,"And that same sword-and-buckler Prince of Wales,"
570,Henry IV,34,1.3.240,HOTSPUR,But that I think his father loves him not
571,Henry IV,34,1.3.241,HOTSPUR,"And would be glad he met with some mischance,"
572,Henry IV,34,1.3.242,HOTSPUR,I would have him poison'd with a pot of ale.
573,Henry IV,35,1.3.243,EARL OF WORCESTER,"Farewell, kinsman: I'll talk to you"
574,Henry IV,35,1.3.244,EARL OF WORCESTER,When you are better temper'd to attend.
575,Henry IV,36,1.3.245,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Why, what a wasp-stung and impatient fool"
576,Henry IV,36,1.3.246,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Art thou to break into this woman's mood,"
577,Henry IV,36,1.3.247,NORTHUMBERLAND,Tying thine ear to no tongue but thine own!
578,Henry IV,37,1.3.248,HOTSPUR,"Why, look you, I am whipp'd and scourged with rods,"
579,Henry IV,37,1.3.249,HOTSPUR,"Nettled and stung with pismires, when I hear"
580,Henry IV,37,1.3.250,HOTSPUR,"Of this vile politician, Bolingbroke."
581,Henry IV,37,1.3.251,HOTSPUR,"In Richard's time,--what do you call the place?--"
582,Henry IV,37,1.3.252,HOTSPUR,"A plague upon it, it is in Gloucestershire,"
583,Henry IV,37,1.3.253,HOTSPUR,"'Twas where the madcap duke his uncle kept,"
584,Henry IV,37,1.3.254,HOTSPUR,"His uncle York, where I first bow'd my knee"
585,Henry IV,37,1.3.255,HOTSPUR,"Unto this king of smiles, this Bolingbroke,--"
586,Henry IV,37,1.3.256,HOTSPUR,'Sblood!--
587,Henry IV,37,1.3.257,HOTSPUR,When you and he came back from Ravenspurgh.
588,Henry IV,38,1.3.258,NORTHUMBERLAND,At Berkley castle.
589,Henry IV,39,1.3.259,HOTSPUR,You say true:
590,Henry IV,39,1.3.260,HOTSPUR,"Why, what a candy deal of courtesy"
591,Henry IV,39,1.3.261,HOTSPUR,This fawning greyhound then did proffer me!
592,Henry IV,39,1.3.262,HOTSPUR,"Look,'when his infant fortune came to age,'"
593,Henry IV,39,1.3.263,HOTSPUR,"And 'gentle Harry Percy,' and 'kind cousin,'"
594,Henry IV,39,1.3.264,HOTSPUR,"O, the devil take such cozeners! God forgive me!"
595,Henry IV,39,1.3.265,HOTSPUR,"Good uncle, tell your tale, I have done."
596,Henry IV,40,1.3.266,EARL OF WORCESTER,"Nay, if you have not, to it again,"
597,Henry IV,40,1.3.267,EARL OF WORCESTER,We will stay your leisure.
598,Henry IV,41,1.3.268,HOTSPUR,"I have done, i' faith."
599,Henry IV,42,1.3.269,EARL OF WORCESTER,Then once more to your Scottish prisoners.
600,Henry IV,42,1.3.270,EARL OF WORCESTER,"Deliver them up without their ransom straight,"
601,Henry IV,42,1.3.271,EARL OF WORCESTER,And make the Douglas' son your only mean
602,Henry IV,42,1.3.272,EARL OF WORCESTER,"For powers in Scotland, which, for divers reasons"
603,Henry IV,42,1.3.273,EARL OF WORCESTER,"Which I shall send you written, be assured,"
604,Henry IV,42,1.3.274,EARL OF WORCESTER,"Will easily be granted. You, my lord,"
605,Henry IV,42,,EARL OF WORCESTER,To Northumberland
606,Henry IV,42,1.3.275,EARL OF WORCESTER,"Your son in Scotland being thus employ'd,"
607,Henry IV,42,1.3.276,EARL OF WORCESTER,Shall secretly into the bosom creep
608,Henry IV,42,1.3.277,EARL OF WORCESTER,"Of that same noble prelate, well beloved,"
609,Henry IV,42,1.3.278,EARL OF WORCESTER,The archbishop.
610,Henry IV,43,1.3.279,HOTSPUR,"Of York, is it not?"
611,Henry IV,44,1.3.280,EARL OF WORCESTER,"True, who bears hard"
612,Henry IV,44,1.3.281,EARL OF WORCESTER,"His brother's death at Bristol, the Lord Scroop."
613,Henry IV,44,1.3.282,EARL OF WORCESTER,"I speak not this in estimation,"
614,Henry IV,44,1.3.283,EARL OF WORCESTER,"As what I think might be, but what I know"
615,Henry IV,44,1.3.284,EARL OF WORCESTER,"Is ruminated, plotted and set down,"
616,Henry IV,44,1.3.285,EARL OF WORCESTER,And only stays but to behold the face
617,Henry IV,44,1.3.286,EARL OF WORCESTER,Of that occasion that shall bring it on.
618,Henry IV,45,1.3.287,HOTSPUR,"I smell it: upon my life, it will do well."
619,Henry IV,46,1.3.288,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Before the game is afoot, thou still let'st slip."
620,Henry IV,47,1.3.289,HOTSPUR,"Why, it cannot choose but be a noble plot,"
621,Henry IV,47,1.3.290,HOTSPUR,"And then the power of Scotland and of York,"
622,Henry IV,47,1.3.291,HOTSPUR,"To join with Mortimer, ha?"
623,Henry IV,48,1.3.292,EARL OF WORCESTER,And so they shall.
624,Henry IV,49,1.3.293,HOTSPUR,"In faith, it is exceedingly well aim'd."
625,Henry IV,50,1.3.294,EARL OF WORCESTER,"And 'tis no little reason bids us speed,"
626,Henry IV,50,1.3.295,EARL OF WORCESTER,"To save our heads by raising of a head,"
627,Henry IV,50,1.3.296,EARL OF WORCESTER,"For, bear ourselves as even as we can,"
628,Henry IV,50,1.3.297,EARL OF WORCESTER,"The king will always think him in our debt,"
629,Henry IV,50,1.3.298,EARL OF WORCESTER,"And think we think ourselves unsatisfied,"
630,Henry IV,50,1.3.299,EARL OF WORCESTER,Till he hath found a time to pay us home:
631,Henry IV,50,1.3.300,EARL OF WORCESTER,And see already how he doth begin
632,Henry IV,50,1.3.301,EARL OF WORCESTER,To make us strangers to his looks of love.
633,Henry IV,51,1.3.302,HOTSPUR,"He does, he does: we'll be revenged on him."
634,Henry IV,52,1.3.303,EARL OF WORCESTER,"Cousin, farewell: no further go in this"
635,Henry IV,52,1.3.304,EARL OF WORCESTER,Than I by letters shall direct your course.
636,Henry IV,52,1.3.305,EARL OF WORCESTER,"When time is ripe, which will be suddenly,"
637,Henry IV,52,1.3.306,EARL OF WORCESTER,"I'll steal to Glendower and Lord Mortimer,"
638,Henry IV,52,1.3.307,EARL OF WORCESTER,"Where you and Douglas and our powers at once,"
639,Henry IV,52,1.3.308,EARL OF WORCESTER,"As I will fashion it, shall happily meet,"
640,Henry IV,52,1.3.309,EARL OF WORCESTER,"To bear our fortunes in our own strong arms,"
641,Henry IV,52,1.3.310,EARL OF WORCESTER,Which now we hold at much uncertainty.
642,Henry IV,53,1.3.311,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Farewell, good brother: we shall thrive, I trust."
643,Henry IV,54,1.3.312,HOTSPUR,"Uncle, Adieu: O, let the hours be short"
644,Henry IV,54,1.3.313,HOTSPUR,Till fields and blows and groans applaud our sport!
645,Henry IV,54,,HOTSPUR,Exeunt
646,Henry IV,54,,HOTSPUR,ACT II
647,Henry IV,54,,HOTSPUR,SCENE I. Rochester. An inn yard.
648,Henry IV,54,,HOTSPUR,Enter a Carrier with a lantern in his hand
649,Henry IV,1,2.1.1,First Carrier,"Heigh-ho! an it be not four by the day, I'll be"
650,Henry IV,1,2.1.2,First Carrier,"hanged: Charles' wain is over the new chimney, and"
651,Henry IV,1,2.1.3,First Carrier,"yet our horse not packed. What, ostler!"
652,Henry IV,2,2.1.4,Ostler,"[Within]   Anon, anon."
653,Henry IV,3,2.1.5,First Carrier,"I prithee, Tom, beat Cut's saddle, put a few flocks"
654,Henry IV,3,2.1.6,First Carrier,"in the point, poor jade, is wrung in the withers out"
655,Henry IV,3,2.1.7,First Carrier,of all cess.
656,Henry IV,3,,First Carrier,Enter another Carrier
657,Henry IV,4,2.1.8,Second Carrier,"Peas and beans are as dank here as a dog, and that"
658,Henry IV,4,2.1.9,Second Carrier,is the next way to give poor jades the bots: this
659,Henry IV,4,2.1.10,Second Carrier,house is turned upside down since Robin Ostler died.
660,Henry IV,5,2.1.11,First Carrier,"Poor fellow, never joyed since the price of oats"
661,Henry IV,5,2.1.12,First Carrier,"rose, it was the death of him."
662,Henry IV,6,2.1.13,Second Carrier,I think this be the most villanous house in all
663,Henry IV,6,2.1.14,Second Carrier,London road for fleas: I am stung like a tench.
664,Henry IV,7,2.1.15,First Carrier,"Like a tench! by the mass, there is ne'er a king"
665,Henry IV,7,2.1.16,First Carrier,christen could be better bit than I have been since
666,Henry IV,7,2.1.17,First Carrier,the first cock.
667,Henry IV,8,2.1.18,Second Carrier,"Why, they will allow us ne'er a jordan, and then we"
668,Henry IV,8,2.1.19,Second Carrier,"leak in your chimney, and your chamber-lie breeds"
669,Henry IV,8,2.1.20,Second Carrier,fleas like a loach.
670,Henry IV,9,2.1.21,First Carrier,"What, ostler! come away and be hanged!"
671,Henry IV,10,2.1.22,Second Carrier,"I have a gammon of bacon and two razors of ginger,"
672,Henry IV,10,2.1.23,Second Carrier,to be delivered as far as Charing-cross.
673,Henry IV,11,2.1.24,First Carrier,God's body! the turkeys in my pannier are quite
674,Henry IV,11,2.1.25,First Carrier,"starved. What, ostler! A plague on thee! hast thou"
675,Henry IV,11,2.1.26,First Carrier,never an eye in thy head? canst not hear? An
676,Henry IV,11,2.1.27,First Carrier,"'twere not as good deed as drink, to break the pate"
677,Henry IV,11,2.1.28,First Carrier,"on thee, I am a very villain. Come, and be hanged!"
678,Henry IV,11,2.1.29,First Carrier,hast thou no faith in thee?
679,Henry IV,11,,First Carrier,Enter GADSHILL
680,Henry IV,12,2.1.30,GADSHILL,"Good morrow, carriers. What's o'clock?"
681,Henry IV,13,2.1.31,First Carrier,I think it be two o'clock.
682,Henry IV,14,2.1.32,GADSHILL,"I pray thee lend me thy lantern, to see my gelding"
683,Henry IV,14,2.1.33,GADSHILL,in the stable.
684,Henry IV,15,2.1.34,First Carrier,"Nay, by God, soft, I know a trick worth two of that, i' faith."
685,Henry IV,16,2.1.35,GADSHILL,"I pray thee, lend me thine."
686,Henry IV,17,2.1.36,Second Carrier,"Ay, when? can'st tell? Lend me thy lantern, quoth"
687,Henry IV,17,2.1.37,Second Carrier,"he? marry, I'll see thee hanged first."
688,Henry IV,18,2.1.38,GADSHILL,"Sirrah carrier, what time do you mean to come to London?"
689,Henry IV,19,2.1.39,Second Carrier,"Time enough to go to bed with a candle, I warrant"
690,Henry IV,19,2.1.40,Second Carrier,"thee. Come, neighbour Mugs, we'll call up the"
691,Henry IV,19,2.1.41,Second Carrier,"gentleman: they will along with company, for they"
692,Henry IV,19,2.1.42,Second Carrier,have great charge.
693,Henry IV,19,,Second Carrier,Exeunt carriers
694,Henry IV,20,2.1.43,GADSHILL,"What, ho! chamberlain!"
695,Henry IV,21,2.1.44,Chamberlain,"[Within]  At hand, quoth pick-purse."
696,Henry IV,22,2.1.45,GADSHILL,"That's even as fair as--at hand, quoth the"
697,Henry IV,22,2.1.46,GADSHILL,"chamberlain, for thou variest no more from picking"
698,Henry IV,22,2.1.47,GADSHILL,"of purses than giving direction doth from labouring,"
699,Henry IV,22,2.1.48,GADSHILL,thou layest the plot how.
700,Henry IV,22,,GADSHILL,Enter Chamberlain
701,Henry IV,23,2.1.49,Chamberlain,"Good morrow, Master Gadshill. It holds current that"
702,Henry IV,23,2.1.50,Chamberlain,I told you yesternight: there's a franklin in the
703,Henry IV,23,2.1.51,Chamberlain,wild of Kent hath brought three hundred marks with
704,Henry IV,23,2.1.52,Chamberlain,him in gold: I heard him tell it to one of his

756,Henry IV,6,2.2.8,PRINCE HENRY,He is walked up to the top of the hill: I'll go seek him.
757,Henry IV,7,2.2.9,FALSTAFF,I am accursed to rob in that thief's company: the
758,Henry IV,7,2.2.10,FALSTAFF,"rascal hath removed my horse, and tied him I know"
759,Henry IV,7,2.2.11,FALSTAFF,not where. If I travel but four foot by the squier

761,Henry IV,7,2.2.13,FALSTAFF,"not but to die a fair death for all this, if I"

766,Henry IV,7,2.2.18,FALSTAFF,"medicines to make me love him, I'll be hanged, it"
767,Henry IV,7,2.2.19,FALSTAFF,could not be else: I have drunk medicines. Poins!

841,Henry IV,39,2.2.87,PRINCE HENRY,"and I rob the thieves and go merrily to London, it"
842,Henry IV,39,2.2.88,PRINCE HENRY,"would be argument for a week, laughter for a month"
843,Henry IV,39,2.2.89,PRINCE HENRY,and a good jest for ever.
844,Henry IV,40,2.2.90,POINS,"Stand close, I hear them coming."

846,Henry IV,41,2.2.91,FALSTAFF,"Come, my masters, let us share, and then to  horse"
847,Henry IV,41,2.2.92,FALSTAFF,before day. An the Prince and Poins be not two

849,Henry IV,41,2.2.94,FALSTAFF,no more valour in that Poins than in a wild-duck.
850,Henry IV,42,2.2.95,PRINCE HENRY,Your money!

857,Henry IV,44,2.2.101,PRINCE HENRY,"Away, good Ned. Falstaff sweats to death,"

908,Henry IV,2,2.3.44,LADY PERCY,And start so often when thou sit'st alone?
909,Henry IV,2,2.3.45,LADY PERCY,"Why hast thou lost the fresh blood in thy cheeks,"
910,Henry IV,2,2.3.46,LADY PERCY,And given my treasures and my rights of thee
911,Henry IV,2,2.3.47,LADY PERCY,To thick-eyed musing and cursed melancholy?
912,Henry IV,2,2.3.48,LADY PERCY,"In thy faint slumbers I by thee have watch'd,"

1172,Henry IV,64,2.4.169,GADSHILL,And bound them.
1173,Henry IV,65,2.4.170,PETO,"No, no, they were not bound."
1174,Henry IV,66,2.4.171,FALSTAFF,"You rogue, they were bound, every man of them, or I"
1175,Henry IV,66,2.4.172,FALSTAFF,"am a Jew else, an Ebrew Jew."
1176,Henry IV,67,2.4.173,GADSHILL,"As we were sharing, some six or seven fresh men set upon us--"
1177,Henry IV,68,2.4.174,FALSTAFF,"And unbound the rest, and then come in the other."
1178,Henry IV,69,2.4.175,PRINCE HENRY,"What, fought you with them all?"
1179,Henry IV,70,2.4.176,FALSTAFF,"All! I know not what you call all, but if I fought"
1180,Henry IV,70,2.4.177,FALSTAFF,"not with fifty of them, I am a bunch of radish: if"
1181,Henry IV,70,2.4.178,FALSTAFF,there were not two or three and fifty upon poor old
1182,Henry IV,70,2.4.179,FALSTAFF,"Jack, then am I no two-legged creature."
1183,Henry IV,71,2.4.180,PRINCE HENRY,Pray God you have not murdered some of them.
1184,Henry IV,72,2.4.181,FALSTAFF,"Nay, that's past praying for: I have peppered two"
1185,Henry IV,72,2.4.182,FALSTAFF,"of them, two I am sure I have paid, two rogues"
1186,Henry IV,72,2.4.183,FALSTAFF,"in buckram suits. I tell thee what, Hal, if I tell"
1187,Henry IV,72,2.4.184,FALSTAFF,"thee a lie, spit in my face, call me horse. Thou"
1188,Henry IV,72,2.4.185,FALSTAFF,"knowest my old ward, here I lay and thus I bore my"
1189,Henry IV,72,2.4.186,FALSTAFF,point. Four rogues in buckram let drive at me--
1190,Henry IV,73,2.4.187,PRINCE HENRY,"What, four? thou saidst but two even now."
1191,Henry IV,74,2.4.188,FALSTAFF,"Four, Hal, I told thee four."
1192,Henry IV,75,2.4.189,POINS,"Ay, ay, he said four."
1193,Henry IV,76,2.4.190,FALSTAFF,"These four came all a-front, and mainly thrust at"
1194,Henry IV,76,2.4.191,FALSTAFF,me. I made me no more ado but took all their seven
1195,Henry IV,76,2.4.192,FALSTAFF,"points in my target, thus."
1196,Henry IV,77,2.4.193,PRINCE HENRY,"Seven? why, there were but four even now."
1197,Henry IV,78,2.4.194,FALSTAFF,In buckram?
1198,Henry IV,79,2.4.195,POINS,"Ay, four, in buckram suits."
1199,Henry IV,80,2.4.196,FALSTAFF,"Seven, by these hilts, or I am a villain else."
1200,Henry IV,81,2.4.197,PRINCE HENRY,"Prithee, let him alone, we shall have more anon."
1201,Henry IV,82,2.4.198,FALSTAFF,"Dost thou hear me, Hal?"
1202,Henry IV,83,2.4.199,PRINCE HENRY,"Ay, and mark thee too, Jack."
1203,Henry IV,84,2.4.200,FALSTAFF,"Do so, for it is worth the listening to. These nine"
1204,Henry IV,84,2.4.201,FALSTAFF,in buckram that I told thee of--
1205,Henry IV,85,2.4.202,PRINCE HENRY,"So, two more already."
1206,Henry IV,86,2.4.203,FALSTAFF,"Their points being broken,--"
1207,Henry IV,87,2.4.204,POINS,Down fell their hose.
1208,Henry IV,88,2.4.205,FALSTAFF,"Began to give me ground: but I followed me close,"
1209,Henry IV,88,2.4.206,FALSTAFF,"came in foot and hand, and with a thought seven of"
1210,Henry IV,88,2.4.207,FALSTAFF,the eleven I paid.
1211,Henry IV,89,2.4.208,PRINCE HENRY,O monstrous! eleven buckram men grown out of two!
1212,Henry IV,90,2.4.209,FALSTAFF,"But, as the devil would have it, three misbegotten"
1213,Henry IV,90,2.4.210,FALSTAFF,knaves in Kendal green came at my back and let drive
1214,Henry IV,90,2.4.211,FALSTAFF,"at me, for it was so dark, Hal, that thou couldst"
1215,Henry IV,90,2.4.212,FALSTAFF,not see thy hand.
1216,Henry IV,91,2.4.213,PRINCE HENRY,"These lies are like their father that begets them,"
1217,Henry IV,91,2.4.214,PRINCE HENRY,"gross as a mountain, open, palpable. Why, thou"
1218,Henry IV,91,2.4.215,PRINCE HENRY,"clay-brained guts, thou knotty-pated fool, thou"
1219,Henry IV,91,2.4.216,PRINCE HENRY,"whoreson, obscene, grease tallow-catch,--"
1220,Henry IV,92,2.4.217,FALSTAFF,"What, art thou mad? art thou mad? is not the truth"
1221,Henry IV,92,2.4.218,FALSTAFF,the truth?
1222,Henry IV,93,2.4.219,PRINCE HENRY,"Why, how couldst thou know these men in Kendal"
1223,Henry IV,93,2.4.220,PRINCE HENRY,"green, when it was so dark thou couldst not see thy"
1224,Henry IV,93,2.4.221,PRINCE HENRY,"hand? come, tell us your reason: what sayest thou to this?"
1225,Henry IV,94,2.4.222,POINS,"Come, your reason, Jack, your reason."
1226,Henry IV,95,2.4.223,FALSTAFF,"What, upon compulsion? 'Zounds, an I were at the"
1227,Henry IV,95,2.4.224,FALSTAFF,"strappado, or all the racks in the world, I would"
1228,Henry IV,95,2.4.225,FALSTAFF,not tell you on compulsion. Give you a reason on
1229,Henry IV,95,2.4.226,FALSTAFF,compulsion! If reasons were as plentiful as
1230,Henry IV,95,2.4.227,FALSTAFF,"blackberries, I would give no man a reason upon"
1231,Henry IV,95,2.4.228,FALSTAFF,"compulsion, I."
1232,Henry IV,96,2.4.229,PRINCE HENRY,"I'll be no longer guilty of this sin, this sanguine"
1233,Henry IV,96,2.4.230,PRINCE HENRY,"coward, this bed-presser, this horseback-breaker,"
1234,Henry IV,96,2.4.231,PRINCE HENRY,"this huge hill of flesh,--"
1235,Henry IV,97,2.4.232,FALSTAFF,"'Sblood, you starveling, you elf-skin, you dried"

1237,Henry IV,97,2.4.234,FALSTAFF,for breath to utter what is like thee! you
1238,Henry IV,97,2.4.235,FALSTAFF,"tailor's-yard, you sheath, you bowcase, you vile"
1239,Henry IV,97,2.4.236,FALSTAFF,"standing-tuck,--"
1240,Henry IV,98,2.4.237,PRINCE HENRY,"Well, breathe awhile, and then to it again: and"
1241,Henry IV,98,2.4.238,PRINCE HENRY,"when thou hast tired thyself in base comparisons,"
1242,Henry IV,98,2.4.239,PRINCE HENRY,hear me speak but this.
1243,Henry IV,99,2.4.240,POINS,"Mark, Jack."
1244,Henry IV,100,2.4.241,PRINCE HENRY,"We two saw you four set on four and bound them, and"
1245,Henry IV,100,2.4.242,PRINCE HENRY,"were masters of their wealth. Mark now, how a plain"
1246,Henry IV,100,2.4.243,PRINCE HENRY,tale shall put you down. Then did we two set on you
1247,Henry IV,100,2.4.244,PRINCE HENRY,"four, and, with a word, out-faced you from your"
1248,Henry IV,100,2.4.245,PRINCE HENRY,"prize, and have it, yea, and can show it you here in"
1249,Henry IV,100,2.4.246,PRINCE HENRY,"the house: and, Falstaff, you carried your guts"
1250,Henry IV,100,2.4.247,PRINCE HENRY,"away as nimbly, with as quick dexterity, and roared"
1251,Henry IV,100,2.4.248,PRINCE HENRY,"for mercy and still run and roared, as ever I heard"
1252,Henry IV,100,2.4.249,PRINCE HENRY,"bull-calf. What a slave art thou, to hack thy sword"
1253,Henry IV,100,2.4.250,PRINCE HENRY,"as thou hast done, and then say it was in fight!"
1254,Henry IV,100,2.4.251,PRINCE HENRY,"What trick, what device, what starting-hole, canst"
1255,Henry IV,100,2.4.252,PRINCE HENRY,thou now find out to hide thee from this open and
1256,Henry IV,100,2.4.253,PRINCE HENRY,apparent shame?
1257,Henry IV,101,2.4.254,POINS,"Come, let's hear, Jack, what trick hast thou now?"
1258,Henry IV,102,2.4.255,FALSTAFF,"By the Lord, I knew ye as well as he that made ye."
1259,Henry IV,102,2.4.256,FALSTAFF,"Why, hear you, my masters: was it for me to kill the"
1260,Henry IV,102,2.4.257,FALSTAFF,heir-apparent? should I turn upon the true prince?
1261,Henry IV,102,2.4.258,FALSTAFF,"why, thou knowest I am as valiant as Hercules: but"
1262,Henry IV,102,2.4.259,FALSTAFF,"beware instinct, the lion will not touch the true"
1263,Henry IV,102,2.4.260,FALSTAFF,"prince. Instinct is a great matter, I was now a"
1264,Henry IV,102,2.4.261,FALSTAFF,coward on instinct. I shall think the better of
1265,Henry IV,102,2.4.262,FALSTAFF,"myself and thee during my life, I for a valiant"
1266,Henry IV,102,2.4.263,FALSTAFF,"lion, and thou for a true prince. But, by the Lord,"
1267,Henry IV,102,2.4.264,FALSTAFF,"lads, I am glad you have the money. Hostess, clap"
1268,Henry IV,102,2.4.265,FALSTAFF,"to the doors: watch to-night, pray to-morrow."
1269,Henry IV,102,2.4.266,FALSTAFF,"Gallants, lads, boys, hearts of gold, all the titles"
1270,Henry IV,102,2.4.267,FALSTAFF,"of good fellowship come to you! What, shall we be"
1271,Henry IV,102,2.4.268,FALSTAFF,merry? shall we have a play extempore?
1272,Henry IV,103,2.4.269,PRINCE HENRY,"Content, and the argument shall be thy running away."
1273,Henry IV,104,2.4.270,FALSTAFF,"Ah, no more of that, Hal, an thou lovest me!"
1274,Henry IV,104,,FALSTAFF,Enter Hostess
1275,Henry IV,105,2.4.271,Hostess,"O Jesu, my lord the prince!"
1276,Henry IV,106,2.4.272,PRINCE HENRY,"How now, my lady the hostess! what sayest thou to"
1277,Henry IV,106,2.4.273,PRINCE HENRY,me?
1278,Henry IV,107,2.4.274,Hostess,"Marry, my lord, there is a nobleman of the court at"
1279,Henry IV,107,2.4.275,Hostess,door would speak with you: he says he comes from
1280,Henry IV,107,2.4.276,Hostess,your father.
1281,Henry IV,108,2.4.277,PRINCE HENRY,"Give him as much as will make him a royal man, and"
1282,Henry IV,108,2.4.278,PRINCE HENRY,send him back again to my mother.
1283,Henry IV,109,2.4.279,FALSTAFF,What manner of man is he?
1284,Henry IV,110,2.4.280,Hostess,An old man.
1285,Henry IV,111,2.4.281,FALSTAFF,What doth gravity out of his bed at midnight? Shall
1286,Henry IV,111,2.4.282,FALSTAFF,I give him his answer?
1287,Henry IV,112,2.4.283,PRINCE HENRY,"Prithee, do, Jack."
1288,Henry IV,113,2.4.284,FALSTAFF,"'Faith, and I'll send him packing."
1289,Henry IV,113,,FALSTAFF,Exit FALSTAFF
1290,Henry IV,114,2.4.285,PRINCE HENRY,"Now, sirs: by'r lady, you fought fair, so did you,"
1291,Henry IV,114,2.4.286,PRINCE HENRY,"Peto, so did you, Bardolph: you are lions too, you"
1292,Henry IV,114,2.4.287,PRINCE HENRY,"ran away upon instinct, you will not touch the true"
1293,Henry IV,114,2.4.288,PRINCE HENRY,"prince, no, fie!"
1294,Henry IV,115,2.4.289,BARDOLPH,"'Faith, I ran when I saw others run."
1295,Henry IV,116,2.4.290,PRINCE HENRY,"'Faith, tell me now in earnest, how came Falstaff's"
1296,Henry IV,116,2.4.291,PRINCE HENRY,sword so hacked?
1297,Henry IV,117,2.4.292,PETO,"Why, he hacked it with his dagger, and said he would"
1298,Henry IV,117,2.4.293,PETO,swear truth out of England but he would make you
1299,Henry IV,117,2.4.294,PETO,"believe it was done in fight, and persuaded us to do the like."
1300,Henry IV,118,2.4.295,BARDOLPH,"Yea, and to tickle our noses with spear-grass to"
1301,Henry IV,118,2.4.296,BARDOLPH,"make them bleed, and then to beslubber our garments"
1302,Henry IV,118,2.4.297,BARDOLPH,with it and swear it was the blood of true men. I
1303,Henry IV,118,2.4.298,BARDOLPH,"did that I did not this seven year before, I blushed"
1304,Henry IV,118,2.4.299,BARDOLPH,to hear his monstrous devices.
1305,Henry IV,119,2.4.300,PRINCE HENRY,"O villain, thou stolest a cup of sack eighteen years"
1306,Henry IV,119,2.4.301,PRINCE HENRY,"ago, and wert taken with the manner, and ever since"
1307,Henry IV,119,2.4.302,PRINCE HENRY,thou hast blushed extempore. Thou hadst fire and
1308,Henry IV,119,2.4.303,PRINCE HENRY,"sword on thy side, and yet thou rannest away: what"
1309,Henry IV,119,2.4.304,PRINCE HENRY,instinct hadst thou for it?
1310,Henry IV,120,2.4.305,BARDOLPH,"My lord, do you see these meteors? do you behold"
1311,Henry IV,120,2.4.306,BARDOLPH,these exhalations?
1312,Henry IV,121,2.4.307,PRINCE HENRY,I do.
1313,Henry IV,122,2.4.308,BARDOLPH,What think you they portend?
1314,Henry IV,123,2.4.309,PRINCE HENRY,Hot livers and cold purses.
1315,Henry IV,124,2.4.310,BARDOLPH,"Choler, my lord, if rightly taken."
1316,Henry IV,125,2.4.311,PRINCE HENRY,"No, if rightly taken, halter."
1317,Henry IV,125,,PRINCE HENRY,Re-enter FALSTAFF
1318,Henry IV,125,2.4.312,PRINCE HENRY,"Here comes lean Jack, here comes bare-bone."
1319,Henry IV,125,2.4.313,PRINCE HENRY,"How now, my sweet creature of bombast!"
1320,Henry IV,125,2.4.314,PRINCE HENRY,"How long is't ago, Jack, since thou sawest thine own knee?"
1321,Henry IV,126,2.4.315,FALSTAFF,"My own knee! when I was about thy years, Hal, I was"
1322,Henry IV,126,2.4.316,FALSTAFF,"not an eagle's talon in the waist, I could have"
1323,Henry IV,126,2.4.317,FALSTAFF,crept into any alderman's thumb-ring: a plague of
1324,Henry IV,126,2.4.318,FALSTAFF,sighing and grief! it blows a man up like a
1325,Henry IV,126,2.4.319,FALSTAFF,bladder. There's villanous news abroad: here was
1326,Henry IV,126,2.4.320,FALSTAFF,"Sir John Bracy from your father, you must to the"
1327,Henry IV,126,2.4.321,FALSTAFF,court in the morning. That same mad fellow of the
1328,Henry IV,126,2.4.322,FALSTAFF,"north, Percy, and he of Wales, that gave Amamon the"
1329,Henry IV,126,2.4.323,FALSTAFF,bastinado and made Lucifer cuckold and swore the
1330,Henry IV,126,2.4.324,FALSTAFF,devil his true liegeman upon the cross of a Welsh
1331,Henry IV,126,2.4.325,FALSTAFF,hook--what a plague call you him?
1332,Henry IV,127,2.4.326,POINS,"O, Glendower."
1333,Henry IV,128,2.4.327,FALSTAFF,"Owen, Owen, the same, and his son-in-law Mortimer,"
1334,Henry IV,128,2.4.328,FALSTAFF,"and old Northumberland, and that sprightly Scot of"
1335,Henry IV,128,2.4.329,FALSTAFF,"Scots, Douglas, that runs o' horseback up a hill"
1336,Henry IV,128,2.4.330,FALSTAFF,"perpendicular,--"
1337,Henry IV,129,2.4.331,PRINCE HENRY,He that rides at high speed and with his pistol
1338,Henry IV,129,2.4.332,PRINCE HENRY,kills a sparrow flying.
1339,Henry IV,130,2.4.333,FALSTAFF,You have hit it.
1340,Henry IV,131,2.4.334,PRINCE HENRY,So did he never the sparrow.
1341,Henry IV,132,2.4.335,FALSTAFF,"Well, that rascal hath good mettle in him, he will not run."
1342,Henry IV,133,2.4.336,PRINCE HENRY,"Why, what a rascal art thou then, to praise him so"
1343,Henry IV,133,2.4.337,PRINCE HENRY,for running!
1344,Henry IV,134,2.4.338,FALSTAFF,"O' horseback, ye cuckoo, but afoot he will not budge a foot."
1345,Henry IV,135,2.4.339,PRINCE HENRY,"Yes, Jack, upon instinct."
1346,Henry IV,136,2.4.340,FALSTAFF,"I grant ye, upon instinct. Well, he is there too,"
1347,Henry IV,136,2.4.341,FALSTAFF,"and one Mordake, and a thousand blue-caps more:"
1348,Henry IV,136,2.4.342,FALSTAFF,"Worcester is stolen away to-night, thy father's"
1349,Henry IV,136,2.4.343,FALSTAFF,beard is turned white with the news: you may buy
1350,Henry IV,136,2.4.344,FALSTAFF,land now as cheap as stinking mackerel.
1351,Henry IV,137,2.4.345,PRINCE HENRY,"Why, then, it is like, if there come a hot June and"
1352,Henry IV,137,2.4.346,PRINCE HENRY,"this civil buffeting hold, we shall buy maidenheads"
1353,Henry IV,137,2.4.347,PRINCE HENRY,"as they buy hob-nails, by the hundreds."
1354,Henry IV,138,2.4.348,FALSTAFF,"By the mass, lad, thou sayest true, it is like we"
1355,Henry IV,138,2.4.349,FALSTAFF,"shall have good trading that way. But tell me, Hal,"
1356,Henry IV,138,2.4.350,FALSTAFF,art not thou horrible afeard? thou being
1357,Henry IV,138,2.4.351,FALSTAFF,"heir-apparent, could the world pick thee out three"
1358,Henry IV,138,2.4.352,FALSTAFF,"such enemies again as that fiend Douglas, that"
1359,Henry IV,138,2.4.353,FALSTAFF,"spirit Percy, and that devil Glendower? Art thou"
1360,Henry IV,138,2.4.354,FALSTAFF,not horribly afraid? doth not thy blood thrill at
1361,Henry IV,138,2.4.355,FALSTAFF,it?
1362,Henry IV,139,2.4.356,PRINCE HENRY,"Not a whit, i' faith, I lack some of thy instinct."
1363,Henry IV,140,2.4.357,FALSTAFF,"Well, thou wert be horribly chid tomorrow when thou"
1364,Henry IV,140,2.4.358,FALSTAFF,"comest to thy father: if thou love me, practise an answer."
1365,Henry IV,141,2.4.359,PRINCE HENRY,"Do thou stand for my father, and examine me upon the"

1367,Henry IV,142,2.4.361,FALSTAFF,"Shall I? content: this chair shall be my state,"
1368,Henry IV,142,2.4.362,FALSTAFF,"this dagger my sceptre, and this cushion my crown."
1369,Henry IV,143,2.4.363,PRINCE HENRY,"Thy state is taken for a joined-stool, thy golden"
1370,Henry IV,143,2.4.364,PRINCE HENRY,"sceptre for a leaden dagger, and thy precious rich"
1371,Henry IV,143,2.4.365,PRINCE HENRY,crown for a pitiful bald crown!
1372,Henry IV,144,2.4.366,FALSTAFF,"Well, an the fire of grace be not quite out of thee,"
1373,Henry IV,144,2.4.367,FALSTAFF,now shalt thou be moved. Give me a cup of sack to
1374,Henry IV,144,2.4.368,FALSTAFF,"make my eyes look red, that it may be thought I have"
1375,Henry IV,144,2.4.369,FALSTAFF,"wept, for I must speak in passion, and I will do it"
1376,Henry IV,144,2.4.370,FALSTAFF,in King Cambyses' vein.
1377,Henry IV,145,2.4.371,PRINCE HENRY,"Well, here is my leg."
1378,Henry IV,146,2.4.372,FALSTAFF,"And here is my speech. Stand aside, nobility."
1379,Henry IV,147,2.4.373,Hostess,"O Jesu, this is excellent sport, i' faith!"
1380,Henry IV,148,2.4.374,FALSTAFF,"Weep not, sweet queen, for trickling tears are vain."
1381,Henry IV,149,2.4.375,Hostess,"O, the father, how he holds his countenance!"
1382,Henry IV,150,2.4.376,FALSTAFF,"For God's sake, lords, convey my tristful queen,"
1383,Henry IV,150,2.4.377,FALSTAFF,For tears do stop the flood-gates of her eyes.
1384,Henry IV,151,2.4.378,Hostess,"O Jesu, he doth it as like one of these harlotry"
1385,Henry IV,151,2.4.379,Hostess,players as ever I see!
1386,Henry IV,152,2.4.380,FALSTAFF,"Peace, good pint-pot, peace, good tickle-brain."
1387,Henry IV,152,2.4.381,FALSTAFF,"Harry, I do not only marvel where thou spendest thy"
1388,Henry IV,152,2.4.382,FALSTAFF,"time, but also how thou art accompanied: for though"
1389,Henry IV,152,2.4.383,FALSTAFF,"the camomile, the more it is trodden on the faster"
1390,Henry IV,152,2.4.384,FALSTAFF,"it grows, yet youth, the more it is wasted the"
1391,Henry IV,152,2.4.385,FALSTAFF,"sooner it wears. That thou art my son, I have"
1392,Henry IV,152,2.4.386,FALSTAFF,"partly thy mother's word, partly my own opinion,"
1393,Henry IV,152,2.4.387,FALSTAFF,but chiefly a villanous trick of thine eye and a
1394,Henry IV,152,2.4.388,FALSTAFF,"foolish-hanging of thy nether lip, that doth warrant"
1395,Henry IV,152,2.4.389,FALSTAFF,"me. If then thou be son to me, here lies the point,"
1396,Henry IV,152,2.4.390,FALSTAFF,"why, being son to me, art thou so pointed at? Shall"
1397,Henry IV,152,2.4.391,FALSTAFF,the blessed sun of heaven prove a micher and eat
1398,Henry IV,152,2.4.392,FALSTAFF,blackberries? a question not to be asked. Shall
1399,Henry IV,152,2.4.393,FALSTAFF,the sun of England prove a thief and take purses? a
1400,Henry IV,152,2.4.394,FALSTAFF,"question to be asked. There is a thing, Harry,"
1401,Henry IV,152,2.4.395,FALSTAFF,which thou hast often heard of and it is known to
1402,Henry IV,152,2.4.396,FALSTAFF,"many in our land by the name of pitch: this pitch,"
1403,Henry IV,152,2.4.397,FALSTAFF,"as ancient writers do report, doth defile, so doth"
1404,Henry IV,152,2.4.398,FALSTAFF,"the company thou keepest: for, Harry, now I do not"
1405,Henry IV,152,2.4.399,FALSTAFF,"speak to thee in drink but in tears, not in"
1406,Henry IV,152,2.4.400,FALSTAFF,"pleasure but in passion, not in words only, but in"
1407,Henry IV,152,2.4.401,FALSTAFF,woes also: and yet there is a virtuous man whom I
1408,Henry IV,152,2.4.402,FALSTAFF,"have often noted in thy company, but I know not his name."
1409,Henry IV,153,2.4.403,PRINCE HENRY,"What manner of man, an it like your majesty?"
1410,Henry IV,154,2.4.404,FALSTAFF,"A goodly portly man, i' faith, and a corpulent, of a"
1411,Henry IV,154,2.4.405,FALSTAFF,"cheerful look, a pleasing eye and a most noble"
1412,Henry IV,154,2.4.406,FALSTAFF,"carriage, and, as I think, his age some fifty, or,"
1413,Henry IV,154,2.4.407,FALSTAFF,"by'r lady, inclining to three score, and now I"
1414,Henry IV,154,2.4.408,FALSTAFF,"remember me, his name is Falstaff: if that man"
1415,Henry IV,154,2.4.409,FALSTAFF,"should be lewdly given, he deceiveth me, for, Harry,"
1416,Henry IV,154,2.4.410,FALSTAFF,I see virtue in his looks. If then the tree may be
1417,Henry IV,154,2.4.411,FALSTAFF,"known by the fruit, as the fruit by the tree, then,"
1418,Henry IV,154,2.4.412,FALSTAFF,"peremptorily I speak it, there is virtue in that"
1419,Henry IV,154,2.4.413,FALSTAFF,"Falstaff: him keep with, the rest banish. And tell"
1420,Henry IV,154,2.4.414,FALSTAFF,"me now, thou naughty varlet, tell me, where hast"
1421,Henry IV,154,2.4.415,FALSTAFF,thou been this month?
1422,Henry IV,155,2.4.416,PRINCE HENRY,"Dost thou speak like a king? Do thou stand for me,"
1423,Henry IV,155,2.4.417,PRINCE HENRY,and I'll play my father.
1424,Henry IV,156,2.4.418,FALSTAFF,"Depose me? if thou dost it half so gravely, so"
1425,Henry IV,156,2.4.419,FALSTAFF,"majestically, both in word and matter, hang me up by"
1426,Henry IV,156,2.4.420,FALSTAFF,the heels for a rabbit-sucker or a poulter's hare.
1427,Henry IV,157,2.4.421,PRINCE HENRY,"Well, here I am set."
1428,Henry IV,158,2.4.422,FALSTAFF,"And here I stand: judge, my masters."
1429,Henry IV,159,2.4.423,PRINCE HENRY,"Now, Harry, whence come you?"
1430,Henry IV,160,2.4.424,FALSTAFF,"My noble lord, from Eastcheap."
1431,Henry IV,161,2.4.425,PRINCE HENRY,The complaints I hear of thee are grievous.
1432,Henry IV,162,2.4.426,FALSTAFF,"'Sblood, my lord, they are false: nay, I'll tickle"
1433,Henry IV,162,2.4.427,FALSTAFF,"ye for a young prince, i' faith."
1434,Henry IV,163,2.4.428,PRINCE HENRY,"Swearest thou, ungracious boy? henceforth ne'er look"
1435,Henry IV,163,2.4.429,PRINCE HENRY,on me. Thou art violently carried away from grace:
1436,Henry IV,163,2.4.430,PRINCE HENRY,there is a devil haunts thee in the likeness of an
1437,Henry IV,163,2.4.431,PRINCE HENRY,"old fat man, a tun of man is thy companion. Why"
1438,Henry IV,163,2.4.432,PRINCE HENRY,"dost thou converse with that trunk of humours, that"
1439,Henry IV,163,2.4.433,PRINCE HENRY,"bolting-hutch of beastliness, that swollen parcel"
1440,Henry IV,163,2.4.434,PRINCE HENRY,"of dropsies, that huge bombard of sack, that stuffed"
1441,Henry IV,163,2.4.435,PRINCE HENRY,"cloak-bag of guts, that roasted Manningtree ox with"
1442,Henry IV,163,2.4.436,PRINCE HENRY,"the pudding in his belly, that reverend vice, that"
1443,Henry IV,163,2.4.437,PRINCE HENRY,"grey iniquity, that father ruffian, that vanity in"
1444,Henry IV,163,2.4.438,PRINCE HENRY,"years? Wherein is he good, but to taste sack and"
1445,Henry IV,163,2.4.439,PRINCE HENRY,"drink it? wherein neat and cleanly, but to carve a"
1446,Henry IV,163,2.4.440,PRINCE HENRY,"capon and eat it? wherein cunning, but in craft?"
1447,Henry IV,163,2.4.441,PRINCE HENRY,"wherein crafty, but in villany? wherein villanous,"
1448,Henry IV,163,2.4.442,PRINCE HENRY,"but in all things? wherein worthy, but in nothing?"
1449,Henry IV,164,2.4.443,FALSTAFF,I would your grace would take me with you: whom
1450,Henry IV,164,2.4.444,FALSTAFF,means your grace?
1451,Henry IV,165,2.4.445,PRINCE HENRY,"That villanous abominable misleader of youth,"
1452,Henry IV,165,2.4.446,PRINCE HENRY,"Falstaff, that old white-bearded Satan."
1453,Henry IV,166,2.4.447,FALSTAFF,"My lord, the man I know."
1454,Henry IV,167,2.4.448,PRINCE HENRY,I know thou dost.
1455,Henry IV,168,2.4.449,FALSTAFF,"But to say I know more harm in him than in myself,"
1456,Henry IV,168,2.4.450,FALSTAFF,"were to say more than I know. That he is old, the"
1457,Henry IV,168,2.4.451,FALSTAFF,"more the pity, his white hairs do witness it, but"
1458,Henry IV,168,2.4.452,FALSTAFF,"that he is, saving your reverence, a whoremaster,"
1459,Henry IV,168,2.4.453,FALSTAFF,"that I utterly deny. If sack and sugar be a fault,"
1460,Henry IV,168,2.4.454,FALSTAFF,God help the wicked! if to be old and merry be a
1461,Henry IV,168,2.4.455,FALSTAFF,"sin, then many an old host that I know is damned: if"
1462,Henry IV,168,2.4.456,FALSTAFF,"to be fat be to be hated, then Pharaoh's lean kine"
1463,Henry IV,168,2.4.457,FALSTAFF,"are to be loved. No, my good lord, banish Peto,"
1464,Henry IV,168,2.4.458,FALSTAFF,"banish Bardolph, banish Poins: but for sweet Jack"
1465,Henry IV,168,2.4.459,FALSTAFF,"Falstaff, kind Jack Falstaff, true Jack Falstaff,"
1466,Henry IV,168,2.4.460,FALSTAFF,"valiant Jack Falstaff, and therefore more valiant,"
1467,Henry IV,168,2.4.461,FALSTAFF,"being, as he is, old Jack Falstaff, banish not him"

1475,Henry IV,170,2.4.466,BARDOLPH,monstrous watch is at the door.
1476,Henry IV,171,2.4.467,FALSTAFF,"Out, ye rogue! Play out the play: I have much to"
1477,Henry IV,171,2.4.468,FALSTAFF,say in the behalf of that Falstaff.

1481,Henry IV,173,2.4.471,PRINCE HENRY,what's the matter?
1482,Henry IV,174,2.4.472,Hostess,The sheriff and all the watch are at the door: they
1483,Henry IV,174,2.4.473,Hostess,are come to search the house. Shall I let them in?
1484,Henry IV,175,2.4.474,FALSTAFF,"Dost thou hear, Hal? never call a true piece of"
1485,Henry IV,175,2.4.475,FALSTAFF,"gold a counterfeit: thou art essentially mad,"
1486,Henry IV,175,2.4.476,FALSTAFF,without seeming so.
1487,Henry IV,176,2.4.477,PRINCE HENRY,"And thou a natural coward, without instinct."
1488,Henry IV,177,2.4.478,FALSTAFF,"I deny your major: if you will deny the sheriff,"
1489,Henry IV,177,2.4.479,FALSTAFF,"so, if not, let him enter: if I become not a cart"
1490,Henry IV,177,2.4.480,FALSTAFF,"as well as another man, a plague on my bringing up!"
1491,Henry IV,177,2.4.481,FALSTAFF,I hope I shall as soon be strangled with a halter as another.
1492,Henry IV,178,2.4.482,PRINCE HENRY,"Go, hide thee behind the arras: the rest walk up"

1502,Henry IV,181,2.4.490,Sheriff,Hath follow'd certain men unto this house.
1503,Henry IV,182,2.4.491,PRINCE HENRY,What men?
1504,Henry IV,183,2.4.492,Sheriff,"One of them is well known, my gracious lord,"
1505,Henry IV,183,2.4.493,Sheriff,A gross fat man.
1506,Henry IV,184,2.4.494,Carrier,As fat as butter.
1507,Henry IV,185,2.4.495,PRINCE HENRY,"The man, I do assure you, is not here,"
1508,Henry IV,185,2.4.496,PRINCE HENRY,For I myself at this time have employ'd him.
1509,Henry IV,185,2.4.497,PRINCE HENRY,"And, sheriff, I will engage my word to thee"
1510,Henry IV,185,2.4.498,PRINCE HENRY,"That I will, by to-morrow dinner-time,"

1514,Henry IV,186,2.4.502,Sheriff,"I will, my lord. There are two gentlemen"
1515,Henry IV,186,2.4.503,Sheriff,Have in this robbery lost three hundred marks.
1516,Henry IV,187,2.4.504,PRINCE HENRY,"It may be so: if he have robb'd these men,"
1517,Henry IV,187,2.4.505,PRINCE HENRY,"He shall be answerable, and so farewell."
1518,Henry IV,188,2.4.506,Sheriff,"Good night, my noble lord."

1528,Henry IV,193,2.4.514,PRINCE HENRY,What hast thou found?
1529,Henry IV,194,2.4.515,PETO,"Nothing but papers, my lord."
1530,Henry IV,195,2.4.516,PRINCE HENRY,Let's see what they be: read them.
1531,Henry IV,196,2.4.517,PETO,"[Reads]  Item, A capon,. . 2s. 2d."

1536,Henry IV,197,2.4.522,PRINCE HENRY,O monstrous! but one half-penny-worth of bread to
1537,Henry IV,197,2.4.523,PRINCE HENRY,"this intolerable deal of sack! What there is else,"
1538,Henry IV,197,2.4.524,PRINCE HENRY,"keep close, we'll read it at more advantage: there"
1539,Henry IV,197,2.4.525,PRINCE HENRY,let him sleep till day. I'll to the court in the
1540,Henry IV,197,2.4.526,PRINCE HENRY,"morning. We must all to the wars, and thy place"
1541,Henry IV,197,2.4.527,PRINCE HENRY,shall be honourable. I'll procure this fat rogue a

1543,Henry IV,197,2.4.529,PRINCE HENRY,march of twelve-score. The money shall be paid
1544,Henry IV,197,2.4.530,PRINCE HENRY,back again with advantage. Be with me betimes in
1545,Henry IV,197,2.4.531,PRINCE HENRY,"the morning, and so, good morrow, Peto."

1549,Henry IV,198,2.4.532,PETO,SCENE I. Bangor. The Archdeacon's house.
1550,Henry IV,198,,PETO,"Enter HOTSPUR, WORCESTER, MORTIMER, and GLENDOWER"
1551,Henry IV,1,3.1.1,MORTIMER,"These promises are fair, the parties sure,"
1552,Henry IV,1,3.1.2,MORTIMER,And our induction full of prosperous hope.
1553,Henry IV,2,3.1.3,HOTSPUR,"Lord Mortimer, and cousin Glendower,"
1554,Henry IV,2,3.1.4,HOTSPUR,Will you sit down?
1555,Henry IV,2,3.1.5,HOTSPUR,And uncle Worcester: a plague upon it!
1556,Henry IV,2,3.1.6,HOTSPUR,I have forgot the map.
1557,Henry IV,3,3.1.7,GLENDOWER,"No, here it is."
1558,Henry IV,3,3.1.8,GLENDOWER,"Sit, cousin Percy, sit, good cousin Hotspur,"
1559,Henry IV,3,3.1.9,GLENDOWER,For by that name as oft as Lancaster
1560,Henry IV,3,3.1.10,GLENDOWER,"Doth speak of you, his cheek looks pale and with"
1561,Henry IV,3,3.1.11,GLENDOWER,A rising sigh he wisheth you in heaven.
1562,Henry IV,4,3.1.12,HOTSPUR,"And you in hell, as oft as he hears Owen Glendower spoke of."
1563,Henry IV,5,3.1.13,GLENDOWER,I cannot blame him: at my nativity
1564,Henry IV,5,3.1.14,GLENDOWER,"The front of heaven was full of fiery shapes,"
1565,Henry IV,5,3.1.15,GLENDOWER,"Of burning cressets, and at my birth"
1566,Henry IV,5,3.1.16,GLENDOWER,The frame and huge foundation of the earth
1567,Henry IV,5,3.1.17,GLENDOWER,Shaked like a coward.
1568,Henry IV,6,3.1.18,HOTSPUR,"Why, so it would have done at the same season, if"
1569,Henry IV,6,3.1.19,HOTSPUR,"your mother's cat had but kittened, though yourself"
1570,Henry IV,6,3.1.20,HOTSPUR,had never been born.
1571,Henry IV,7,3.1.21,GLENDOWER,I say the earth did shake when I was born.
1572,Henry IV,8,3.1.22,HOTSPUR,"And I say the earth was not of my mind,"
1573,Henry IV,8,3.1.23,HOTSPUR,If you suppose as fearing you it shook.
1574,Henry IV,9,3.1.24,GLENDOWER,"The heavens were all on fire, the earth did tremble."
1575,Henry IV,10,3.1.25,HOTSPUR,"O, then the earth shook to see the heavens on fire,"
1576,Henry IV,10,3.1.26,HOTSPUR,And not in fear of your nativity.
1577,Henry IV,10,3.1.27,HOTSPUR,Diseased nature oftentimes breaks forth
1578,Henry IV,10,3.1.28,HOTSPUR,"In strange eruptions, oft the teeming earth"
1579,Henry IV,10,3.1.29,HOTSPUR,Is with a kind of colic pinch'd and vex'd
1580,Henry IV,10,3.1.30,HOTSPUR,By the imprisoning of unruly wind
1581,Henry IV,10,3.1.31,HOTSPUR,"Within her womb, which, for enlargement striving,"
1582,Henry IV,10,3.1.32,HOTSPUR,Shakes the old beldam earth and topples down
1583,Henry IV,10,3.1.33,HOTSPUR,Steeples and moss-grown towers. At your birth
1584,Henry IV,10,3.1.34,HOTSPUR,"Our grandam earth, having this distemperature,"
1585,Henry IV,10,3.1.35,HOTSPUR,In passion shook.
1586,Henry IV,11,3.1.36,GLENDOWER,"Cousin, of many men"
1587,Henry IV,11,3.1.37,GLENDOWER,I do not bear these crossings. Give me leave
1588,Henry IV,11,3.1.38,GLENDOWER,To tell you once again that at my birth
1589,Henry IV,11,3.1.39,GLENDOWER,"The front of heaven was full of fiery shapes,"
1590,Henry IV,11,3.1.40,GLENDOWER,"The goats ran from the mountains, and the herds"
1591,Henry IV,11,3.1.41,GLENDOWER,Were strangely clamorous to the frighted fields.
1592,Henry IV,11,3.1.42,GLENDOWER,"These signs have mark'd me extraordinary,"
1593,Henry IV,11,3.1.43,GLENDOWER,And all the courses of my life do show
1594,Henry IV,11,3.1.44,GLENDOWER,I am not in the roll of common men.
1595,Henry IV,11,3.1.45,GLENDOWER,"Where is he living, clipp'd in with the sea"
1596,Henry IV,11,3.1.46,GLENDOWER,"That chides the banks of England, Scotland, Wales,"
1597,Henry IV,11,3.1.47,GLENDOWER,"Which calls me pupil, or hath read to me?"
1598,Henry IV,11,3.1.48,GLENDOWER,And bring him out that is but woman's son
1599,Henry IV,11,3.1.49,GLENDOWER,Can trace me in the tedious ways of art
1600,Henry IV,11,3.1.50,GLENDOWER,And hold me pace in deep experiments.
1601,Henry IV,12,3.1.51,HOTSPUR,I think there's no man speaks better Welsh.
1602,Henry IV,12,3.1.52,HOTSPUR,I'll to dinner.
1603,Henry IV,13,3.1.53,MORTIMER,"Peace, cousin Percy, you will make him mad."
1604,Henry IV,14,3.1.54,GLENDOWER,I can call spirits from the vasty deep.
1605,Henry IV,15,3.1.55,HOTSPUR,"Why, so can I, or so can any man,"
1606,Henry IV,15,3.1.56,HOTSPUR,But will they come when you do call for them?
1607,Henry IV,16,3.1.57,GLENDOWER,"Why, I can teach you, cousin, to command"
1608,Henry IV,16,3.1.58,GLENDOWER,The devil.
1609,Henry IV,17,3.1.59,HOTSPUR,"And I can teach thee, coz, to shame the devil"
1610,Henry IV,17,3.1.60,HOTSPUR,By telling truth: tell truth and shame the devil.
1611,Henry IV,17,3.1.61,HOTSPUR,"If thou have power to raise him, bring him hither,"
1612,Henry IV,17,3.1.62,HOTSPUR,And I'll be sworn I have power to shame him hence.
1613,Henry IV,17,3.1.63,HOTSPUR,"O, while you live, tell truth and shame the devil!"
1614,Henry IV,18,3.1.64,MORTIMER,"Come, come, no more of this unprofitable chat."
1615,Henry IV,19,3.1.65,GLENDOWER,Three times hath Henry Bolingbroke made head
1616,Henry IV,19,3.1.66,GLENDOWER,"Against my power, thrice from the banks of Wye"
1617,Henry IV,19,3.1.67,GLENDOWER,And sandy-bottom'd Severn have I sent him
1618,Henry IV,19,3.1.68,GLENDOWER,Bootless home and weather-beaten back.
1619,Henry IV,20,3.1.69,HOTSPUR,"Home without boots, and in foul weather too!"
1620,Henry IV,20,3.1.70,HOTSPUR,"How 'scapes he agues, in the devil's name?"
1621,Henry IV,21,3.1.71,GLENDOWER,"Come, here's the map: shall we divide our right"
1622,Henry IV,21,3.1.72,GLENDOWER,According to our threefold order ta'en?
1623,Henry IV,22,3.1.73,MORTIMER,The archdeacon hath divided it
1624,Henry IV,22,3.1.74,MORTIMER,Into three limits very equally:
1625,Henry IV,22,3.1.75,MORTIMER,"England, from Trent and Severn hitherto,"
1626,Henry IV,22,3.1.76,MORTIMER,By south and east is to my part assign'd:
1627,Henry IV,22,3.1.77,MORTIMER,"All westward, Wales beyond the Severn shore,"
1628,Henry IV,22,3.1.78,MORTIMER,"And all the fertile land within that bound,"
1629,Henry IV,22,3.1.79,MORTIMER,"To Owen Glendower: and, dear coz, to you"
1630,Henry IV,22,3.1.80,MORTIMER,"The remnant northward, lying off from Trent."
1631,Henry IV,22,3.1.81,MORTIMER,"And our indentures tripartite are drawn,"
1632,Henry IV,22,3.1.82,MORTIMER,"Which being sealed interchangeably,"
1633,Henry IV,22,3.1.83,MORTIMER,"A business that this night may execute,"
1634,Henry IV,22,3.1.84,MORTIMER,"To-morrow, cousin Percy, you and I"
1635,Henry IV,22,3.1.85,MORTIMER,And my good Lord of Worcester will set forth
1636,Henry IV,22,3.1.86,MORTIMER,"To meet your father and the Scottish power,"
1637,Henry IV,22,3.1.87,MORTIMER,"As is appointed us, at Shrewsbury."
1638,Henry IV,22,3.1.88,MORTIMER,"My father Glendower is not ready yet,"
1639,Henry IV,22,3.1.89,MORTIMER,Not shall we need his help these fourteen days.
1640,Henry IV,22,3.1.90,MORTIMER,Within that space you may have drawn together
1641,Henry IV,22,3.1.91,MORTIMER,"Your tenants, friends and neighbouring gentlemen."
1642,Henry IV,23,3.1.92,GLENDOWER,"A shorter time shall send me to you, lords:"
1643,Henry IV,23,3.1.93,GLENDOWER,"And in my conduct shall your ladies come,"
1644,Henry IV,23,3.1.94,GLENDOWER,"From whom you now must steal and take no leave,"
1645,Henry IV,23,3.1.95,GLENDOWER,For there will be a world of water shed
1646,Henry IV,23,3.1.96,GLENDOWER,Upon the parting of your wives and you.
1647,Henry IV,24,3.1.97,HOTSPUR,"Methinks my moiety, north from Burton here,"
1648,Henry IV,24,3.1.98,HOTSPUR,In quantity equals not one of yours:
1649,Henry IV,24,3.1.99,HOTSPUR,"See how this river comes me cranking in,"
1650,Henry IV,24,3.1.100,HOTSPUR,And cuts me from the best of all my land
1651,Henry IV,24,3.1.101,HOTSPUR,"A huge half-moon, a monstrous cantle out."
1652,Henry IV,24,3.1.102,HOTSPUR,"I'll have the current in this place damm'd up,"
1653,Henry IV,24,3.1.103,HOTSPUR,And here the smug and silver Trent shall run
1654,Henry IV,24,3.1.104,HOTSPUR,"In a new channel, fair and evenly,"
1655,Henry IV,24,3.1.105,HOTSPUR,"It shall not wind with such a deep indent,"
1656,Henry IV,24,3.1.106,HOTSPUR,To rob me of so rich a bottom here.
1657,Henry IV,25,3.1.107,GLENDOWER,"Not wind? it shall, it must, you see it doth."
1658,Henry IV,26,3.1.108,MORTIMER,"Yea, but"
1659,Henry IV,26,3.1.109,MORTIMER,"Mark how he bears his course, and runs me up"
1660,Henry IV,26,3.1.110,MORTIMER,"With like advantage on the other side,"
1661,Henry IV,26,3.1.111,MORTIMER,Gelding the opposed continent as much
1662,Henry IV,26,3.1.112,MORTIMER,As on the other side it takes from you.
1663,Henry IV,27,3.1.113,EARL OF WORCESTER,"Yea, but a little charge will trench him here"
1664,Henry IV,27,3.1.114,EARL OF WORCESTER,"And on this north side win this cape of land,"
1665,Henry IV,27,3.1.115,EARL OF WORCESTER,And then he runs straight and even.
1666,Henry IV,28,3.1.116,HOTSPUR,I'll have it so: a little charge will do it.
1667,Henry IV,29,3.1.117,GLENDOWER,I'll not have it alter'd.
1668,Henry IV,30,3.1.118,HOTSPUR,Will not you?
1669,Henry IV,31,3.1.119,GLENDOWER,"No, nor you shall not."
1670,Henry IV,32,3.1.120,HOTSPUR,Who shall say me nay?
1671,Henry IV,33,3.1.121,GLENDOWER,"Why, that will I."
1672,Henry IV,34,3.1.122,HOTSPUR,"Let me not understand you, then, speak it in Welsh."
1673,Henry IV,35,3.1.123,GLENDOWER,"I can speak English, lord, as well as you,"
1674,Henry IV,35,3.1.124,GLENDOWER,"For I was train'd up in the English court,"
1675,Henry IV,35,3.1.125,GLENDOWER,"Where, being but young, I framed to the harp"
1676,Henry IV,35,3.1.126,GLENDOWER,Many an English ditty lovely well
1677,Henry IV,35,3.1.127,GLENDOWER,"And gave the tongue a helpful ornament,"
1678,Henry IV,35,3.1.128,GLENDOWER,A virtue that was never seen in you.
1679,Henry IV,36,3.1.129,HOTSPUR,"Marry,"
1680,Henry IV,36,3.1.130,HOTSPUR,And I am glad of it with all my heart:
1681,Henry IV,36,3.1.131,HOTSPUR,I had rather be a kitten and cry mew
1682,Henry IV,36,3.1.132,HOTSPUR,"Than one of these same metre ballad-mongers,"
1683,Henry IV,36,3.1.133,HOTSPUR,"I had rather hear a brazen canstick turn'd,"
1684,Henry IV,36,3.1.134,HOTSPUR,"Or a dry wheel grate on the axle-tree,"
1685,Henry IV,36,3.1.135,HOTSPUR,"And that would set my teeth nothing on edge,"
1686,Henry IV,36,3.1.136,HOTSPUR,Nothing so much as mincing poetry:
1687,Henry IV,36,3.1.137,HOTSPUR,'Tis like the forced gait of a shuffling nag.
1688,Henry IV,37,3.1.138,GLENDOWER,"Come, you shall have Trent turn'd."
1689,Henry IV,38,3.1.139,HOTSPUR,I do not care: I'll give thrice so much land
1690,Henry IV,38,3.1.140,HOTSPUR,"To any well-deserving friend,"
1691,Henry IV,38,3.1.141,HOTSPUR,"But in the way of bargain, mark ye me,"
1692,Henry IV,38,3.1.142,HOTSPUR,I'll cavil on the ninth part of a hair.
1693,Henry IV,38,3.1.143,HOTSPUR,Are the indentures drawn? shall we be gone?
1694,Henry IV,39,3.1.144,GLENDOWER,"The moon shines fair, you may away by night:"
1695,Henry IV,39,3.1.145,GLENDOWER,I'll haste the writer and withal
1696,Henry IV,39,3.1.146,GLENDOWER,Break with your wives of your departure hence:
1697,Henry IV,39,3.1.147,GLENDOWER,"I am afraid my daughter will run mad,"
1698,Henry IV,39,3.1.148,GLENDOWER,So much she doteth on her Mortimer.
1699,Henry IV,39,,GLENDOWER,Exit GLENDOWER
1700,Henry IV,40,3.1.149,MORTIMER,"Fie, cousin Percy! how you cross my father!"
1701,Henry IV,41,3.1.150,HOTSPUR,I cannot choose: sometime he angers me
1702,Henry IV,41,3.1.151,HOTSPUR,"With telling me of the mouldwarp and the ant,"
1703,Henry IV,41,3.1.152,HOTSPUR,"Of the dreamer Merlin and his prophecies,"
1704,Henry IV,41,3.1.153,HOTSPUR,"And of a dragon and a finless fish,"
1705,Henry IV,41,3.1.154,HOTSPUR,"A clip-wing'd griffin and a moulten raven,"
1706,Henry IV,41,3.1.155,HOTSPUR,"A couching lion and a ramping cat,"
1707,Henry IV,41,3.1.156,HOTSPUR,And such a deal of skimble-skamble stuff
1708,Henry IV,41,3.1.157,HOTSPUR,"As puts me from my faith. I tell you what,"
1709,Henry IV,41,3.1.158,HOTSPUR,He held me last night at least nine hours
1710,Henry IV,41,3.1.159,HOTSPUR,In reckoning up the several devils' names
1711,Henry IV,41,3.1.160,HOTSPUR,"That were his lackeys: I cried 'hum,' and 'well, go to,'"
1712,Henry IV,41,3.1.161,HOTSPUR,"But mark'd him not a word. O, he is as tedious"
1713,Henry IV,41,3.1.162,HOTSPUR,"As a tired horse, a railing wife,"
1714,Henry IV,41,3.1.163,HOTSPUR,Worse than a smoky house: I had rather live
1715,Henry IV,41,3.1.164,HOTSPUR,"With cheese and garlic in a windmill, far,"
1716,Henry IV,41,3.1.165,HOTSPUR,Than feed on cates and have him talk to me
1717,Henry IV,41,3.1.166,HOTSPUR,In any summer-house in Christendom.
1718,Henry IV,42,3.1.167,MORTIMER,"In faith, he is a worthy gentleman,"
1719,Henry IV,42,3.1.168,MORTIMER,"Exceedingly well read, and profited"
1720,Henry IV,42,3.1.169,MORTIMER,"In strange concealments, valiant as a lion"
1721,Henry IV,42,3.1.170,MORTIMER,And as wondrous affable and as bountiful
1722,Henry IV,42,3.1.171,MORTIMER,"As mines of India. Shall I tell you, cousin?"
1723,Henry IV,42,3.1.172,MORTIMER,He holds your temper in a high respect
1724,Henry IV,42,3.1.173,MORTIMER,And curbs himself even of his natural scope
1725,Henry IV,42,3.1.174,MORTIMER,"When you come 'cross his humour, faith, he does:"
1726,Henry IV,42,3.1.175,MORTIMER,"I warrant you, that man is not alive"
1727,Henry IV,42,3.1.176,MORTIMER,"Might so have tempted him as you have done,"
1728,Henry IV,42,3.1.177,MORTIMER,Without the taste of danger and reproof:
1729,Henry IV,42,3.1.178,MORTIMER,"But do not use it oft, let me entreat you."
1730,Henry IV,43,3.1.179,EARL OF WORCESTER,"In faith, my lord, you are too wilful-blame,"
1731,Henry IV,43,3.1.180,EARL OF WORCESTER,And since your coming hither have done enough
1732,Henry IV,43,3.1.181,EARL OF WORCESTER,To put him quite beside his patience.
1733,Henry IV,43,3.1.182,EARL OF WORCESTER,"You must needs learn, lord, to amend this fault:"
1734,Henry IV,43,3.1.183,EARL OF WORCESTER,"Though sometimes it show greatness, courage, blood,--"
1735,Henry IV,43,3.1.184,EARL OF WORCESTER,"And that's the dearest grace it renders you,--"
1736,Henry IV,43,3.1.185,EARL OF WORCESTER,"Yet oftentimes it doth present harsh rage,"
1737,Henry IV,43,3.1.186,EARL OF WORCESTER,"Defect of manners, want of government,"
1738,Henry IV,43,3.1.187,EARL OF WORCESTER,"Pride, haughtiness, opinion and disdain:"
1739,Henry IV,43,3.1.188,EARL OF WORCESTER,The least of which haunting a nobleman
1740,Henry IV,43,3.1.189,EARL OF WORCESTER,Loseth men's hearts and leaves behind a stain
1741,Henry IV,43,3.1.190,EARL OF WORCESTER,"Upon the beauty of all parts besides,"
1742,Henry IV,43,3.1.191,EARL OF WORCESTER,Beguiling them of commendation.
1743,Henry IV,44,3.1.192,HOTSPUR,"Well, I am school'd: good manners be your speed!"
1744,Henry IV,44,3.1.193,HOTSPUR,"Here come our wives, and let us take our leave."
1745,Henry IV,44,,HOTSPUR,Re-enter GLENDOWER with the ladies
1746,Henry IV,45,3.1.194,MORTIMER,"This is the deadly spite that angers me,"
1747,Henry IV,45,3.1.195,MORTIMER,"My wife can speak no English, I no Welsh."
1748,Henry IV,46,3.1.196,GLENDOWER,"My daughter weeps: she will not part with you,"
1749,Henry IV,46,3.1.197,GLENDOWER,"She'll be a soldier too, she'll to the wars."
1750,Henry IV,47,3.1.198,MORTIMER,"Good father, tell her that she and my aunt Percy"
1751,Henry IV,47,3.1.199,MORTIMER,Shall follow in your conduct speedily.
1752,Henry IV,47,,MORTIMER,"Glendower speaks to her in Welsh, and she answers him in the same"
1753,Henry IV,48,3.1.200,GLENDOWER,"She is desperate here, a peevish self-wind harlotry,"
1754,Henry IV,48,3.1.201,GLENDOWER,one that no persuasion can do good upon.
1755,Henry IV,48,,GLENDOWER,The lady speaks in Welsh
1756,Henry IV,49,3.1.202,MORTIMER,I understand thy looks: that pretty Welsh
1757,Henry IV,49,3.1.203,MORTIMER,Which thou pour'st down from these swelling heavens
1758,Henry IV,49,3.1.204,MORTIMER,"I am too perfect in, and, but for shame,"
1759,Henry IV,49,3.1.205,MORTIMER,In such a parley should I answer thee.
1760,Henry IV,49,,MORTIMER,The lady speaks again in Welsh
1761,Henry IV,49,3.1.206,MORTIMER,"I understand thy kisses and thou mine,"
1762,Henry IV,49,3.1.207,MORTIMER,And that's a feeling disputation:
1763,Henry IV,49,3.1.208,MORTIMER,"But I will never be a truant, love,"
1764,Henry IV,49,3.1.209,MORTIMER,"Till I have learned thy language, for thy tongue"
1765,Henry IV,49,3.1.210,MORTIMER,"Makes Welsh as sweet as ditties highly penn'd,"
1766,Henry IV,49,3.1.211,MORTIMER,"Sung by a fair queen in a summer's bower,"
1767,Henry IV,49,3.1.212,MORTIMER,"With ravishing division, to her lute."
1768,Henry IV,50,3.1.213,GLENDOWER,"Nay, if you melt, then will she run mad."
1769,Henry IV,50,,GLENDOWER,The lady speaks again in Welsh
1770,Henry IV,51,3.1.214,MORTIMER,"O, I am ignorance itself in this!"
1771,Henry IV,52,3.1.215,GLENDOWER,She bids you on the wanton rushes lay you down
1772,Henry IV,52,3.1.216,GLENDOWER,"And rest your gentle head upon her lap,"
1773,Henry IV,52,3.1.217,GLENDOWER,And she will sing the song that pleaseth you
1774,Henry IV,52,3.1.218,GLENDOWER,And on your eyelids crown the god of sleep.
1775,Henry IV,52,3.1.219,GLENDOWER,"Charming your blood with pleasing heaviness,"
1776,Henry IV,52,3.1.220,GLENDOWER,Making such difference 'twixt wake and sleep
1777,Henry IV,52,3.1.221,GLENDOWER,As is the difference betwixt day and night
1778,Henry IV,52,3.1.222,GLENDOWER,The hour before the heavenly-harness'd team
1779,Henry IV,52,3.1.223,GLENDOWER,Begins his golden progress in the east.
1780,Henry IV,53,3.1.224,MORTIMER,With all my heart I'll sit and hear her sing:
1781,Henry IV,53,3.1.225,MORTIMER,"By that time will our book, I think, be drawn"
1782,Henry IV,54,3.1.226,GLENDOWER,"Do so,"
1783,Henry IV,54,3.1.227,GLENDOWER,And those musicians that shall play to you
1784,Henry IV,54,3.1.228,GLENDOWER,"Hang in the air a thousand leagues from hence,"
1785,Henry IV,54,3.1.229,GLENDOWER,"And straight they shall be here: sit, and attend."
1786,Henry IV,55,3.1.230,HOTSPUR,"Come, Kate, thou art perfect in lying down: come,"
1787,Henry IV,55,3.1.231,HOTSPUR,"quick, quick, that I may lay my head in thy lap."
1788,Henry IV,56,3.1.232,LADY PERCY,"Go, ye giddy goose."
1789,Henry IV,56,,LADY PERCY,The music plays
1790,Henry IV,57,3.1.233,HOTSPUR,"Now I perceive the devil understands Welsh,"
1791,Henry IV,57,3.1.234,HOTSPUR,And 'tis no marvel he is so humorous.
1792,Henry IV,57,3.1.235,HOTSPUR,"By'r lady, he is a good musician."
1793,Henry IV,58,3.1.236,LADY PERCY,Then should you be nothing but musical for you are
1794,Henry IV,58,3.1.237,LADY PERCY,"altogether governed by humours. Lie still, ye thief,"
1795,Henry IV,58,3.1.238,LADY PERCY,and hear the lady sing in Welsh.
1796,Henry IV,59,3.1.239,HOTSPUR,"I had rather hear Lady, my brach, howl in Irish."
1797,Henry IV,60,3.1.240,LADY PERCY,Wouldst thou have thy head broken?
1798,Henry IV,61,3.1.241,HOTSPUR,No.
1799,Henry IV,62,3.1.242,LADY PERCY,Then be still.
1800,Henry IV,63,3.1.243,HOTSPUR,"Neither,'tis a woman's fault."
1801,Henry IV,64,3.1.244,LADY PERCY,Now God help thee!
1802,Henry IV,65,3.1.245,HOTSPUR,To the Welsh lady's bed.
1803,Henry IV,66,3.1.246,LADY PERCY,What's that?
1804,Henry IV,67,3.1.247,HOTSPUR,Peace! she sings.
1805,Henry IV,67,,HOTSPUR,Here the lady sings a Welsh song
1806,Henry IV,68,3.1.248,HOTSPUR,"Come, Kate, I'll have your song too."
1807,Henry IV,69,3.1.249,LADY PERCY,"Not mine, in good sooth."
1808,Henry IV,70,3.1.250,HOTSPUR,"Not yours, in good sooth! Heart! you swear like a"
1809,Henry IV,70,3.1.251,HOTSPUR,"comfit-maker's wife. 'Not you, in good sooth,' and"
1810,Henry IV,70,3.1.252,HOTSPUR,"'as true as I live,' and 'as God shall mend me,' and"
1811,Henry IV,70,3.1.253,HOTSPUR,"'as sure as day,'"
1812,Henry IV,70,3.1.254,HOTSPUR,"And givest such sarcenet surety for thy oaths,"
1813,Henry IV,70,3.1.255,HOTSPUR,As if thou never walk'st further than Finsbury.
1814,Henry IV,70,3.1.256,HOTSPUR,"Swear me, Kate, like a lady as thou art,"
1815,Henry IV,70,3.1.257,HOTSPUR,"A good mouth-filling oath, and leave 'in sooth,'"
1816,Henry IV,70,3.1.258,HOTSPUR,"And such protest of pepper-gingerbread,"
1817,Henry IV,70,3.1.259,HOTSPUR,To velvet-guards and Sunday-citizens.
1818,Henry IV,70,3.1.260,HOTSPUR,"Come, sing."
1819,Henry IV,71,3.1.261,LADY PERCY,I will not sing.
1820,Henry IV,72,3.1.262,HOTSPUR,"'Tis the next way to turn tailor, or be red-breast"
1821,Henry IV,72,3.1.263,HOTSPUR,"teacher. An the indentures be drawn, I'll away"
1822,Henry IV,72,3.1.264,HOTSPUR,"within these two hours, and so, come in when ye will."
1823,Henry IV,72,,HOTSPUR,Exit
1824,Henry IV,73,3.1.265,GLENDOWER,"Come, come, Lord Mortimer, you are as slow"
1825,Henry IV,73,3.1.266,GLENDOWER,As hot Lord Percy is on fire to go.
1826,Henry IV,73,3.1.267,GLENDOWER,"By this our book is drawn, we'll but seal,"
1827,Henry IV,73,3.1.268,GLENDOWER,And then to horse immediately.
1828,Henry IV,74,3.1.269,MORTIMER,With all my heart.

1830,Henry IV,74,,MORTIMER,SCENE II. London. The palace.
1831,Henry IV,74,,MORTIMER,"Enter KING HENRY IV, PRINCE HENRY, and others"
1832,Henry IV,1,3.2.1,KING HENRY IV,"Lords, give us leave, the Prince of Wales and I"
1833,Henry IV,1,3.2.2,KING HENRY IV,"Must have some private conference, but be near at hand,"
1834,Henry IV,1,3.2.3,KING HENRY IV,For we shall presently have need of you.
1835,Henry IV,1,,KING HENRY IV,Exeunt Lords
1836,Henry IV,1,3.2.4,KING HENRY IV,"I know not whether God will have it so,"
1837,Henry IV,1,3.2.5,KING HENRY IV,"For some displeasing service I have done,"
1838,Henry IV,1,3.2.6,KING HENRY IV,"That, in his secret doom, out of my blood"
1839,Henry IV,1,3.2.7,KING HENRY IV,"He'll breed revengement and a scourge for me,"
1840,Henry IV,1,3.2.8,KING HENRY IV,But thou dost in thy passages of life
1841,Henry IV,1,3.2.9,KING HENRY IV,Make me believe that thou art only mark'd
1842,Henry IV,1,3.2.10,KING HENRY IV,For the hot vengeance and the rod of heaven
1843,Henry IV,1,3.2.11,KING HENRY IV,"To punish my mistreadings. Tell me else,"
1844,Henry IV,1,3.2.12,KING HENRY IV,"Could such inordinate and low desires,"
1845,Henry IV,1,3.2.13,KING HENRY IV,"Such poor, such bare, such lewd, such mean attempts,"
1846,Henry IV,1,3.2.14,KING HENRY IV,"Such barren pleasures, rude society,"
1847,Henry IV,1,3.2.15,KING HENRY IV,"As thou art match'd withal and grafted to,"
1848,Henry IV,1,3.2.16,KING HENRY IV,Accompany the greatness of thy blood
1849,Henry IV,1,3.2.17,KING HENRY IV,And hold their level with thy princely heart?
1850,Henry IV,2,3.2.18,PRINCE HENRY,"So please your majesty, I would I could"
1851,Henry IV,2,3.2.19,PRINCE HENRY,Quit all offences with as clear excuse
1852,Henry IV,2,3.2.20,PRINCE HENRY,As well as I am doubtless I can purge
1853,Henry IV,2,3.2.21,PRINCE HENRY,Myself of many I am charged withal:
1854,Henry IV,2,3.2.22,PRINCE HENRY,"Yet such extenuation let me beg,"
1855,Henry IV,2,3.2.23,PRINCE HENRY,"As, in reproof of many tales devised,"
1856,Henry IV,2,3.2.24,PRINCE HENRY,"which oft the ear of greatness needs must hear,"
1857,Henry IV,2,3.2.25,PRINCE HENRY,"By smiling pick-thanks and base news-mongers,"
1858,Henry IV,2,3.2.26,PRINCE HENRY,"I may, for some things true, wherein my youth"
1859,Henry IV,2,3.2.27,PRINCE HENRY,"Hath faulty wander'd and irregular,"
1860,Henry IV,2,3.2.28,PRINCE HENRY,Find pardon on my true submission.
1861,Henry IV,3,3.2.29,KING HENRY IV,"God pardon thee! yet let me wonder, Harry,"
1862,Henry IV,3,3.2.30,KING HENRY IV,"At thy affections, which do hold a wing"
1863,Henry IV,3,3.2.31,KING HENRY IV,Quite from the flight of all thy ancestors.
1864,Henry IV,3,3.2.32,KING HENRY IV,Thy place in council thou hast rudely lost.
1865,Henry IV,3,3.2.33,KING HENRY IV,"Which by thy younger brother is supplied,"
1866,Henry IV,3,3.2.34,KING HENRY IV,And art almost an alien to the hearts
1867,Henry IV,3,3.2.35,KING HENRY IV,Of all the court and princes of my blood:
1868,Henry IV,3,3.2.36,KING HENRY IV,The hope and expectation of thy time
1869,Henry IV,3,3.2.37,KING HENRY IV,"Is ruin'd, and the soul of every man"
1870,Henry IV,3,3.2.38,KING HENRY IV,Prophetically doth forethink thy fall.
1871,Henry IV,3,3.2.39,KING HENRY IV,"Had I so lavish of my presence been,"
1872,Henry IV,3,3.2.40,KING HENRY IV,"So common-hackney'd in the eyes of men,"
1873,Henry IV,3,3.2.41,KING HENRY IV,"So stale and cheap to vulgar company,"
1874,Henry IV,3,3.2.42,KING HENRY IV,"Opinion, that did help me to the crown,"
1875,Henry IV,3,3.2.43,KING HENRY IV,Had still kept loyal to possession
1876,Henry IV,3,3.2.44,KING HENRY IV,"And left me in reputeless banishment,"
1877,Henry IV,3,3.2.45,KING HENRY IV,A fellow of no mark nor likelihood.
1878,Henry IV,3,3.2.46,KING HENRY IV,"By being seldom seen, I could not stir"
1879,Henry IV,3,3.2.47,KING HENRY IV,"But like a comet I was wonder'd at,"
1880,Henry IV,3,3.2.48,KING HENRY IV,"That men would tell their children 'This is he,'"
1881,Henry IV,3,3.2.49,KING HENRY IV,"Others would say 'Where, which is Bolingbroke?'"
1882,Henry IV,3,3.2.50,KING HENRY IV,"And then I stole all courtesy from heaven,"
1883,Henry IV,3,3.2.51,KING HENRY IV,And dress'd myself in such humility
1884,Henry IV,3,3.2.52,KING HENRY IV,"That I did pluck allegiance from men's hearts,"
1885,Henry IV,3,3.2.53,KING HENRY IV,"Loud shouts and salutations from their mouths,"
1886,Henry IV,3,3.2.54,KING HENRY IV,Even in the presence of the crowned king.
1887,Henry IV,3,3.2.55,KING HENRY IV,"Thus did I keep my person fresh and new,"
1888,Henry IV,3,3.2.56,KING HENRY IV,"My presence, like a robe pontifical,"
1889,Henry IV,3,3.2.57,KING HENRY IV,"Ne'er seen but wonder'd at: and so my state,"
1890,Henry IV,3,3.2.58,KING HENRY IV,"Seldom but sumptuous, showed like a feast"
1891,Henry IV,3,3.2.59,KING HENRY IV,And won by rareness such solemnity.
1892,Henry IV,3,3.2.60,KING HENRY IV,"The skipping king, he ambled up and down"
1893,Henry IV,3,3.2.61,KING HENRY IV,"With shallow jesters and rash bavin wits,"
1894,Henry IV,3,3.2.62,KING HENRY IV,"Soon kindled and soon burnt, carded his state,"
1895,Henry IV,3,3.2.63,KING HENRY IV,"Mingled his royalty with capering fools,"
1896,Henry IV,3,3.2.64,KING HENRY IV,Had his great name profaned with their scorns
1897,Henry IV,3,3.2.65,KING HENRY IV,"And gave his countenance, against his name,"
1898,Henry IV,3,3.2.66,KING HENRY IV,To laugh at gibing boys and stand the push
1899,Henry IV,3,3.2.67,KING HENRY IV,"Of every beardless vain comparative,"
1900,Henry IV,3,3.2.68,KING HENRY IV,"Grew a companion to the common streets,"
1901,Henry IV,3,3.2.69,KING HENRY IV,"Enfeoff'd himself to popularity,"
1902,Henry IV,3,3.2.70,KING HENRY IV,"That, being daily swallow'd by men's eyes,"
1903,Henry IV,3,3.2.71,KING HENRY IV,They surfeited with honey and began
1904,Henry IV,3,3.2.72,KING HENRY IV,"To loathe the taste of sweetness, whereof a little"
1905,Henry IV,3,3.2.73,KING HENRY IV,More than a little is by much too much.
1906,Henry IV,3,3.2.74,KING HENRY IV,"So when he had occasion to be seen,"
1907,Henry IV,3,3.2.75,KING HENRY IV,"He was but as the cuckoo is in June,"
1908,Henry IV,3,3.2.76,KING HENRY IV,"Heard, not regarded, seen, but with such eyes"
1909,Henry IV,3,3.2.77,KING HENRY IV,"As, sick and blunted with community,"
1910,Henry IV,3,3.2.78,KING HENRY IV,"Afford no extraordinary gaze,"
1911,Henry IV,3,3.2.79,KING HENRY IV,Such as is bent on sun-like majesty
1912,Henry IV,3,3.2.80,KING HENRY IV,"When it shines seldom in admiring eyes,"
1913,Henry IV,3,3.2.81,KING HENRY IV,"But rather drowzed and hung their eyelids down,"
1914,Henry IV,3,3.2.82,KING HENRY IV,Slept in his face and render'd such aspect
1915,Henry IV,3,3.2.83,KING HENRY IV,"As cloudy men use to their adversaries,"
1916,Henry IV,3,3.2.84,KING HENRY IV,"Being with his presence glutted, gorged and full."
1917,Henry IV,3,3.2.85,KING HENRY IV,"And in that very line, Harry, standest thou,"
1918,Henry IV,3,3.2.86,KING HENRY IV,For thou has lost thy princely privilege
1919,Henry IV,3,3.2.87,KING HENRY IV,With vile participation: not an eye
1920,Henry IV,3,3.2.88,KING HENRY IV,"But is a-weary of thy common sight,"
1921,Henry IV,3,3.2.89,KING HENRY IV,"Save mine, which hath desired to see thee more,"
1922,Henry IV,3,3.2.90,KING HENRY IV,"Which now doth that I would not have it do,"
1923,Henry IV,3,3.2.91,KING HENRY IV,Make blind itself with foolish tenderness.
1924,Henry IV,4,3.2.92,PRINCE HENRY,"I shall hereafter, my thrice gracious lord,"
1925,Henry IV,4,3.2.93,PRINCE HENRY,Be more myself.
1926,Henry IV,5,3.2.94,KING HENRY IV,For all the world
1927,Henry IV,5,3.2.95,KING HENRY IV,As thou art to this hour was Richard then
1928,Henry IV,5,3.2.96,KING HENRY IV,"When I from France set foot at Ravenspurgh,"
1929,Henry IV,5,3.2.97,KING HENRY IV,And even as I was then is Percy now.
1930,Henry IV,5,3.2.98,KING HENRY IV,"Now, by my sceptre and my soul to boot,"
1931,Henry IV,5,3.2.99,KING HENRY IV,He hath more worthy interest to the state
1932,Henry IV,5,3.2.100,KING HENRY IV,"Than thou the shadow of succession,"
1933,Henry IV,5,3.2.101,KING HENRY IV,"For of no right, nor colour like to right,"
1934,Henry IV,5,3.2.102,KING HENRY IV,"He doth fill fields with harness in the realm,"
1935,Henry IV,5,3.2.103,KING HENRY IV,"Turns head against the lion's armed jaws,"
1936,Henry IV,5,3.2.104,KING HENRY IV,"And, being no more in debt to years than thou,"
1937,Henry IV,5,3.2.105,KING HENRY IV,Leads ancient lords and reverend bishops on
1938,Henry IV,5,3.2.106,KING HENRY IV,To bloody battles and to bruising arms.
1939,Henry IV,5,3.2.107,KING HENRY IV,What never-dying honour hath he got
1940,Henry IV,5,3.2.108,KING HENRY IV,"Against renowned Douglas! whose high deeds,"
1941,Henry IV,5,3.2.109,KING HENRY IV,Whose hot incursions and great name in arms
1942,Henry IV,5,3.2.110,KING HENRY IV,Holds from all soldiers chief majority
1943,Henry IV,5,3.2.111,KING HENRY IV,And military title capital
1944,Henry IV,5,3.2.112,KING HENRY IV,Through all the kingdoms that acknowledge Christ:
1945,Henry IV,5,3.2.113,KING HENRY IV,"Thrice hath this Hotspur, Mars in swathling clothes,"
1946,Henry IV,5,3.2.114,KING HENRY IV,"This infant warrior, in his enterprises"
1947,Henry IV,5,3.2.115,KING HENRY IV,"Discomfited great Douglas, ta'en him once,"
1948,Henry IV,5,3.2.116,KING HENRY IV,"Enlarged him and made a friend of him,"
1949,Henry IV,5,3.2.117,KING HENRY IV,To fill the mouth of deep defiance up
1950,Henry IV,5,3.2.118,KING HENRY IV,And shake the peace and safety of our throne.
1951,Henry IV,5,3.2.119,KING HENRY IV,"And what say you to this? Percy, Northumberland,"
1952,Henry IV,5,3.2.120,KING HENRY IV,"The Archbishop's grace of York, Douglas, Mortimer,"
1953,Henry IV,5,3.2.121,KING HENRY IV,Capitulate against us and are up.
1954,Henry IV,5,3.2.122,KING HENRY IV,But wherefore do I tell these news to thee?
1955,Henry IV,5,3.2.123,KING HENRY IV,"Why, Harry, do I tell thee of my foes,"
1956,Henry IV,5,3.2.124,KING HENRY IV,Which art my near'st and dearest enemy?
1957,Henry IV,5,3.2.125,KING HENRY IV,"Thou that art like enough, through vassal fear,"
1958,Henry IV,5,3.2.126,KING HENRY IV,Base inclination and the start of spleen
1959,Henry IV,5,3.2.127,KING HENRY IV,"To fight against me under Percy's pay,"
1960,Henry IV,5,3.2.128,KING HENRY IV,"To dog his heels and curtsy at his frowns,"
1961,Henry IV,5,3.2.129,KING HENRY IV,To show how much thou art degenerate.
1962,Henry IV,6,3.2.130,PRINCE HENRY,"Do not think so, you shall not find it so:"
1963,Henry IV,6,3.2.131,PRINCE HENRY,And God forgive them that so much have sway'd
1964,Henry IV,6,3.2.132,PRINCE HENRY,Your majesty's good thoughts away from me!
1965,Henry IV,6,3.2.133,PRINCE HENRY,I will redeem all this on Percy's head
1966,Henry IV,6,3.2.134,PRINCE HENRY,And in the closing of some glorious day
1967,Henry IV,6,3.2.135,PRINCE HENRY,"Be bold to tell you that I am your son,"
1968,Henry IV,6,3.2.136,PRINCE HENRY,When I will wear a garment all of blood
1969,Henry IV,6,3.2.137,PRINCE HENRY,"And stain my favours in a bloody mask,"
1970,Henry IV,6,3.2.138,PRINCE HENRY,"Which, wash'd away, shall scour my shame with it:"
1971,Henry IV,6,3.2.139,PRINCE HENRY,"And that shall be the day, whene'er it lights,"
1972,Henry IV,6,3.2.140,PRINCE HENRY,"That this same child of honour and renown,"
1973,Henry IV,6,3.2.141,PRINCE HENRY,"This gallant Hotspur, this all-praised knight,"
1974,Henry IV,6,3.2.142,PRINCE HENRY,And your unthought-of Harry chance to meet.
1975,Henry IV,6,3.2.143,PRINCE HENRY,"For every honour sitting on his helm,"
1976,Henry IV,6,3.2.144,PRINCE HENRY,"Would they were multitudes, and on my head"
1977,Henry IV,6,3.2.145,PRINCE HENRY,"My shames redoubled! for the time will come,"
1978,Henry IV,6,3.2.146,PRINCE HENRY,That I shall make this northern youth exchange
1979,Henry IV,6,3.2.147,PRINCE HENRY,His glorious deeds for my indignities.
1980,Henry IV,6,3.2.148,PRINCE HENRY,"Percy is but my factor, good my lord,"
1981,Henry IV,6,3.2.149,PRINCE HENRY,"To engross up glorious deeds on my behalf,"
1982,Henry IV,6,3.2.150,PRINCE HENRY,"And I will call him to so strict account,"
1983,Henry IV,6,3.2.151,PRINCE HENRY,"That he shall render every glory up,"
1984,Henry IV,6,3.2.152,PRINCE HENRY,"Yea, even the slightest worship of his time,"
1985,Henry IV,6,3.2.153,PRINCE HENRY,Or I will tear the reckoning from his heart.
1986,Henry IV,6,3.2.154,PRINCE HENRY,"This, in the name of God, I promise here:"
1987,Henry IV,6,3.2.155,PRINCE HENRY,"The which if He be pleased I shall perform,"
1988,Henry IV,6,3.2.156,PRINCE HENRY,I do beseech your majesty may salve
1989,Henry IV,6,3.2.157,PRINCE HENRY,The long-grown wounds of my intemperance:
1990,Henry IV,6,3.2.158,PRINCE HENRY,"If not, the end of life cancels all bands,"
1991,Henry IV,6,3.2.159,PRINCE HENRY,And I will die a hundred thousand deaths
1992,Henry IV,6,3.2.160,PRINCE HENRY,Ere break the smallest parcel of this vow.
1993,Henry IV,7,3.2.161,KING HENRY IV,A hundred thousand rebels die in this:
1994,Henry IV,7,3.2.162,KING HENRY IV,Thou shalt have charge and sovereign trust herein.
1995,Henry IV,7,,KING HENRY IV,Enter BLUNT
1996,Henry IV,7,3.2.163,KING HENRY IV,"How now, good Blunt? thy looks are full of speed."
1997,Henry IV,8,3.2.164,SIR WALTER BLUNT,So hath the business that I come to speak of.
1998,Henry IV,8,3.2.165,SIR WALTER BLUNT,Lord Mortimer of Scotland hath sent word
1999,Henry IV,8,3.2.166,SIR WALTER BLUNT,That Douglas and the English rebels met
2000,Henry IV,8,3.2.167,SIR WALTER BLUNT,The eleventh of this month at Shrewsbury
2001,Henry IV,8,3.2.168,SIR WALTER BLUNT,"A mighty and a fearful head they are,"
2002,Henry IV,8,3.2.169,SIR WALTER BLUNT,"If promises be kept on every hand,"
2003,Henry IV,8,3.2.170,SIR WALTER BLUNT,As ever offer'd foul play in the state.
2004,Henry IV,9,3.2.171,KING HENRY IV,"The Earl of Westmoreland set forth to-day,"
2005,Henry IV,9,3.2.172,KING HENRY IV,"With him my son, Lord John of Lancaster,"
2006,Henry IV,9,3.2.173,KING HENRY IV,For this advertisement is five days old:
2007,Henry IV,9,3.2.174,KING HENRY IV,"On Wednesday next, Harry, you shall set forward,"
2008,Henry IV,9,3.2.175,KING HENRY IV,On Thursday we ourselves will march: our meeting
2009,Henry IV,9,3.2.176,KING HENRY IV,"Is Bridgenorth: and, Harry, you shall march"

2011,Henry IV,9,3.2.178,KING HENRY IV,"Our business valued, some twelve days hence"
2012,Henry IV,9,3.2.179,KING HENRY IV,Our general forces at Bridgenorth shall meet.
2013,Henry IV,9,3.2.180,KING HENRY IV,"Our hands are full of business: let's away,"

2017,Henry IV,10,,,Enter FALSTAFF and BARDOLPH
2018,Henry IV,11,3.2.183,FALSTAFF,"Bardolph, am I not fallen away vilely since this last"
2019,Henry IV,11,3.2.184,FALSTAFF,action? do I not bate? do I not dwindle? Why my
2020,Henry IV,11,3.2.185,FALSTAFF,skin hangs about me like an like an old lady's loose
2021,Henry IV,11,3.2.186,FALSTAFF,"gown, I am withered like an old apple-john. Well,"
2022,Henry IV,11,3.2.187,FALSTAFF,"I'll repent, and that suddenly, while I am in some"
2023,Henry IV,11,3.2.188,FALSTAFF,"liking, I shall be out of heart shortly, and then I"
2024,Henry IV,11,3.2.189,FALSTAFF,shall have no strength to repent. An I have not
2025,Henry IV,11,3.2.190,FALSTAFF,"forgotten what the inside of a church is made of, I"
2026,Henry IV,11,3.2.191,FALSTAFF,"am a peppercorn, a brewer's horse: the inside of a"
2027,Henry IV,11,3.2.192,FALSTAFF,"church! Company, villanous company, hath been the"
2028,Henry IV,11,3.2.193,FALSTAFF,spoil of me.
2029,Henry IV,12,3.2.194,BARDOLPH,"Sir John, you are so fretful, you cannot live long."
2030,Henry IV,13,3.2.195,FALSTAFF,"Why, there is it: come sing me a bawdy song, make"
2031,Henry IV,13,3.2.196,FALSTAFF,me merry. I was as virtuously given as a gentleman
2032,Henry IV,13,3.2.197,FALSTAFF,"need to be, virtuous enough, swore little, diced not"
2033,Henry IV,13,3.2.198,FALSTAFF,"above seven times a week, went to a bawdy-house once"
2034,Henry IV,13,3.2.199,FALSTAFF,"in a quarter--of an hour, paid money that I"
2035,Henry IV,13,3.2.200,FALSTAFF,"borrowed, three of four times, lived well and in"
2036,Henry IV,13,3.2.201,FALSTAFF,"good compass: and now I live out of all order, out"
2037,Henry IV,13,3.2.202,FALSTAFF,of all compass.
2038,Henry IV,14,3.2.203,BARDOLPH,"Why, you are so fat, Sir John, that you must needs"
2039,Henry IV,14,3.2.204,BARDOLPH,"be out of all compass, out of all reasonable"
2040,Henry IV,14,3.2.205,BARDOLPH,"compass, Sir John."
2041,Henry IV,15,3.2.206,FALSTAFF,"Do thou amend thy face, and I'll amend my life:"
2042,Henry IV,15,3.2.207,FALSTAFF,"thou art our admiral, thou bearest the lantern in"
2043,Henry IV,15,3.2.208,FALSTAFF,"the poop, but 'tis in the nose of thee, thou art the"
2044,Henry IV,15,3.2.209,FALSTAFF,Knight of the Burning Lamp.
2045,Henry IV,16,3.2.210,BARDOLPH,"Why, Sir John, my face does you no harm."
2046,Henry IV,17,3.2.211,FALSTAFF,"No, I'll be sworn, I make as good use of it as many"
2047,Henry IV,17,3.2.212,FALSTAFF,a man doth of a Death's-head or a memento mori: I
2048,Henry IV,17,3.2.213,FALSTAFF,never see thy face but I think upon hell-fire and
2049,Henry IV,17,3.2.214,FALSTAFF,"Dives that lived in purple, for there he is in his"
2050,Henry IV,17,3.2.215,FALSTAFF,"robes, burning, burning. If thou wert any way"
2051,Henry IV,17,3.2.216,FALSTAFF,"given to virtue, I would swear by thy face, my oath"
2052,Henry IV,17,3.2.217,FALSTAFF,"should be 'By this fire, that's God's angel:' but"
2053,Henry IV,17,3.2.218,FALSTAFF,"thou art altogether given over, and wert indeed, but"
2054,Henry IV,17,3.2.219,FALSTAFF,"for the light in thy face, the son of utter"

2057,Henry IV,17,3.2.222,FALSTAFF,"hadst been an ignis fatuus or a ball of wildfire,"
2058,Henry IV,17,3.2.223,FALSTAFF,"there's no purchase in money. O, thou art a"
2059,Henry IV,17,3.2.224,FALSTAFF,"perpetual triumph, an everlasting bonfire-light!"
2060,Henry IV,17,3.2.225,FALSTAFF,Thou hast saved me a thousand marks in links and
2061,Henry IV,17,3.2.226,FALSTAFF,"torches, walking with thee in the night betwixt"
2062,Henry IV,17,3.2.227,FALSTAFF,tavern and tavern: but the sack that thou hast
2063,Henry IV,17,3.2.228,FALSTAFF,drunk me would have bought me lights as good cheap
2064,Henry IV,17,3.2.229,FALSTAFF,at the dearest chandler's in Europe. I have
2065,Henry IV,17,3.2.230,FALSTAFF,maintained that salamander of yours with fire any
2066,Henry IV,17,3.2.231,FALSTAFF,"time this two and thirty years, God reward me for"
2067,Henry IV,17,3.2.232,FALSTAFF,it!
2068,Henry IV,18,3.2.233,BARDOLPH,"'Sblood, I would my face were in your belly!"
2069,Henry IV,19,3.2.234,FALSTAFF,God-a-mercy! so should I be sure to be heart-burned.
2070,Henry IV,19,,FALSTAFF,Enter Hostess
2071,Henry IV,19,3.2.235,FALSTAFF,"How now, Dame Partlet the hen! have you inquired"
2072,Henry IV,19,3.2.236,FALSTAFF,yet who picked my pocket?
2073,Henry IV,20,3.2.237,Hostess,"Why, Sir John, what do you think, Sir John? do you"
2074,Henry IV,20,3.2.238,Hostess,"think I keep thieves in my house? I have searched,"
2075,Henry IV,20,3.2.239,Hostess,"I have inquired, so has my husband, man by man, boy"
2076,Henry IV,20,3.2.240,Hostess,"by boy, servant by servant: the tithe of a hair"
2077,Henry IV,20,3.2.241,Hostess,was never lost in my house before.
2078,Henry IV,21,3.2.242,FALSTAFF,"Ye lie, hostess: Bardolph was shaved and lost many"
2079,Henry IV,21,3.2.243,FALSTAFF,"a hair, and I'll be sworn my pocket was picked. Go"
2080,Henry IV,21,3.2.244,FALSTAFF,"to, you are a woman, go."
2081,Henry IV,22,3.2.245,Hostess,"Who, I? no, I defy thee: God's light, I was never"
2082,Henry IV,22,3.2.246,Hostess,called so in mine own house before.
2083,Henry IV,23,3.2.247,FALSTAFF,"Go to, I know you well enough."
2084,Henry IV,24,3.2.248,Hostess,"No, Sir John, You do not know me, Sir John. I know"
2085,Henry IV,24,3.2.249,Hostess,"you, Sir John: you owe me money, Sir John, and now"
2086,Henry IV,24,3.2.250,Hostess,you pick a quarrel to beguile me of it: I bought
2087,Henry IV,24,3.2.251,Hostess,you a dozen of shirts to your back.
2088,Henry IV,25,3.2.252,FALSTAFF,"Dowlas, filthy dowlas: I have given them away to"
2089,Henry IV,25,3.2.253,FALSTAFF,"bakers' wives, and they have made bolters of them."
2090,Henry IV,26,3.2.254,Hostess,"Now, as I am a true woman, holland of eight"
2091,Henry IV,26,3.2.255,Hostess,"shillings an ell. You owe money here besides, Sir"
2092,Henry IV,26,3.2.256,Hostess,"John, for your diet and by-drinkings, and money lent"
2093,Henry IV,26,3.2.257,Hostess,"you, four and twenty pound."
2094,Henry IV,27,3.2.258,FALSTAFF,"He had his part of it, let him pay."
2095,Henry IV,28,3.2.259,Hostess,"He? alas, he is poor, he hath nothing."
2096,Henry IV,29,3.2.260,FALSTAFF,"How! poor? look upon his face, what call you rich?"
2097,Henry IV,29,3.2.261,FALSTAFF,"let them coin his nose, let them coin his cheeks:"
2098,Henry IV,29,3.2.262,FALSTAFF,"Ill not pay a denier. What, will you make a younker"
2099,Henry IV,29,3.2.263,FALSTAFF,of me? shall I not take mine case in mine inn but I
2100,Henry IV,29,3.2.264,FALSTAFF,shall have my pocket picked? I have lost a
2101,Henry IV,29,3.2.265,FALSTAFF,seal-ring of my grandfather's worth forty mark.
2102,Henry IV,30,3.2.266,Hostess,"O Jesu, I have heard the prince tell him, I know not"
2103,Henry IV,30,3.2.267,Hostess,"how oft, that ring was copper!"
2104,Henry IV,31,3.2.268,FALSTAFF,"How! the prince is a Jack, a sneak-cup: 'sblood, an"
2105,Henry IV,31,3.2.269,FALSTAFF,"he were here, I would cudgel him like a dog, if he"
2106,Henry IV,31,3.2.270,FALSTAFF,would say so.
2107,Henry IV,31,,FALSTAFF,"Enter PRINCE HENRY and PETO, marching, and FALSTAFF meets them playing on his truncheon like a life"
2108,Henry IV,31,3.2.271,FALSTAFF,"How now, lad! is the wind in that door, i' faith?"
2109,Henry IV,31,3.2.272,FALSTAFF,must we all march?
2110,Henry IV,32,3.2.273,BARDOLPH,"Yea, two and two, Newgate fashion."
2111,Henry IV,33,3.2.274,Hostess,"My lord, I pray you, hear me."
2112,Henry IV,34,3.2.275,PRINCE HENRY,"What sayest thou, Mistress Quickly? How doth thy"
2113,Henry IV,34,3.2.276,PRINCE HENRY,"husband? I love him well, he is an honest man."
2114,Henry IV,35,3.2.277,Hostess,"Good my lord, hear me."
2115,Henry IV,36,3.2.278,FALSTAFF,"Prithee, let her alone, and list to me."
2116,Henry IV,37,3.2.279,PRINCE HENRY,"What sayest thou, Jack?"
2117,Henry IV,38,3.2.280,FALSTAFF,The other night I fell asleep here behind the arras
2118,Henry IV,38,3.2.281,FALSTAFF,and had my pocket picked: this house is turned
2119,Henry IV,38,3.2.282,FALSTAFF,"bawdy-house, they pick pockets."
2120,Henry IV,39,3.2.283,PRINCE HENRY,"What didst thou lose, Jack?"
2121,Henry IV,40,3.2.284,FALSTAFF,"Wilt thou believe me, Hal? three or four bonds of"
2122,Henry IV,40,3.2.285,FALSTAFF,"forty pound apiece, and a seal-ring of my"
2123,Henry IV,40,3.2.286,FALSTAFF,grandfather's.
2124,Henry IV,41,3.2.287,PRINCE HENRY,"A trifle, some eight-penny matter."
2125,Henry IV,42,3.2.288,Hostess,"So I told him, my lord, and I said I heard your"
2126,Henry IV,42,3.2.289,Hostess,"grace say so: and, my lord, he speaks most vilely"
2127,Henry IV,42,3.2.290,Hostess,"of you, like a foul-mouthed man as he is, and said"
2128,Henry IV,42,3.2.291,Hostess,he would cudgel you.
2129,Henry IV,43,3.2.292,PRINCE HENRY,What! he did not?
2130,Henry IV,44,3.2.293,Hostess,"There's neither faith, truth, nor womanhood in me else."
2131,Henry IV,45,3.2.294,FALSTAFF,There's no more faith in thee than in a stewed
2132,Henry IV,45,3.2.295,FALSTAFF,"prune, nor no more truth in thee than in a drawn"
2133,Henry IV,45,3.2.296,FALSTAFF,"fox, and for womanhood, Maid Marian may be the"
2134,Henry IV,45,3.2.297,FALSTAFF,"deputy's wife of the ward to thee. Go, you thing,"
2135,Henry IV,45,3.2.298,FALSTAFF,go
2136,Henry IV,46,3.2.299,Hostess,"Say, what thing? what thing?"
2137,Henry IV,47,3.2.300,FALSTAFF,"What thing! why, a thing to thank God on."
2138,Henry IV,48,3.2.301,Hostess,"I am no thing to thank God on, I would thou"
2139,Henry IV,48,3.2.302,Hostess,"shouldst know it, I am an honest man's wife: and,"
2140,Henry IV,48,3.2.303,Hostess,"setting thy knighthood aside, thou art a knave to"
2141,Henry IV,48,3.2.304,Hostess,call me so.
2142,Henry IV,49,3.2.305,FALSTAFF,"Setting thy womanhood aside, thou art a beast to say"
2143,Henry IV,49,3.2.306,FALSTAFF,otherwise.
2144,Henry IV,50,3.2.307,Hostess,"Say, what beast, thou knave, thou?"
2145,Henry IV,51,3.2.308,FALSTAFF,"What beast! why, an otter."
2146,Henry IV,52,3.2.309,PRINCE HENRY,"An otter, Sir John! Why an otter?"
2147,Henry IV,53,3.2.310,FALSTAFF,"Why, she's neither fish nor flesh, a man knows not"
2148,Henry IV,53,3.2.311,FALSTAFF,where to have her.
2149,Henry IV,54,3.2.312,Hostess,Thou art an unjust man in saying so: thou or any
2150,Henry IV,54,3.2.313,Hostess,"man knows where to have me, thou knave, thou!"
2151,Henry IV,55,3.2.314,PRINCE HENRY,"Thou sayest true, hostess, and he slanders thee most grossly."
2152,Henry IV,56,3.2.315,Hostess,"So he doth you, my lord, and said this other day you"
2153,Henry IV,56,3.2.316,Hostess,ought him a thousand pound.
2154,Henry IV,57,3.2.317,PRINCE HENRY,"Sirrah, do I owe you a thousand pound?"
2155,Henry IV,58,3.2.318,FALSTAFF,"A thousand pound, Ha! a million: thy love is worth"
2156,Henry IV,58,3.2.319,FALSTAFF,a million: thou owest me thy love.
2157,Henry IV,59,3.2.320,Hostess,"Nay, my lord, he called you Jack, and said he would"
2158,Henry IV,59,3.2.321,Hostess,cudgel you.
2159,Henry IV,60,3.2.322,FALSTAFF,"Did I, Bardolph?"
2160,Henry IV,61,3.2.323,BARDOLPH,"Indeed, Sir John, you said so."
2161,Henry IV,62,3.2.324,FALSTAFF,"Yea, if he said my ring was copper."
2162,Henry IV,63,3.2.325,PRINCE HENRY,I say 'tis copper: darest thou be as good as thy word now?
2163,Henry IV,64,3.2.326,FALSTAFF,"Why, Hal, thou knowest, as thou art but man, I dare:"
2164,Henry IV,64,3.2.327,FALSTAFF,"but as thou art prince, I fear thee as I fear the"
2165,Henry IV,64,3.2.328,FALSTAFF,roaring of a lion's whelp.
2166,Henry IV,65,3.2.329,PRINCE HENRY,And why not as the lion?
2167,Henry IV,66,3.2.330,FALSTAFF,The king is to be feared as the lion: dost thou
2168,Henry IV,66,3.2.331,FALSTAFF,"think I'll fear thee as I fear thy father? nay, an"
2169,Henry IV,66,3.2.332,FALSTAFF,"I do, I pray God my girdle break."
2170,Henry IV,67,3.2.333,PRINCE HENRY,"O, if it should, how would thy guts fall about thy"
2171,Henry IV,67,3.2.334,PRINCE HENRY,"knees! But, sirrah, there's no room for faith,"
2172,Henry IV,67,3.2.335,PRINCE HENRY,"truth, nor honesty in this bosom of thine, it is all"
2173,Henry IV,67,3.2.336,PRINCE HENRY,filled up with guts and midriff. Charge an honest
2174,Henry IV,67,3.2.337,PRINCE HENRY,"woman with picking thy pocket! why, thou whoreson,"
2175,Henry IV,67,3.2.338,PRINCE HENRY,"impudent, embossed rascal, if there were anything in"
2176,Henry IV,67,3.2.339,PRINCE HENRY,"thy pocket but tavern-reckonings, memorandums of"
2177,Henry IV,67,3.2.340,PRINCE HENRY,"bawdy-houses, and one poor penny-worth of"
2178,Henry IV,67,3.2.341,PRINCE HENRY,"sugar-candy to make thee long-winded, if thy pocket"
2179,Henry IV,67,3.2.342,PRINCE HENRY,"were enriched with any other injuries but these, I"
2180,Henry IV,67,3.2.343,PRINCE HENRY,"am a villain: and yet you will stand to if, you will"
2181,Henry IV,67,3.2.344,PRINCE HENRY,not pocket up wrong: art thou not ashamed?
2182,Henry IV,68,3.2.345,FALSTAFF,"Dost thou hear, Hal? thou knowest in the state of"
2183,Henry IV,68,3.2.346,FALSTAFF,"innocency Adam fell, and what should poor Jack"
2184,Henry IV,68,3.2.347,FALSTAFF,Falstaff do in the days of villany? Thou seest I
2185,Henry IV,68,3.2.348,FALSTAFF,"have more flesh than another man, and therefore more"
2186,Henry IV,68,3.2.349,FALSTAFF,"frailty. You confess then, you picked my pocket?"
2187,Henry IV,69,3.2.350,PRINCE HENRY,It appears so by the story.
2188,Henry IV,70,3.2.351,FALSTAFF,"Hostess, I forgive thee: go, make ready breakfast,"
2189,Henry IV,70,3.2.352,FALSTAFF,"love thy husband, look to thy servants, cherish thy"
2190,Henry IV,70,3.2.353,FALSTAFF,guests: thou shalt find me tractable to any honest
2191,Henry IV,70,3.2.354,FALSTAFF,"reason: thou seest I am pacified still. Nay,"
2192,Henry IV,70,3.2.355,FALSTAFF,"prithee, be gone."
2193,Henry IV,70,,FALSTAFF,Exit Hostess
2194,Henry IV,70,3.2.356,FALSTAFF,"Now Hal, to the news at court: for the robbery,"
2195,Henry IV,70,3.2.357,FALSTAFF,"lad, how is that answered?"
2196,Henry IV,71,3.2.358,PRINCE HENRY,"O, my sweet beef, I must still be good angel to"
2197,Henry IV,71,3.2.359,PRINCE HENRY,thee: the money is paid back again.
2198,Henry IV,72,3.2.360,FALSTAFF,"O, I do not like that paying back, 'tis a double labour."
2199,Henry IV,73,3.2.361,PRINCE HENRY,I am good friends with my father and may do any thing.
2200,Henry IV,74,3.2.362,FALSTAFF,"Rob me the exchequer the first thing thou doest, and"
2201,Henry IV,74,3.2.363,FALSTAFF,do it with unwashed hands too.
2202,Henry IV,75,3.2.364,BARDOLPH,"Do, my lord."
2203,Henry IV,76,3.2.365,PRINCE HENRY,"I have procured thee, Jack, a charge of foot."
2204,Henry IV,77,3.2.366,FALSTAFF,I would it had been of horse. Where shall I find
2205,Henry IV,77,3.2.367,FALSTAFF,"one that can steal well? O for a fine thief, of the"
2206,Henry IV,77,3.2.368,FALSTAFF,age of two and twenty or thereabouts! I am
2207,Henry IV,77,3.2.369,FALSTAFF,"heinously unprovided. Well, God be thanked for"
2208,Henry IV,77,3.2.370,FALSTAFF,"these rebels, they offend none but the virtuous: I"
2209,Henry IV,77,3.2.371,FALSTAFF,"laud them, I praise them."
2210,Henry IV,78,3.2.372,PRINCE HENRY,Bardolph!
2211,Henry IV,79,3.2.373,BARDOLPH,My lord?
2212,Henry IV,80,3.2.374,PRINCE HENRY,"Go bear this letter to Lord John of Lancaster, to my"
2213,Henry IV,80,3.2.375,PRINCE HENRY,"brother John, this to my Lord of Westmoreland."
2214,Henry IV,80,,PRINCE HENRY,Exit Bardolph
2215,Henry IV,80,3.2.376,PRINCE HENRY,"Go, Peto, to horse, to horse, for thou and I have"
2216,Henry IV,80,3.2.377,PRINCE HENRY,thirty miles to ride yet ere dinner time.
2217,Henry IV,80,,PRINCE HENRY,Exit Peto
2218,Henry IV,80,3.2.378,PRINCE HENRY,"Jack, meet me to-morrow in the temple hall at two"
2219,Henry IV,80,3.2.379,PRINCE HENRY,o'clock in the afternoon.
2220,Henry IV,80,3.2.380,PRINCE HENRY,"There shalt thou know thy charge, and there receive"
2221,Henry IV,80,3.2.381,PRINCE HENRY,Money and order for their furniture.
2222,Henry IV,80,3.2.382,PRINCE HENRY,"The land is burning, Percy stands on high,"
2223,Henry IV,80,3.2.383,PRINCE HENRY,And either we or they must lower lie.
2224,Henry IV,80,,PRINCE HENRY,Exit PRINCE HENRY
2225,Henry IV,81,3.2.384,FALSTAFF,"Rare words! brave world! Hostess, my breakfast, come!"
2226,Henry IV,81,3.2.385,FALSTAFF,"O, I could wish this tavern were my drum!"
2227,Henry IV,81,,FALSTAFF,Exit
2228,Henry IV,81,,FALSTAFF,ACT IV
2229,Henry IV,81,,FALSTAFF,SCENE I. The rebel camp near Shrewsbury.
2230,Henry IV,81,,FALSTAFF,"Enter HOTSPUR, WORCESTER, and DOUGLAS"
2231,Henry IV,1,4.1.1,HOTSPUR,"Well said, my noble Scot: if speaking truth"
2232,Henry IV,1,4.1.2,HOTSPUR,"In this fine age were not thought flattery,"
2233,Henry IV,1,4.1.3,HOTSPUR,"Such attribution should the Douglas have,"
2234,Henry IV,1,4.1.4,HOTSPUR,As not a soldier of this season's stamp
2235,Henry IV,1,4.1.5,HOTSPUR,Should go so general current through the world.
2236,Henry IV,1,4.1.6,HOTSPUR,"By God, I cannot flatter, I do defy"
2237,Henry IV,1,4.1.7,HOTSPUR,"The tongues of soothers, but a braver place"
2238,Henry IV,1,4.1.8,HOTSPUR,In my heart's love hath no man than yourself:
2239,Henry IV,1,4.1.9,HOTSPUR,"Nay, task me to my word, approve me, lord."
2240,Henry IV,2,4.1.10,EARL OF DOUGLAS,Thou art the king of honour:
2241,Henry IV,2,4.1.11,EARL OF DOUGLAS,No man so potent breathes upon the ground
2242,Henry IV,2,4.1.12,EARL OF DOUGLAS,But I will beard him.
2243,Henry IV,3,4.1.13,HOTSPUR,"Do so, and 'tis well."
2244,Henry IV,3,,HOTSPUR,Enter a Messenger with letters
2245,Henry IV,3,4.1.14,HOTSPUR,What letters hast thou there?--I can but thank you.
2246,Henry IV,4,4.1.15,Messenger,These letters come from your father.
2247,Henry IV,5,4.1.16,HOTSPUR,Letters from him! why comes he not himself?
2248,Henry IV,6,4.1.17,Messenger,"He cannot come, my lord, he is grievous sick."
2249,Henry IV,7,4.1.18,HOTSPUR,'Zounds! how has he the leisure to be sick
2250,Henry IV,7,4.1.19,HOTSPUR,In such a rustling time? Who leads his power?
2251,Henry IV,7,4.1.20,HOTSPUR,Under whose government come they along?
2252,Henry IV,8,4.1.21,Messenger,"His letters bear his mind, not I, my lord."
2253,Henry IV,9,4.1.22,EARL OF WORCESTER,"I prithee, tell me, doth he keep his bed?"
2254,Henry IV,10,4.1.23,Messenger,"He did, my lord, four days ere I set forth,"
2255,Henry IV,10,4.1.24,Messenger,And at the time of my departure thence
2256,Henry IV,10,4.1.25,Messenger,He was much fear'd by his physicians.
2257,Henry IV,11,4.1.26,EARL OF WORCESTER,I would the state of time had first been whole
2258,Henry IV,11,4.1.27,EARL OF WORCESTER,Ere he by sickness had been visited:
2259,Henry IV,11,4.1.28,EARL OF WORCESTER,His health was never better worth than now.
2260,Henry IV,12,4.1.29,HOTSPUR,Sick now! droop now! this sickness doth infect
2261,Henry IV,12,4.1.30,HOTSPUR,"The very life-blood of our enterprise,"
2262,Henry IV,12,4.1.31,HOTSPUR,"'Tis catching hither, even to our camp."
2263,Henry IV,12,4.1.32,HOTSPUR,"He writes me here, that inward sickness--"
2264,Henry IV,12,4.1.33,HOTSPUR,And that his friends by deputation could not
2265,Henry IV,12,4.1.34,HOTSPUR,"So soon be drawn, nor did he think it meet"
2266,Henry IV,12,4.1.35,HOTSPUR,To lay so dangerous and dear a trust
2267,Henry IV,12,4.1.36,HOTSPUR,On any soul removed but on his own.
2268,Henry IV,12,4.1.37,HOTSPUR,"Yet doth he give us bold advertisement,"
2269,Henry IV,12,4.1.38,HOTSPUR,"That with our small conjunction we should on,"
2270,Henry IV,12,4.1.39,HOTSPUR,"To see how fortune is disposed to us,"
2271,Henry IV,12,4.1.40,HOTSPUR,"For, as he writes, there is no quailing now."
2272,Henry IV,12,4.1.41,HOTSPUR,Because the king is certainly possess'd
2273,Henry IV,12,4.1.42,HOTSPUR,Of all our purposes. What say you to it?
2274,Henry IV,13,4.1.43,EARL OF WORCESTER,Your father's sickness is a maim to us.
2275,Henry IV,14,4.1.44,HOTSPUR,"A perilous gash, a very limb lopp'd off:"
2276,Henry IV,14,4.1.45,HOTSPUR,"And yet, in faith, it is not, his present want"
2277,Henry IV,14,4.1.46,HOTSPUR,Seems more than we shall find it: were it good
2278,Henry IV,14,4.1.47,HOTSPUR,To set the exact wealth of all our states
2279,Henry IV,14,4.1.48,HOTSPUR,All at one cast? to set so rich a main
2280,Henry IV,14,4.1.49,HOTSPUR,On the nice hazard of one doubtful hour?
2281,Henry IV,14,4.1.50,HOTSPUR,"It were not good, for therein should we read"
2282,Henry IV,14,4.1.51,HOTSPUR,"The very bottom and the soul of hope,"
2283,Henry IV,14,4.1.52,HOTSPUR,"The very list, the very utmost bound"
2284,Henry IV,14,4.1.53,HOTSPUR,Of all our fortunes.
2285,Henry IV,15,4.1.54,EARL OF DOUGLAS,"'Faith, and so we should,"
2286,Henry IV,15,4.1.55,EARL OF DOUGLAS,Where now remains a sweet reversion:
2287,Henry IV,15,4.1.56,EARL OF DOUGLAS,We may boldly spend upon the hope of what
2288,Henry IV,15,4.1.57,EARL OF DOUGLAS,Is to come in:
2289,Henry IV,15,4.1.58,EARL OF DOUGLAS,A comfort of retirement lives in this.
2290,Henry IV,16,4.1.59,HOTSPUR,"A rendezvous, a home to fly unto."
2291,Henry IV,16,4.1.60,HOTSPUR,If that the devil and mischance look big
2292,Henry IV,16,4.1.61,HOTSPUR,Upon the maidenhead of our affairs.
2293,Henry IV,17,4.1.62,EARL OF WORCESTER,But yet I would your father had been here.
2294,Henry IV,17,4.1.63,EARL OF WORCESTER,The quality and hair of our attempt
2295,Henry IV,17,4.1.64,EARL OF WORCESTER,Brooks no division: it will be thought
2296,Henry IV,17,4.1.65,EARL OF WORCESTER,"By some, that know not why he is away,"
2297,Henry IV,17,4.1.66,EARL OF WORCESTER,"That wisdom, loyalty and mere dislike"
2298,Henry IV,17,4.1.67,EARL OF WORCESTER,Of our proceedings kept the earl from hence:
2299,Henry IV,17,4.1.68,EARL OF WORCESTER,And think how such an apprehension
2300,Henry IV,17,4.1.69,EARL OF WORCESTER,May turn the tide of fearful faction
2301,Henry IV,17,4.1.70,EARL OF WORCESTER,"And breed a kind of question in our cause,"
2302,Henry IV,17,4.1.71,EARL OF WORCESTER,For well you know we of the offering side
2303,Henry IV,17,4.1.72,EARL OF WORCESTER,"Must keep aloof from strict arbitrement,"
2304,Henry IV,17,4.1.73,EARL OF WORCESTER,"And stop all sight-holes, every loop from whence"
2305,Henry IV,17,4.1.74,EARL OF WORCESTER,The eye of reason may pry in upon us:
2306,Henry IV,17,4.1.75,EARL OF WORCESTER,"This absence of your father's draws a curtain,"
2307,Henry IV,17,4.1.76,EARL OF WORCESTER,That shows the ignorant a kind of fear
2308,Henry IV,17,4.1.77,EARL OF WORCESTER,Before not dreamt of.
2309,Henry IV,18,4.1.78,HOTSPUR,You strain too far.
2310,Henry IV,18,4.1.79,HOTSPUR,I rather of his absence make this use:
2311,Henry IV,18,4.1.80,HOTSPUR,"It lends a lustre and more great opinion,"
2312,Henry IV,18,4.1.81,HOTSPUR,"A larger dare to our great enterprise,"
2313,Henry IV,18,4.1.82,HOTSPUR,"Than if the earl were here, for men must think,"
2314,Henry IV,18,4.1.83,HOTSPUR,If we without his help can make a head
2315,Henry IV,18,4.1.84,HOTSPUR,"To push against a kingdom, with his help"
2316,Henry IV,18,4.1.85,HOTSPUR,We shall o'erturn it topsy-turvy down.
2317,Henry IV,18,4.1.86,HOTSPUR,"Yet all goes well, yet all our joints are whole."
2318,Henry IV,19,4.1.87,EARL OF DOUGLAS,As heart can think: there is not such a word
2319,Henry IV,19,4.1.88,EARL OF DOUGLAS,Spoke of in Scotland as this term of fear.
2320,Henry IV,19,,EARL OF DOUGLAS,Enter SIR RICHARD VERNON
2321,Henry IV,20,4.1.89,HOTSPUR,"My cousin Vernon, welcome, by my soul."
2322,Henry IV,21,4.1.90,VERNON,"Pray God my news be worth a welcome, lord."
2323,Henry IV,21,4.1.91,VERNON,"The Earl of Westmoreland, seven thousand strong,"
2324,Henry IV,21,4.1.92,VERNON,"Is marching hitherwards, with him Prince John."
2325,Henry IV,22,4.1.93,HOTSPUR,No harm: what more?
2326,Henry IV,23,4.1.94,VERNON,"And further, I have learn'd,"
2327,Henry IV,23,4.1.95,VERNON,"The king himself in person is set forth,"
2328,Henry IV,23,4.1.96,VERNON,"Or hitherwards intended speedily,"
2329,Henry IV,23,4.1.97,VERNON,With strong and mighty preparation.
2330,Henry IV,24,4.1.98,HOTSPUR,"He shall be welcome too. Where is his son,"
2331,Henry IV,24,4.1.99,HOTSPUR,"The nimble-footed madcap Prince of Wales,"
2332,Henry IV,24,4.1.100,HOTSPUR,"And his comrades, that daff'd the world aside,"
2333,Henry IV,24,4.1.101,HOTSPUR,And bid it pass?
2334,Henry IV,25,4.1.102,VERNON,"All furnish'd, all in arms,"
2335,Henry IV,25,4.1.103,VERNON,All plumed like estridges that with the wind
2336,Henry IV,25,4.1.104,VERNON,"Baited like eagles having lately bathed,"
2337,Henry IV,25,4.1.105,VERNON,"Glittering in golden coats, like images,"
2338,Henry IV,25,4.1.106,VERNON,"As full of spirit as the month of May,"
2339,Henry IV,25,4.1.107,VERNON,"And gorgeous as the sun at midsummer,"
2340,Henry IV,25,4.1.108,VERNON,"Wanton as youthful goats, wild as young bulls."
2341,Henry IV,25,4.1.109,VERNON,"I saw young Harry, with his beaver on,"
2342,Henry IV,25,4.1.110,VERNON,"His cuisses on his thighs, gallantly arm'd"
2343,Henry IV,25,4.1.111,VERNON,"Rise from the ground like feather'd Mercury,"
2344,Henry IV,25,4.1.112,VERNON,"And vaulted with such ease into his seat,"
2345,Henry IV,25,4.1.113,VERNON,"As if an angel dropp'd down from the clouds,"
2346,Henry IV,25,4.1.114,VERNON,To turn and wind a fiery Pegasus
2347,Henry IV,25,4.1.115,VERNON,And witch the world with noble horsemanship.
2348,Henry IV,26,4.1.116,HOTSPUR,"No more, no more: worse than the sun in March,"
2349,Henry IV,26,4.1.117,HOTSPUR,This praise doth nourish agues. Let them come:
2350,Henry IV,26,4.1.118,HOTSPUR,"They come like sacrifices in their trim,"
2351,Henry IV,26,4.1.119,HOTSPUR,And to the fire-eyed maid of smoky war
2352,Henry IV,26,4.1.120,HOTSPUR,All hot and bleeding will we offer them:
2353,Henry IV,26,4.1.121,HOTSPUR,The mailed Mars shall on his altar sit
2354,Henry IV,26,4.1.122,HOTSPUR,Up to the ears in blood. I am on fire
2355,Henry IV,26,4.1.123,HOTSPUR,To hear this rich reprisal is so nigh
2356,Henry IV,26,4.1.124,HOTSPUR,"And yet not ours. Come, let me taste my horse,"
2357,Henry IV,26,4.1.125,HOTSPUR,Who is to bear me like a thunderbolt
2358,Henry IV,26,4.1.126,HOTSPUR,Against the bosom of the Prince of Wales:
2359,Henry IV,26,4.1.127,HOTSPUR,"Harry to Harry shall, hot horse to horse,"
2360,Henry IV,26,4.1.128,HOTSPUR,Meet and ne'er part till one drop down a corse.
2361,Henry IV,26,4.1.129,HOTSPUR,O that Glendower were come!
2362,Henry IV,27,4.1.130,VERNON,There is more news:
2363,Henry IV,27,4.1.131,VERNON,"I learn'd in Worcester, as I rode along,"
2364,Henry IV,27,4.1.132,VERNON,He cannot draw his power this fourteen days.
2365,Henry IV,28,4.1.133,EARL OF DOUGLAS,That's the worst tidings that I hear of yet.
2366,Henry IV,29,4.1.134,WORCESTER,"Ay, by my faith, that bears a frosty sound."
2367,Henry IV,30,4.1.135,HOTSPUR,What may the king's whole battle reach unto?
2368,Henry IV,31,4.1.136,VERNON,To thirty thousand.
2369,Henry IV,32,4.1.137,HOTSPUR,Forty let it be:
2370,Henry IV,32,4.1.138,HOTSPUR,"My father and Glendower being both away,"
2371,Henry IV,32,4.1.139,HOTSPUR,The powers of us may serve so great a day
2372,Henry IV,32,4.1.140,HOTSPUR,"Come, let us take a muster speedily:"
2373,Henry IV,32,4.1.141,HOTSPUR,"Doomsday is near, die all, die merrily."
2374,Henry IV,33,4.1.142,EARL OF DOUGLAS,Talk not of dying: I am out of fear
2375,Henry IV,33,4.1.143,EARL OF DOUGLAS,Of death or death's hand for this one-half year.
2376,Henry IV,33,,EARL OF DOUGLAS,Exeunt
2377,Henry IV,33,,EARL OF DOUGLAS,SCENE II. A public road near Coventry.
2378,Henry IV,33,,EARL OF DOUGLAS,Enter FALSTAFF and BARDOLPH
2379,Henry IV,1,4.2.1,FALSTAFF,"Bardolph, get thee before to Coventry, fill me a"
2380,Henry IV,1,4.2.2,FALSTAFF,"bottle of sack: our soldiers shall march through,"
2381,Henry IV,1,4.2.3,FALSTAFF,we'll to Sutton Co'fil' tonight.
2382,Henry IV,2,4.2.4,BARDOLPH,"Will you give me money, captain?"
2383,Henry IV,3,4.2.5,FALSTAFF,"Lay out, lay out."
2384,Henry IV,4,4.2.6,BARDOLPH,This bottle makes an angel.
2385,Henry IV,5,4.2.7,FALSTAFF,"An if it do, take it for thy labour, and if it make"
2386,Henry IV,5,4.2.8,FALSTAFF,"twenty, take them all, I'll answer the coinage. Bid"
2387,Henry IV,5,4.2.9,FALSTAFF,my lieutenant Peto meet me at town's end.
2388,Henry IV,6,4.2.10,BARDOLPH,"I will, captain: farewell."
2389,Henry IV,6,,BARDOLPH,Exit
2390,Henry IV,7,4.2.11,FALSTAFF,"If I be not ashamed of my soldiers, I am a soused"
2391,Henry IV,7,4.2.12,FALSTAFF,gurnet. I have misused the king's press damnably.
2392,Henry IV,7,4.2.13,FALSTAFF,"I have got, in exchange of a hundred and fifty"
2393,Henry IV,7,4.2.14,FALSTAFF,"soldiers, three hundred and odd pounds. I press me"
2394,Henry IV,7,4.2.15,FALSTAFF,"none but good house-holders, yeoman's sons, inquire"
2395,Henry IV,7,4.2.16,FALSTAFF,"me out contracted bachelors, such as had been asked"
2396,Henry IV,7,4.2.17,FALSTAFF,"twice on the banns, such a commodity of warm slaves,"
2397,Henry IV,7,4.2.18,FALSTAFF,"as had as lieve hear the devil as a drum, such as"
2398,Henry IV,7,4.2.19,FALSTAFF,fear the report of a caliver worse than a struck
2399,Henry IV,7,4.2.20,FALSTAFF,fowl or a hurt wild-duck. I pressed me none but such
2400,Henry IV,7,4.2.21,FALSTAFF,"toasts-and-butter, with hearts in their bellies no"
2401,Henry IV,7,4.2.22,FALSTAFF,"bigger than pins' heads, and they have bought out"
2402,Henry IV,7,4.2.23,FALSTAFF,"their services, and now my whole charge consists of"
2403,Henry IV,7,4.2.24,FALSTAFF,"ancients, corporals, lieutenants, gentlemen of"
2404,Henry IV,7,4.2.25,FALSTAFF,"companies, slaves as ragged as Lazarus in the"
2405,Henry IV,7,4.2.26,FALSTAFF,"painted cloth, where the glutton's dogs licked his"
2406,Henry IV,7,4.2.27,FALSTAFF,"sores, and such as indeed were never soldiers, but"
2407,Henry IV,7,4.2.28,FALSTAFF,"discarded unjust serving-men, younger sons to"
2408,Henry IV,7,4.2.29,FALSTAFF,"younger brothers, revolted tapsters and ostlers"
2409,Henry IV,7,4.2.30,FALSTAFF,"trade-fallen, the cankers of a calm world and a"
2410,Henry IV,7,4.2.31,FALSTAFF,"long peace, ten times more dishonourable ragged than"
2411,Henry IV,7,4.2.32,FALSTAFF,"an old faced ancient: and such have I, to fill up"
2412,Henry IV,7,4.2.33,FALSTAFF,the rooms of them that have bought out their
2413,Henry IV,7,4.2.34,FALSTAFF,"services, that you would think that I had a hundred"
2414,Henry IV,7,4.2.35,FALSTAFF,and fifty tattered prodigals lately come from
2415,Henry IV,7,4.2.36,FALSTAFF,"swine-keeping, from eating draff and husks. A mad"
2416,Henry IV,7,4.2.37,FALSTAFF,fellow met me on the way and told me I had unloaded
2417,Henry IV,7,4.2.38,FALSTAFF,all the gibbets and pressed the dead bodies. No eye
2418,Henry IV,7,4.2.39,FALSTAFF,hath seen such scarecrows. I'll not march through
2419,Henry IV,7,4.2.40,FALSTAFF,"Coventry with them, that's flat: nay, and the"
2420,Henry IV,7,4.2.41,FALSTAFF,"villains march wide betwixt the legs, as if they had"
2421,Henry IV,7,4.2.42,FALSTAFF,"gyves on, for indeed I had the most of them out of"
2422,Henry IV,7,4.2.43,FALSTAFF,prison. There's but a shirt and a half in all my
2423,Henry IV,7,4.2.44,FALSTAFF,"company, and the half shirt is two napkins tacked"
2424,Henry IV,7,4.2.45,FALSTAFF,together and thrown over the shoulders like an
2425,Henry IV,7,4.2.46,FALSTAFF,"herald's coat without sleeves, and the shirt, to say"
2426,Henry IV,7,4.2.47,FALSTAFF,"the truth, stolen from my host at Saint Alban's, or"
2427,Henry IV,7,4.2.48,FALSTAFF,the red-nose innkeeper of Daventry. But that's all
2428,Henry IV,7,4.2.49,FALSTAFF,"one, they'll find linen enough on every hedge."
2429,Henry IV,7,,FALSTAFF,Enter the PRINCE and WESTMORELAND
2430,Henry IV,8,4.2.50,PRINCE HENRY,"How now, blown Jack! how now, quilt!"
2431,Henry IV,9,4.2.51,FALSTAFF,"What, Hal! how now, mad wag! what a devil dost thou"
2432,Henry IV,9,4.2.52,FALSTAFF,"in Warwickshire? My good Lord of Westmoreland, I"
2433,Henry IV,9,4.2.53,FALSTAFF,cry you mercy: I thought your honour had already been
2434,Henry IV,9,4.2.54,FALSTAFF,at Shrewsbury.
2435,Henry IV,10,4.2.55,WESTMORELAND,"Faith, Sir John,'tis more than time that I were"
2436,Henry IV,10,4.2.56,WESTMORELAND,"there, and you too, but my powers are there already."
2437,Henry IV,10,4.2.57,WESTMORELAND,"The king, I can tell you, looks for us all: we must"
2438,Henry IV,10,4.2.58,WESTMORELAND,away all night.
2439,Henry IV,11,4.2.59,FALSTAFF,"Tut, never fear me: I am as vigilant as a cat to"
2440,Henry IV,11,4.2.60,FALSTAFF,steal cream.
2441,Henry IV,12,4.2.61,PRINCE HENRY,"I think, to steal cream indeed, for thy theft hath"
2442,Henry IV,12,4.2.62,PRINCE HENRY,"already made thee butter. But tell me, Jack, whose"
2443,Henry IV,12,4.2.63,PRINCE HENRY,fellows are these that come after?
2444,Henry IV,13,4.2.64,FALSTAFF,"Mine, Hal, mine."
2445,Henry IV,14,4.2.65,PRINCE HENRY,I did never see such pitiful rascals.
2446,Henry IV,15,4.2.66,FALSTAFF,"Tut, tut, good enough to toss, food for powder, food"
2447,Henry IV,15,4.2.67,FALSTAFF,"for powder, they'll fill a pit as well as better:"
2448,Henry IV,15,4.2.68,FALSTAFF,"tush, man, mortal men, mortal men."
2449,Henry IV,16,4.2.69,WESTMORELAND,"Ay, but, Sir John, methinks they are exceeding poor"
2450,Henry IV,16,4.2.70,WESTMORELAND,"and bare, too beggarly."
2451,Henry IV,17,4.2.71,FALSTAFF,"'Faith, for their poverty, I know not where they had"
2452,Henry IV,17,4.2.72,FALSTAFF,"that, and for their bareness, I am sure they never"
2453,Henry IV,17,4.2.73,FALSTAFF,learned that of me.
2454,Henry IV,18,4.2.74,PRINCE HENRY,"No I'll be sworn, unless you call three fingers on"
2455,Henry IV,18,4.2.75,PRINCE HENRY,"the ribs bare. But, sirrah, make haste: Percy is"
2456,Henry IV,18,4.2.76,PRINCE HENRY,already in the field.
2457,Henry IV,19,4.2.77,FALSTAFF,"What, is the king encamped?"
2458,Henry IV,20,4.2.78,WESTMORELAND,"He is, Sir John: I fear we shall stay too long."
2459,Henry IV,21,4.2.79,FALSTAFF,"Well,"
2460,Henry IV,21,4.2.80,FALSTAFF,To the latter end of a fray and the beginning of a feast
2461,Henry IV,21,4.2.81,FALSTAFF,Fits a dull fighter and a keen guest.
2462,Henry IV,21,,FALSTAFF,Exeunt
2463,Henry IV,21,,FALSTAFF,SCENE III. The rebel camp near Shrewsbury.
2464,Henry IV,21,,FALSTAFF,"Enter HOTSPUR, WORCESTER, DOUGLAS, and VERNON"
2465,Henry IV,1,4.3.1,HOTSPUR,We'll fight with him to-night.
2466,Henry IV,2,4.3.2,EARL OF WORCESTER,It may not be.
2467,Henry IV,3,4.3.3,EARL OF DOUGLAS,You give him then the advantage.
2468,Henry IV,4,4.3.4,VERNON,Not a whit.
2469,Henry IV,5,4.3.5,HOTSPUR,Why say you so? looks he not for supply?
2470,Henry IV,6,4.3.6,VERNON,So do we.
2471,Henry IV,7,4.3.7,HOTSPUR,"His is certain, ours is doubtful."
2472,Henry IV,8,4.3.8,EARL OF WORCESTER,"Good cousin, be advised, stir not tonight."
2473,Henry IV,9,4.3.9,VERNON,"Do not, my lord."
2474,Henry IV,10,4.3.10,EARL OF DOUGLAS,You do not counsel well:
2475,Henry IV,10,4.3.11,EARL OF DOUGLAS,You speak it out of fear and cold heart.
2476,Henry IV,11,4.3.12,VERNON,"Do me no slander, Douglas: by my life,"
2477,Henry IV,11,4.3.13,VERNON,"And I dare well maintain it with my life,"
2478,Henry IV,11,4.3.14,VERNON,"If well-respected honour bid me on,"
2479,Henry IV,11,4.3.15,VERNON,I hold as little counsel with weak fear
2480,Henry IV,11,4.3.16,VERNON,"As you, my lord, or any Scot that this day lives:"
2481,Henry IV,11,4.3.17,VERNON,Let it be seen to-morrow in the battle
2482,Henry IV,11,4.3.18,VERNON,Which of us fears.
2483,Henry IV,12,4.3.19,EARL OF DOUGLAS,"Yea, or to-night."
2484,Henry IV,13,4.3.20,VERNON,Content.
2485,Henry IV,14,4.3.21,HOTSPUR,"To-night, say I."
2486,Henry IV,15,4.3.22,VERNON,"Come, come it nay not be. I wonder much,"
2487,Henry IV,15,4.3.23,VERNON,"Being men of such great leading as you are,"
2488,Henry IV,15,4.3.24,VERNON,That you foresee not what impediments
2489,Henry IV,15,4.3.25,VERNON,Drag back our expedition: certain horse
2490,Henry IV,15,4.3.26,VERNON,Of my cousin Vernon's are not yet come up:
2491,Henry IV,15,4.3.27,VERNON,"Your uncle Worcester's horse came but today,"
2492,Henry IV,15,4.3.28,VERNON,"And now their pride and mettle is asleep,"
2493,Henry IV,15,4.3.29,VERNON,"Their courage with hard labour tame and dull,"
2494,Henry IV,15,4.3.30,VERNON,That not a horse is half the half of himself.
2495,Henry IV,16,4.3.31,HOTSPUR,So are the horses of the enemy
2496,Henry IV,16,4.3.32,HOTSPUR,"In general, journey-bated and brought low:"
2497,Henry IV,16,4.3.33,HOTSPUR,The better part of ours are full of rest.
2498,Henry IV,17,4.3.34,EARL OF WORCESTER,The number of the king exceedeth ours:
2499,Henry IV,17,1.1.0,EARL OF WORCESTER,"For God's sake. cousin, stay till all come in."
2500,Henry IV,17,,EARL OF WORCESTER,The trumpet sounds a parley
2501,Henry IV,17,,EARL OF WORCESTER,Enter SIR WALTER BLUNT
2502,Henry IV,18,4.3.36,SIR WALTER BLUNT,"I come with gracious offers from the king,"
2503,Henry IV,18,4.3.37,SIR WALTER BLUNT,if you vouchsafe me hearing and respect.
2504,Henry IV,19,4.3.38,HOTSPUR,"Welcome, Sir Walter Blunt, and would to God"
2505,Henry IV,19,4.3.39,HOTSPUR,You were of our determination!
2506,Henry IV,19,4.3.40,HOTSPUR,"Some of us love you well, and even those some"
2507,Henry IV,19,4.3.41,HOTSPUR,"Envy your great deservings and good name,"
2508,Henry IV,19,4.3.42,HOTSPUR,"Because you are not of our quality,"
2509,Henry IV,19,4.3.43,HOTSPUR,But stand against us like an enemy.
2510,Henry IV,20,4.3.44,SIR WALTER BLUNT,"And God defend but still I should stand so,"
2511,Henry IV,20,4.3.45,SIR WALTER BLUNT,So long as out of limit and true rule
2512,Henry IV,20,4.3.46,SIR WALTER BLUNT,You stand against anointed majesty.
2513,Henry IV,20,4.3.47,SIR WALTER BLUNT,But to my charge. The king hath sent to know
2514,Henry IV,20,4.3.48,SIR WALTER BLUNT,"The nature of your griefs, and whereupon"
2515,Henry IV,20,4.3.49,SIR WALTER BLUNT,You conjure from the breast of civil peace
2516,Henry IV,20,4.3.50,SIR WALTER BLUNT,"Such bold hostility, teaching his duteous land"
2517,Henry IV,20,4.3.51,SIR WALTER BLUNT,Audacious cruelty. If that the king
2518,Henry IV,20,4.3.52,SIR WALTER BLUNT,"Have any way your good deserts forgot,"
2519,Henry IV,20,4.3.53,SIR WALTER BLUNT,"Which he confesseth to be manifold,"
2520,Henry IV,20,4.3.54,SIR WALTER BLUNT,"He bids you name your griefs, and with all speed"
2521,Henry IV,20,4.3.55,SIR WALTER BLUNT,You shall have your desires with interest
2522,Henry IV,20,4.3.56,SIR WALTER BLUNT,And pardon absolute for yourself and these
2523,Henry IV,20,4.3.57,SIR WALTER BLUNT,Herein misled by your suggestion.
2524,Henry IV,21,4.3.58,HOTSPUR,"The king is kind, and well we know the king"
2525,Henry IV,21,4.3.59,HOTSPUR,"Knows at what time to promise, when to pay."
2526,Henry IV,21,4.3.60,HOTSPUR,My father and my uncle and myself
2527,Henry IV,21,4.3.61,HOTSPUR,"Did give him that same royalty he wears,"
2528,Henry IV,21,4.3.62,HOTSPUR,"And when he was not six and twenty strong,"
2529,Henry IV,21,4.3.63,HOTSPUR,"Sick in the world's regard, wretched and low,"
2530,Henry IV,21,4.3.64,HOTSPUR,"A poor unminded outlaw sneaking home,"
2531,Henry IV,21,4.3.65,HOTSPUR,"My father gave him welcome to the shore,"
2532,Henry IV,21,4.3.66,HOTSPUR,And when he heard him swear and vow to God
2533,Henry IV,21,4.3.67,HOTSPUR,"He came but to be Duke of Lancaster,"
2534,Henry IV,21,4.3.68,HOTSPUR,"To sue his livery and beg his peace,"
2535,Henry IV,21,4.3.69,HOTSPUR,"With tears of innocency and terms of zeal,"
2536,Henry IV,21,4.3.70,HOTSPUR,"My father, in kind heart and pity moved,"
2537,Henry IV,21,4.3.71,HOTSPUR,Swore him assistance and perform'd it too.
2538,Henry IV,21,4.3.72,HOTSPUR,Now when the lords and barons of the realm
2539,Henry IV,21,4.3.73,HOTSPUR,"Perceived Northumberland did lean to him,"
2540,Henry IV,21,4.3.74,HOTSPUR,"The more and less came in with cap and knee,"
2541,Henry IV,21,4.3.75,HOTSPUR,"Met him in boroughs, cities, villages,"
2542,Henry IV,21,4.3.76,HOTSPUR,"Attended him on bridges, stood in lanes,"
2543,Henry IV,21,4.3.77,HOTSPUR,"Laid gifts before him, proffer'd him their oaths,"
2544,Henry IV,21,4.3.78,HOTSPUR,"Gave him their heirs, as pages follow'd him"
2545,Henry IV,21,4.3.79,HOTSPUR,Even at the heels in golden multitudes.
2546,Henry IV,21,4.3.80,HOTSPUR,"He presently, as greatness knows itself,"
2547,Henry IV,21,4.3.81,HOTSPUR,Steps me a little higher than his vow
2548,Henry IV,21,4.3.82,HOTSPUR,"Made to my father, while his blood was poor,"
2549,Henry IV,21,4.3.83,HOTSPUR,"Upon the naked shore at Ravenspurgh,"
2550,Henry IV,21,4.3.84,HOTSPUR,"And now, forsooth, takes on him to reform"
2551,Henry IV,21,4.3.85,HOTSPUR,Some certain edicts and some strait decrees
2552,Henry IV,21,4.3.86,HOTSPUR,"That lie too heavy on the commonwealth,"
2553,Henry IV,21,4.3.87,HOTSPUR,"Cries out upon abuses, seems to weep"
2554,Henry IV,21,4.3.88,HOTSPUR,"Over his country's wrongs, and by this face,"
2555,Henry IV,21,4.3.89,HOTSPUR,"This seeming brow of justice, did he win"
2556,Henry IV,21,4.3.90,HOTSPUR,"The hearts of all that he did angle for,"
2557,Henry IV,21,4.3.91,HOTSPUR,"Proceeded further, cut me off the heads"
2558,Henry IV,21,4.3.92,HOTSPUR,Of all the favourites that the absent king
2559,Henry IV,21,4.3.93,HOTSPUR,"In deputation left behind him here,"
2560,Henry IV,21,4.3.94,HOTSPUR,When he was personal in the Irish war.
2561,Henry IV,22,4.3.95,SIR WALTER BLUNT,"Tut, I came not to hear this."
2562,Henry IV,23,4.3.96,HOTSPUR,Then to the point.
2563,Henry IV,23,4.3.97,HOTSPUR,"In short time after, he deposed the king,"
2564,Henry IV,23,4.3.98,HOTSPUR,"Soon after that, deprived him of his life,"
2565,Henry IV,23,4.3.99,HOTSPUR,"And in the neck of that, task'd the whole state:"
2566,Henry IV,23,4.3.100,HOTSPUR,"To make that worse, suffer'd his kinsman March,"
2567,Henry IV,23,4.3.101,HOTSPUR,"Who is, if every owner were well placed,"
2568,Henry IV,23,4.3.102,HOTSPUR,"Indeed his king, to be engaged in Wales,"
2569,Henry IV,23,4.3.103,HOTSPUR,"There without ransom to lie forfeited,"
2570,Henry IV,23,4.3.104,HOTSPUR,"Disgraced me in my happy victories,"
2571,Henry IV,23,4.3.105,HOTSPUR,"Sought to entrap me by intelligence,"
2572,Henry IV,23,4.3.106,HOTSPUR,"Rated mine uncle from the council-board,"
2573,Henry IV,23,4.3.107,HOTSPUR,"In rage dismiss'd my father from the court,"
2574,Henry IV,23,4.3.108,HOTSPUR,"Broke oath on oath, committed wrong on wrong,"
2575,Henry IV,23,4.3.109,HOTSPUR,And in conclusion drove us to seek out
2576,Henry IV,23,4.3.110,HOTSPUR,"This head of safety, and withal to pry"
2577,Henry IV,23,4.3.111,HOTSPUR,"Into his title, the which we find"
2578,Henry IV,23,4.3.112,HOTSPUR,Too indirect for long continuance.
2579,Henry IV,24,4.3.113,SIR WALTER BLUNT,Shall I return this answer to the king?
2580,Henry IV,25,4.3.114,HOTSPUR,"Not so, Sir Walter: we'll withdraw awhile."
2581,Henry IV,25,4.3.115,HOTSPUR,"Go to the king, and let there be impawn'd"
2582,Henry IV,25,4.3.116,HOTSPUR,"Some surety for a safe return again,"
2583,Henry IV,25,4.3.117,HOTSPUR,And in the morning early shall my uncle
2584,Henry IV,25,4.3.118,HOTSPUR,Bring him our purposes: and so farewell.
2585,Henry IV,26,4.3.119,SIR WALTER BLUNT,I would you would accept of grace and love.
2586,Henry IV,27,4.3.120,HOTSPUR,And may be so we shall.
2587,Henry IV,28,4.3.121,SIR WALTER BLUNT,Pray God you do.
2588,Henry IV,28,,SIR WALTER BLUNT,Exeunt
2589,Henry IV,28,,SIR WALTER BLUNT,SCENE IV. York. The ARCHBISHOP'S palace.
2590,Henry IV,28,,SIR WALTER BLUNT,Enter the ARCHBISHOP OF YORK and SIR MICHAEL
2591,Henry IV,1,4.4.1,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"Hie, good Sir Michael, bear this sealed brief"
2592,Henry IV,1,4.4.2,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"With winged haste to the lord marshal,"
2593,Henry IV,1,4.4.3,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"This to my cousin Scroop, and all the rest"
2594,Henry IV,1,4.4.4,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,To whom they are directed. If you knew
2595,Henry IV,1,4.4.5,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"How much they do to import, you would make haste."
2596,Henry IV,2,4.4.6,SIR MICHAEL,"My good lord,"
2597,Henry IV,2,4.4.7,SIR MICHAEL,I guess their tenor.
2598,Henry IV,3,4.4.8,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,Like enough you do.
2599,Henry IV,3,4.4.9,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"To-morrow, good Sir Michael, is a day"
2600,Henry IV,3,4.4.10,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,Wherein the fortune of ten thousand men
2601,Henry IV,3,4.4.11,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"Must bide the touch, for, sir, at Shrewsbury,"
2602,Henry IV,3,4.4.12,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"As I am truly given to understand,"
2603,Henry IV,3,4.4.13,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,The king with mighty and quick-raised power
2604,Henry IV,3,4.4.14,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"Meets with Lord Harry: and, I fear, Sir Michael,"
2605,Henry IV,3,4.4.15,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"What with the sickness of Northumberland,"
2606,Henry IV,3,4.4.16,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"Whose power was in the first proportion,"
2607,Henry IV,3,4.4.17,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"And what with Owen Glendower's absence thence,"
2608,Henry IV,3,4.4.18,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,Who with them was a rated sinew too
2609,Henry IV,3,4.4.19,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"And comes not in, o'er-ruled by prophecies,"
2610,Henry IV,3,4.4.20,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,I fear the power of Percy is too weak
2611,Henry IV,3,4.4.21,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,To wage an instant trial with the king.
2612,Henry IV,4,4.4.22,SIR MICHAEL,"Why, my good lord, you need not fear,"
2613,Henry IV,4,4.4.23,SIR MICHAEL,There is Douglas and Lord Mortimer.
2614,Henry IV,5,4.4.24,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"No, Mortimer is not there."
2615,Henry IV,6,4.4.25,SIR MICHAEL,"But there is Mordake, Vernon, Lord Harry Percy,"
2616,Henry IV,6,4.4.26,SIR MICHAEL,And there is my Lord of Worcester and a head
2617,Henry IV,6,4.4.27,SIR MICHAEL,"Of gallant warriors, noble gentlemen."
2618,Henry IV,7,4.4.28,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,And so there is: but yet the king hath drawn
2619,Henry IV,7,4.4.29,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,The special head of all the land together:
2620,Henry IV,7,4.4.30,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"The Prince of Wales, Lord John of Lancaster,"
2621,Henry IV,7,4.4.31,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"The noble Westmoreland and warlike Blunt,"
2622,Henry IV,7,4.4.32,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,And moe corrivals and dear men
2623,Henry IV,7,4.4.33,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,Of estimation and command in arms.
2624,Henry IV,8,4.4.34,SIR MICHAEL,"Doubt not, my lord, they shall be well opposed."
2625,Henry IV,9,4.4.35,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"I hope no less, yet needful 'tis to fear,"
2626,Henry IV,9,4.4.36,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"And, to prevent the worst, Sir Michael, speed:"
2627,Henry IV,9,4.4.37,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"For if Lord Percy thrive not, ere the king"
2628,Henry IV,9,4.4.38,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"Dismiss his power, he means to visit us,"
2629,Henry IV,9,4.4.39,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"For he hath heard of our confederacy,"
2630,Henry IV,9,4.4.40,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,And 'tis but wisdom to make strong against him:
2631,Henry IV,9,4.4.41,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,Therefore make haste. I must go write again
2632,Henry IV,9,4.4.42,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"To other friends, and so farewell, Sir Michael."
2633,Henry IV,9,,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,Exeunt
2634,Henry IV,9,,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,ACT V
2635,Henry IV,9,,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,SCENE I. KING HENRY IV's camp near Shrewsbury.
2636,Henry IV,9,,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"Enter KING HENRY, PRINCE HENRY, Lord John of  LANCASTER, EARL OF WESTMORELAND, SIR WALTER BLUNT, and FALSTAFF"
2637,Henry IV,1,5.1.1,KING HENRY IV,How bloodily the sun begins to peer
2638,Henry IV,1,5.1.2,KING HENRY IV,Above yon busky hill! the day looks pale
2639,Henry IV,1,5.1.3,KING HENRY IV,At his distemperature.
2640,Henry IV,2,5.1.4,PRINCE HENRY,The southern wind
2641,Henry IV,2,5.1.5,PRINCE HENRY,"Doth play the trumpet to his purposes,"
2642,Henry IV,2,5.1.6,PRINCE HENRY,And by his hollow whistling in the leaves
2643,Henry IV,2,5.1.7,PRINCE HENRY,Foretells a tempest and a blustering day.
2644,Henry IV,3,5.1.8,KING HENRY IV,"Then with the losers let it sympathize,"
2645,Henry IV,3,5.1.9,KING HENRY IV,For nothing can seem foul to those that win.
2646,Henry IV,3,,KING HENRY IV,The trumpet sounds
2647,Henry IV,3,,KING HENRY IV,Enter WORCESTER and VERNON
2648,Henry IV,3,5.1.10,KING HENRY IV,"How now, my Lord of Worcester! 'tis not well"
2649,Henry IV,3,5.1.11,KING HENRY IV,That you and I should meet upon such terms
2650,Henry IV,3,5.1.12,KING HENRY IV,"As now we meet. You have deceived our trust,"
2651,Henry IV,3,5.1.13,KING HENRY IV,"And made us doff our easy robes of peace,"
2652,Henry IV,3,5.1.14,KING HENRY IV,To crush our old limbs in ungentle steel:
2653,Henry IV,3,5.1.15,KING HENRY IV,"This is not well, my lord, this is not well."
2654,Henry IV,3,5.1.16,KING HENRY IV,What say you to it? will you again unknit
2655,Henry IV,3,5.1.17,KING HENRY IV,This curlish knot of all-abhorred war?
2656,Henry IV,3,5.1.18,KING HENRY IV,And move in that obedient orb again
2657,Henry IV,3,5.1.19,KING HENRY IV,"Where you did give a fair and natural light,"
2658,Henry IV,3,5.1.20,KING HENRY IV,"And be no more an exhaled meteor,"
2659,Henry IV,3,5.1.21,KING HENRY IV,A prodigy of fear and a portent
2660,Henry IV,3,5.1.22,KING HENRY IV,Of broached mischief to the unborn times?
2661,Henry IV,4,5.1.23,EARL OF WORCESTER,"Hear me, my liege:"
2662,Henry IV,4,5.1.24,EARL OF WORCESTER,"For mine own part, I could be well content"
2663,Henry IV,4,5.1.25,EARL OF WORCESTER,To entertain the lag-end of my life
2664,Henry IV,4,5.1.26,EARL OF WORCESTER,"With quiet hours, for I do protest,"
2665,Henry IV,4,5.1.27,EARL OF WORCESTER,I have not sought the day of this dislike.
2666,Henry IV,5,5.1.28,KING HENRY IV,"You have not sought it! how comes it, then?"
2667,Henry IV,6,5.1.29,FALSTAFF,"Rebellion lay in his way, and he found it."
2668,Henry IV,7,5.1.30,PRINCE HENRY,"Peace, chewet, peace!"
2669,Henry IV,8,5.1.31,EARL OF WORCESTER,It pleased your majesty to turn your looks
2670,Henry IV,8,5.1.32,EARL OF WORCESTER,"Of favour from myself and all our house,"
2671,Henry IV,8,5.1.33,EARL OF WORCESTER,"And yet I must remember you, my lord,"
2672,Henry IV,8,5.1.34,EARL OF WORCESTER,We were the first and dearest of your friends.
2673,Henry IV,8,5.1.35,EARL OF WORCESTER,For you my staff of office did I break
2674,Henry IV,8,5.1.36,EARL OF WORCESTER,"In Richard's time, and posted day and night"
2675,Henry IV,8,5.1.37,EARL OF WORCESTER,"to meet you on the way, and kiss your hand,"
2676,Henry IV,8,5.1.38,EARL OF WORCESTER,When yet you were in place and in account
2677,Henry IV,8,5.1.39,EARL OF WORCESTER,Nothing so strong and fortunate as I.
2678,Henry IV,8,5.1.40,EARL OF WORCESTER,"It was myself, my brother and his son,"
2679,Henry IV,8,5.1.41,EARL OF WORCESTER,That brought you home and boldly did outdare
2680,Henry IV,8,5.1.42,EARL OF WORCESTER,"The dangers of the time. You swore to us,"
2681,Henry IV,8,5.1.43,EARL OF WORCESTER,"And you did swear that oath at Doncaster,"
2682,Henry IV,8,5.1.44,EARL OF WORCESTER,"That you did nothing purpose 'gainst the state,"
2683,Henry IV,8,5.1.45,EARL OF WORCESTER,"Nor claim no further than your new-fall'n right,"
2684,Henry IV,8,5.1.46,EARL OF WORCESTER,"The seat of Gaunt, dukedom of Lancaster:"
2685,Henry IV,8,5.1.47,EARL OF WORCESTER,To this we swore our aid. But in short space
2686,Henry IV,8,5.1.48,EARL OF WORCESTER,"It rain'd down fortune showering on your head,"
2687,Henry IV,8,5.1.49,EARL OF WORCESTER,"And such a flood of greatness fell on you,"
2688,Henry IV,8,5.1.50,EARL OF WORCESTER,"What with our help, what with the absent king,"
2689,Henry IV,8,5.1.51,EARL OF WORCESTER,"What with the injuries of a wanton time,"
2690,Henry IV,8,5.1.52,EARL OF WORCESTER,"The seeming sufferances that you had borne,"
2691,Henry IV,8,5.1.53,EARL OF WORCESTER,And the contrarious winds that held the king
2692,Henry IV,8,5.1.54,EARL OF WORCESTER,So long in his unlucky Irish wars
2693,Henry IV,8,5.1.55,EARL OF WORCESTER,That all in England did repute him dead:
2694,Henry IV,8,5.1.56,EARL OF WORCESTER,And from this swarm of fair advantages
2695,Henry IV,8,5.1.57,EARL OF WORCESTER,You took occasion to be quickly woo'd
2696,Henry IV,8,5.1.58,EARL OF WORCESTER,"To gripe the general sway into your hand,"
2697,Henry IV,8,5.1.59,EARL OF WORCESTER,"Forget your oath to us at Doncaster,"
2698,Henry IV,8,5.1.60,EARL OF WORCESTER,And being fed by us you used us so
2699,Henry IV,8,5.1.61,EARL OF WORCESTER,"As that ungentle hull, the cuckoo's bird,"
2700,Henry IV,8,5.1.62,EARL OF WORCESTER,"Useth the sparrow, did oppress our nest,"
2701,Henry IV,8,5.1.63,EARL OF WORCESTER,Grew by our feeding to so great a bulk
2702,Henry IV,8,5.1.64,EARL OF WORCESTER,That even our love durst not come near your sight
2703,Henry IV,8,5.1.65,EARL OF WORCESTER,"For fear of swallowing, but with nimble wing"
2704,Henry IV,8,5.1.66,EARL OF WORCESTER,"We were enforced, for safety sake, to fly"
2705,Henry IV,8,5.1.67,EARL OF WORCESTER,"Out of sight and raise this present head,"
2706,Henry IV,8,5.1.68,EARL OF WORCESTER,Whereby we stand opposed by such means
2707,Henry IV,8,5.1.69,EARL OF WORCESTER,As you yourself have forged against yourself
2708,Henry IV,8,5.1.70,EARL OF WORCESTER,"By unkind usage, dangerous countenance,"
2709,Henry IV,8,5.1.71,EARL OF WORCESTER,And violation of all faith and troth
2710,Henry IV,8,5.1.72,EARL OF WORCESTER,Sworn to us in your younger enterprise.
2711,Henry IV,9,5.1.73,KING HENRY IV,"These things indeed you have articulate,"
2712,Henry IV,9,5.1.74,KING HENRY IV,"Proclaim'd at market-crosses, read in churches,"
2713,Henry IV,9,5.1.75,KING HENRY IV,To face the garment of rebellion
2714,Henry IV,9,5.1.76,KING HENRY IV,With some fine colour that may please the eye
2715,Henry IV,9,5.1.77,KING HENRY IV,"Of fickle changelings and poor discontents,"
2716,Henry IV,9,5.1.78,KING HENRY IV,Which gape and rub the elbow at the news
2717,Henry IV,9,5.1.79,KING HENRY IV,Of hurlyburly innovation:
2718,Henry IV,9,5.1.80,KING HENRY IV,And never yet did insurrection want
2719,Henry IV,9,5.1.81,KING HENRY IV,"Such water-colours to impaint his cause,"
2720,Henry IV,9,5.1.82,KING HENRY IV,"Nor moody beggars, starving for a time"
2721,Henry IV,9,5.1.83,KING HENRY IV,Of pellmell havoc and confusion.
2722,Henry IV,10,5.1.84,PRINCE HENRY,In both your armies there is many a soul
2723,Henry IV,10,5.1.85,PRINCE HENRY,"Shall pay full dearly for this encounter,"
2724,Henry IV,10,5.1.86,PRINCE HENRY,"If once they join in trial. Tell your nephew,"
2725,Henry IV,10,5.1.87,PRINCE HENRY,The Prince of Wales doth join with all the world
2726,Henry IV,10,5.1.88,PRINCE HENRY,"In praise of Henry Percy: by my hopes,"
2727,Henry IV,10,5.1.89,PRINCE HENRY,"This present enterprise set off his head,"
2728,Henry IV,10,5.1.90,PRINCE HENRY,"I do not think a braver gentleman,"
2729,Henry IV,10,5.1.91,PRINCE HENRY,"More active-valiant or more valiant-young,"
2730,Henry IV,10,5.1.92,PRINCE HENRY,"More daring or more bold, is now alive"
2731,Henry IV,10,5.1.93,PRINCE HENRY,To grace this latter age with noble deeds.
2732,Henry IV,10,5.1.94,PRINCE HENRY,"For my part, I may speak it to my shame,"
2733,Henry IV,10,5.1.95,PRINCE HENRY,"I have a truant been to chivalry,"
2734,Henry IV,10,5.1.96,PRINCE HENRY,"And so I hear he doth account me too,"
2735,Henry IV,10,5.1.97,PRINCE HENRY,Yet this before my father's majesty--
2736,Henry IV,10,5.1.98,PRINCE HENRY,I am content that he shall take the odds
2737,Henry IV,10,5.1.99,PRINCE HENRY,"Of his great name and estimation,"
2738,Henry IV,10,5.1.100,PRINCE HENRY,"And will, to save the blood on either side,"
2739,Henry IV,10,5.1.101,PRINCE HENRY,Try fortune with him in a single fight.
2740,Henry IV,11,5.1.102,KING HENRY IV,"And, Prince of Wales, so dare we venture thee,"
2741,Henry IV,11,5.1.103,KING HENRY IV,Albeit considerations infinite
2742,Henry IV,11,5.1.104,KING HENRY IV,"Do make against it. No, good Worcester, no,"
2743,Henry IV,11,5.1.105,KING HENRY IV,"We love our people well, even those we love"
2744,Henry IV,11,5.1.106,KING HENRY IV,"That are misled upon your cousin's part,"
2745,Henry IV,11,5.1.107,KING HENRY IV,"And, will they take the offer of our grace,"
2746,Henry IV,11,5.1.108,KING HENRY IV,"Both he and they and you, every man"
2747,Henry IV,11,5.1.109,KING HENRY IV,Shall be my friend again and I'll be his:
2748,Henry IV,11,5.1.110,KING HENRY IV,"So tell your cousin, and bring me word"
2749,Henry IV,11,5.1.111,KING HENRY IV,"What he will do: but if he will not yield,"
2750,Henry IV,11,5.1.112,KING HENRY IV,Rebuke and dread correction wait on us
2751,Henry IV,11,5.1.113,KING HENRY IV,"And they shall do their office. So, be gone,"
2752,Henry IV,11,5.1.114,KING HENRY IV,We will not now be troubled with reply:
2753,Henry IV,11,5.1.115,KING HENRY IV,"We offer fair, take it advisedly."
2754,Henry IV,11,,KING HENRY IV,Exeunt WORCESTER and VERNON
2755,Henry IV,12,5.1.116,PRINCE HENRY,"It will not be accepted, on my life:"
2756,Henry IV,12,5.1.117,PRINCE HENRY,The Douglas and the Hotspur both together
2757,Henry IV,12,5.1.118,PRINCE HENRY,Are confident against the world in arms.
2758,Henry IV,13,5.1.119,KING HENRY IV,"Hence, therefore, every leader to his charge,"
2759,Henry IV,13,5.1.120,KING HENRY IV,"For, on their answer, will we set on them:"
2760,Henry IV,13,5.1.121,KING HENRY IV,"And God befriend us, as our cause is just!"
2761,Henry IV,13,,KING HENRY IV,Exeunt all but PRINCE HENRY and FALSTAFF
2762,Henry IV,14,5.1.122,FALSTAFF,"Hal, if thou see me down in the battle and bestride"
2763,Henry IV,14,5.1.123,FALSTAFF,"me, so, 'tis a point of friendship."
2764,Henry IV,15,5.1.124,PRINCE HENRY,Nothing but a colossus can do thee that friendship.
2765,Henry IV,15,5.1.125,PRINCE HENRY,"Say thy prayers, and farewell."
2766,Henry IV,16,5.1.126,FALSTAFF,"I  would 'twere bed-time, Hal, and all well."
2767,Henry IV,17,5.1.127,PRINCE HENRY,"Why, thou owest God a death."
2768,Henry IV,17,,PRINCE HENRY,Exit PRINCE HENRY
2769,Henry IV,18,5.1.128,FALSTAFF,"'Tis not due yet, I would be loath to pay him before"
2770,Henry IV,18,5.1.129,FALSTAFF,his day. What need I be so forward with him that
2771,Henry IV,18,5.1.130,FALSTAFF,"calls not on me? Well, 'tis no matter, honour pricks"
2772,Henry IV,18,5.1.131,FALSTAFF,"me on. Yea, but how if honour prick me off when I"
2773,Henry IV,18,5.1.132,FALSTAFF,come on? how then? Can honour set to a leg? no: or
2774,Henry IV,18,5.1.133,FALSTAFF,an arm? no: or take away the grief of a wound? no.
2775,Henry IV,18,5.1.134,FALSTAFF,"Honour hath no skill in surgery, then? no. What is"
2776,Henry IV,18,5.1.135,FALSTAFF,honour? a word. What is in that word honour? what
2777,Henry IV,18,5.1.136,FALSTAFF,is that honour? air. A trim reckoning! Who hath it?
2778,Henry IV,18,5.1.137,FALSTAFF,he that died o' Wednesday. Doth he feel it? no.
2779,Henry IV,18,5.1.138,FALSTAFF,"Doth he hear it? no. 'Tis insensible, then. Yea,"
2780,Henry IV,18,5.1.139,FALSTAFF,to the dead. But will it not live with the living?
2781,Henry IV,18,5.1.140,FALSTAFF,no. Why? detraction will not suffer it. Therefore
2782,Henry IV,18,5.1.141,FALSTAFF,I'll none of it. Honour is a mere scutcheon: and so
2783,Henry IV,18,5.1.142,FALSTAFF,ends my catechism.
2784,Henry IV,18,,FALSTAFF,Exit
2785,Henry IV,18,,FALSTAFF,SCENE II. The rebel camp.
2786,Henry IV,18,,FALSTAFF,Enter WORCESTER and VERNON

2788,Henry IV,1,5.2.2,EARL OF WORCESTER,The liberal and kind offer of the king.
2789,Henry IV,2,5.2.3,VERNON,'Twere best he did.
2790,Henry IV,3,5.2.4,EARL OF WORCESTER,Then are we all undone.
2791,Henry IV,3,5.2.5,EARL OF WORCESTER,"It is not possible, it cannot be,"
2792,Henry IV,3,5.2.6,EARL OF WORCESTER,"The king should keep his word in loving us,"
2793,Henry IV,3,5.2.7,EARL OF WORCESTER,He will suspect us still and find a time
2794,Henry IV,3,5.2.8,EARL OF WORCESTER,To punish this offence in other faults:
2795,Henry IV,3,5.2.9,EARL OF WORCESTER,"Suspicion all our lives shall be stuck full of eyes,"
2796,Henry IV,3,5.2.10,EARL OF WORCESTER,"For treason is but trusted like the fox,"
2797,Henry IV,3,5.2.11,EARL OF WORCESTER,"Who, ne'er so tame, so cherish'd and lock'd up,"
2798,Henry IV,3,5.2.12,EARL OF WORCESTER,Will have a wild trick of his ancestors.
2799,Henry IV,3,5.2.13,EARL OF WORCESTER,"Look how we can, or sad or merrily,"
2800,Henry IV,3,5.2.14,EARL OF WORCESTER,"Interpretation will misquote our looks,"
2801,Henry IV,3,5.2.15,EARL OF WORCESTER,"And we shall feed like oxen at a stall,"
2802,Henry IV,3,5.2.16,EARL OF WORCESTER,"The better cherish'd, still the nearer death."
2803,Henry IV,3,5.2.17,EARL OF WORCESTER,"My nephew's trespass may be well forgot,"
2804,Henry IV,3,5.2.18,EARL OF WORCESTER,"it hath the excuse of youth and heat of blood,"
2805,Henry IV,3,5.2.19,EARL OF WORCESTER,"And an adopted name of privilege,"
2806,Henry IV,3,5.2.20,EARL OF WORCESTER,"A hair-brain'd Hotspur, govern'd by a spleen:"
2807,Henry IV,3,5.2.21,EARL OF WORCESTER,All his offences live upon my head
2808,Henry IV,3,5.2.22,EARL OF WORCESTER,"And on his father's, we did train him on,"
2809,Henry IV,3,5.2.23,EARL OF WORCESTER,"And, his corruption being ta'en from us,"
2810,Henry IV,3,5.2.24,EARL OF WORCESTER,"We, as the spring of all, shall pay for all."
2811,Henry IV,3,5.2.25,EARL OF WORCESTER,"Therefore, good cousin, let not Harry know,"
2812,Henry IV,3,5.2.26,EARL OF WORCESTER,"In any case, the offer of the king."
2813,Henry IV,4,5.2.27,VERNON,"Deliver what you will, I'll say 'tis so."
2814,Henry IV,4,5.2.28,VERNON,Here comes your cousin.
2815,Henry IV,4,,VERNON,Enter HOTSPUR and DOUGLAS
2816,Henry IV,5,5.2.29,HOTSPUR,My uncle is return'd:
2817,Henry IV,5,5.2.30,HOTSPUR,Deliver up my Lord of Westmoreland.
2818,Henry IV,5,5.2.31,HOTSPUR,"Uncle, what news?"
2819,Henry IV,6,5.2.32,EARL OF WORCESTER,The king will bid you battle presently.
2820,Henry IV,7,5.2.33,EARL OF DOUGLAS,Defy him by the Lord of Westmoreland.
2821,Henry IV,8,5.2.34,HOTSPUR,"Lord Douglas, go you and tell him so."
2822,Henry IV,9,5.2.35,EARL OF DOUGLAS,"Marry, and shall, and very willingly."
2823,Henry IV,9,,EARL OF DOUGLAS,Exit
2824,Henry IV,10,5.2.36,EARL OF WORCESTER,There is no seeming mercy in the king.
2825,Henry IV,11,5.2.37,HOTSPUR,Did you beg any? God forbid!
2826,Henry IV,12,5.2.38,EARL OF WORCESTER,"I told him gently of our grievances,"
2827,Henry IV,12,5.2.39,EARL OF WORCESTER,"Of his oath-breaking, which he mended thus,"
2828,Henry IV,12,5.2.40,EARL OF WORCESTER,By now forswearing that he is forsworn:
2829,Henry IV,12,5.2.41,EARL OF WORCESTER,"He calls us rebels, traitors, and will scourge"
2830,Henry IV,12,5.2.42,EARL OF WORCESTER,With haughty arms this hateful name in us.
2831,Henry IV,12,,EARL OF WORCESTER,Re-enter the EARL OF DOUGLAS
2832,Henry IV,13,5.2.43,EARL OF DOUGLAS,"Arm, gentlemen, to arms! for I have thrown"
2833,Henry IV,13,5.2.44,EARL OF DOUGLAS,"A brave defiance in King Henry's teeth,"
2834,Henry IV,13,5.2.45,EARL OF DOUGLAS,"And Westmoreland, that was engaged, did bear it,"
2835,Henry IV,13,5.2.46,EARL OF DOUGLAS,Which cannot choose but bring him quickly on.
2836,Henry IV,14,5.2.47,EARL OF WORCESTER,"The Prince of Wales stepp'd forth before the king,"
2837,Henry IV,14,5.2.48,EARL OF WORCESTER,"And, nephew, challenged you to single fight."
2838,Henry IV,15,5.2.49,HOTSPUR,"O, would the quarrel lay upon our heads,"
2839,Henry IV,15,5.2.50,HOTSPUR,And that no man might draw short breath today
2840,Henry IV,15,5.2.51,HOTSPUR,"But I and Harry Monmouth! Tell me, tell me,"
2841,Henry IV,15,5.2.52,HOTSPUR,How show'd his tasking? seem'd it in contempt?
2842,Henry IV,16,5.2.53,VERNON,"No, by my soul, I never in my life"
2843,Henry IV,16,5.2.54,VERNON,"Did hear a challenge urged more modestly,"
2844,Henry IV,16,5.2.55,VERNON,Unless a brother should a brother dare
2845,Henry IV,16,5.2.56,VERNON,To gentle exercise and proof of arms.
2846,Henry IV,16,5.2.57,VERNON,"He gave you all the duties of a man,"
2847,Henry IV,16,5.2.58,VERNON,"Trimm'd up your praises with a princely tongue,"
2848,Henry IV,16,5.2.59,VERNON,"Spoke to your deservings like a chronicle,"
2849,Henry IV,16,5.2.60,VERNON,Making you ever better than his praise
2850,Henry IV,16,5.2.61,VERNON,"By still dispraising praise valued in you,"
2851,Henry IV,16,5.2.62,VERNON,"And, which became him like a prince indeed,"
2852,Henry IV,16,5.2.63,VERNON,"He made a blushing cital of himself,"
2853,Henry IV,16,5.2.64,VERNON,And chid his truant youth with such a grace
2854,Henry IV,16,5.2.65,VERNON,As if he master'd there a double spirit.
2855,Henry IV,16,5.2.66,VERNON,Of teaching and of learning instantly.
2856,Henry IV,16,5.2.67,VERNON,"There did he pause: but let me tell the world,"
2857,Henry IV,16,5.2.68,VERNON,"If he outlive the envy of this day,"
2858,Henry IV,16,5.2.69,VERNON,"England did never owe so sweet a hope,"
2859,Henry IV,16,5.2.70,VERNON,So much misconstrued in his wantonness.
2860,Henry IV,17,5.2.71,HOTSPUR,"Cousin, I think thou art enamoured"
2861,Henry IV,17,5.2.72,HOTSPUR,On his follies: never did I hear
2862,Henry IV,17,5.2.73,HOTSPUR,Of any prince so wild a libertine.
2863,Henry IV,17,5.2.74,HOTSPUR,"But be he as he will, yet once ere night"
2864,Henry IV,17,5.2.75,HOTSPUR,"I will embrace him with a soldier's arm,"
2865,Henry IV,17,5.2.76,HOTSPUR,That he shall shrink under my courtesy.
2866,Henry IV,17,5.2.77,HOTSPUR,"Arm, arm with speed: and, fellows, soldiers, friends,"
2867,Henry IV,17,5.2.78,HOTSPUR,Better consider what you have to do
2868,Henry IV,17,5.2.79,HOTSPUR,"Than I, that have not well the gift of tongue,"
2869,Henry IV,17,5.2.80,HOTSPUR,Can lift your blood up with persuasion.
2870,Henry IV,17,,HOTSPUR,Enter a Messenger
2871,Henry IV,18,5.2.81,Messenger,"My lord, here are letters for you."
2872,Henry IV,19,5.2.82,HOTSPUR,I cannot read them now.
2873,Henry IV,19,5.2.83,HOTSPUR,"O gentlemen, the time of life is short!"
2874,Henry IV,19,5.2.84,HOTSPUR,"To spend that shortness basely were too long,"
2875,Henry IV,19,5.2.85,HOTSPUR,"If life did ride upon a dial's point,"
2876,Henry IV,19,5.2.86,HOTSPUR,Still ending at the arrival of an hour.
2877,Henry IV,19,5.2.87,HOTSPUR,"An if we live, we live to tread on kings,"
2878,Henry IV,19,5.2.88,HOTSPUR,"If die, brave death, when princes die with us!"
2879,Henry IV,19,5.2.89,HOTSPUR,"Now, for our consciences, the arms are fair,"
2880,Henry IV,19,5.2.90,HOTSPUR,When the intent of bearing them is just.
2881,Henry IV,19,,HOTSPUR,Enter another Messenger
2882,Henry IV,20,5.2.91,Messenger,"My lord, prepare, the king comes on apace."
2883,Henry IV,21,5.2.92,HOTSPUR,"I thank him, that he cuts me from my tale,"
2884,Henry IV,21,5.2.93,HOTSPUR,"For I profess not talking, only this--"
2885,Henry IV,21,5.2.94,HOTSPUR,Let each man do his best: and here draw I
2886,Henry IV,21,5.2.95,HOTSPUR,"A sword, whose temper I intend to stain"
2887,Henry IV,21,5.2.96,HOTSPUR,With the best blood that I can meet withal
2888,Henry IV,21,5.2.97,HOTSPUR,In the adventure of this perilous day.
2889,Henry IV,21,5.2.98,HOTSPUR,"Now, Esperance! Percy! and set on."
2890,Henry IV,21,5.2.99,HOTSPUR,"Sound all the lofty instruments of war,"
2891,Henry IV,21,5.2.100,HOTSPUR,"And by that music let us all embrace,"
2892,Henry IV,21,5.2.101,HOTSPUR,"For, heaven to earth, some of us never shall"
2893,Henry IV,21,5.2.102,HOTSPUR,A second time do such a courtesy.
2894,Henry IV,21,,HOTSPUR,"The trumpets sound. They embrace, and exeunt"
2895,Henry IV,21,,HOTSPUR,SCENE III. Plain between the camps.
2896,Henry IV,21,,HOTSPUR,KING HENRY enters with his power. Alarum to the battle. Then enter DOUGLAS and SIR WALTER BLUNT
2897,Henry IV,1,5.3.1,SIR WALTER BLUNT,"What is thy name, that in the battle thus"
2898,Henry IV,1,5.3.2,SIR WALTER BLUNT,Thou crossest me? what honour dost thou seek
2899,Henry IV,1,5.3.3,SIR WALTER BLUNT,Upon my head?
2900,Henry IV,2,5.3.4,EARL OF DOUGLAS,"Know then, my name is Douglas,"
2901,Henry IV,2,5.3.5,EARL OF DOUGLAS,And I do haunt thee in the battle thus
2902,Henry IV,2,5.3.6,EARL OF DOUGLAS,Because some tell me that thou art a king.
2903,Henry IV,3,5.3.7,SIR WALTER BLUNT,They tell thee true.
2904,Henry IV,4,5.3.8,EARL OF DOUGLAS,The Lord of Stafford dear to-day hath bought
2905,Henry IV,4,5.3.9,EARL OF DOUGLAS,"Thy likeness, for instead of thee, King Harry,"
2906,Henry IV,4,5.3.10,EARL OF DOUGLAS,"This sword hath ended him: so shall it thee,"
2907,Henry IV,4,5.3.11,EARL OF DOUGLAS,Unless thou yield thee as my prisoner.
2908,Henry IV,5,5.3.12,SIR WALTER BLUNT,"I was not born a yielder, thou proud Scot,"
2909,Henry IV,5,5.3.13,SIR WALTER BLUNT,And thou shalt find a king that will revenge
2910,Henry IV,5,5.3.14,SIR WALTER BLUNT,Lord Stafford's death.
2911,Henry IV,5,,SIR WALTER BLUNT,They fight. DOUGLAS kills SIR WALTER BLUNT. Enter HOTSPUR
2912,Henry IV,6,5.3.15,HOTSPUR,"O Douglas, hadst thou fought at Holmedon thus,"
2913,Henry IV,6,5.3.16,HOTSPUR,never had triumph'd upon a Scot.
2914,Henry IV,7,5.3.17,EARL OF DOUGLAS,"All's done, all's won, here breathless lies the king."
2915,Henry IV,8,5.3.18,HOTSPUR,Where?
2916,Henry IV,9,5.3.19,EARL OF DOUGLAS,Here.
2917,Henry IV,10,5.3.20,HOTSPUR,"This, Douglas? no: I know this face full well:"
2918,Henry IV,10,5.3.21,HOTSPUR,"A gallant knight he was, his name was Blunt,"
2919,Henry IV,10,5.3.22,HOTSPUR,Semblably furnish'd like the king himself.
2920,Henry IV,11,5.3.23,EARL OF DOUGLAS,"A fool go with thy soul, whither it goes!"
2921,Henry IV,11,5.3.24,EARL OF DOUGLAS,A borrow'd title hast thou bought too dear:
2922,Henry IV,11,5.3.25,EARL OF DOUGLAS,Why didst thou tell me that thou wert a king?
2923,Henry IV,12,5.3.26,HOTSPUR,The king hath many marching in his coats.
2924,Henry IV,13,5.3.27,EARL OF DOUGLAS,"Now, by my sword, I will kill all his coats,"
2925,Henry IV,13,5.3.28,EARL OF DOUGLAS,"I'll murder all his wardrobe, piece by piece,"
2926,Henry IV,13,5.3.29,EARL OF DOUGLAS,Until I meet the king.
2927,Henry IV,14,5.3.30,HOTSPUR,"Up, and away!"
2928,Henry IV,14,5.3.31,HOTSPUR,Our soldiers stand full fairly for the day.
2929,Henry IV,14,,HOTSPUR,Exeunt
2930,Henry IV,14,,HOTSPUR,"Alarum. Enter FALSTAFF, solus"
2931,Henry IV,15,5.3.32,FALSTAFF,"Though I could 'scape shot-free at London, I fear"
2932,Henry IV,15,5.3.33,FALSTAFF,"the shot here, here's no scoring but upon the pate."
2933,Henry IV,15,5.3.34,FALSTAFF,Soft! who are you? Sir Walter Blunt: there's honour
2934,Henry IV,15,5.3.35,FALSTAFF,for you! here's no vanity! I am as hot as moulten
2935,Henry IV,15,5.3.36,FALSTAFF,"lead, and as heavy too: God keep lead out of me! I"
2936,Henry IV,15,5.3.37,FALSTAFF,need no more weight than mine own bowels. I have
2937,Henry IV,15,5.3.38,FALSTAFF,led my ragamuffins where they are peppered: there's
2938,Henry IV,15,5.3.39,FALSTAFF,"not three of my hundred and fifty left alive, and"
2939,Henry IV,15,5.3.40,FALSTAFF,"they are for the town's end, to beg during life."
2940,Henry IV,15,5.3.41,FALSTAFF,But who comes here?
2941,Henry IV,15,,FALSTAFF,Enter PRINCE HENRY
2942,Henry IV,16,5.3.42,PRINCE HENRY,"What, stand'st thou idle here? lend me thy sword:"
2943,Henry IV,16,5.3.43,PRINCE HENRY,Many a nobleman lies stark and stiff
2944,Henry IV,16,5.3.44,PRINCE HENRY,"Under the hoofs of vaunting enemies,"
2945,Henry IV,16,5.3.45,PRINCE HENRY,"Whose deaths are yet unrevenged: I prithee,"
2946,Henry IV,16,5.3.46,PRINCE HENRY,lend me thy sword.
2947,Henry IV,17,5.3.47,FALSTAFF,"O Hal, I prithee, give me leave to breathe awhile."
2948,Henry IV,17,5.3.48,FALSTAFF,Turk Gregory never did such deeds in arms as I have
2949,Henry IV,17,5.3.49,FALSTAFF,"done this day. I have paid Percy, I have made him sure."
2950,Henry IV,18,5.3.50,PRINCE HENRY,"He is, indeed, and living to kill thee. I prithee,"
2951,Henry IV,18,5.3.51,PRINCE HENRY,lend me thy sword.
2952,Henry IV,19,5.3.52,FALSTAFF,"Nay, before God, Hal, if Percy be alive, thou get'st"
2953,Henry IV,19,5.3.53,FALSTAFF,"not my sword, but take my pistol, if thou wilt."
2954,Henry IV,20,5.3.54,PRINCE HENRY,"Give it to me: what, is it in the case?"
2955,Henry IV,21,5.3.55,FALSTAFF,"Ay, Hal, 'tis hot, 'tis hot, there's that will sack a city."
2956,Henry IV,21,,FALSTAFF,"PRINCE HENRY draws it out, and finds it to be a bottle of sack"
2957,Henry IV,22,5.3.56,PRINCE HENRY,"What, is it a time to jest and dally now?"
2958,Henry IV,22,,PRINCE HENRY,He throws the bottle at him. Exit
2959,Henry IV,23,5.3.57,FALSTAFF,"Well, if Percy be alive, I'll pierce him. If he do"
2960,Henry IV,23,5.3.58,FALSTAFF,"come in my way, so: if he do not, if I come in his"
2961,Henry IV,23,5.3.59,FALSTAFF,"willingly, let him make a carbonado of me. I like"
2962,Henry IV,23,5.3.60,FALSTAFF,not such grinning honour as Sir Walter hath: give me
2963,Henry IV,23,5.3.61,FALSTAFF,"life: which if I can save, so, if not, honour comes"
2964,Henry IV,23,5.3.62,FALSTAFF,"unlooked for, and there's an end."
2965,Henry IV,23,,FALSTAFF,Exit FALSTAFF
2966,Henry IV,23,,FALSTAFF,SCENE IV. Another part of the field.
2967,Henry IV,23,,FALSTAFF,"Alarum. Excursions. Enter PRINCE HENRY, LORD JOHN OF LANCASTER, and EARL OF WESTMORELAND"
2968,Henry IV,1,5.4.1,KING HENRY IV,"I prithee,"
2969,Henry IV,1,5.4.2,KING HENRY IV,"Harry, withdraw thyself, thou bleed'st too much."
2970,Henry IV,1,5.4.3,KING HENRY IV,"Lord John of Lancaster, go you with him."
2971,Henry IV,2,5.4.4,LANCASTER,"Not I, my lord, unless I did bleed too."
2972,Henry IV,3,5.4.5,PRINCE HENRY,"I beseech your majesty, make up,"
2973,Henry IV,3,5.4.6,PRINCE HENRY,Lest your retirement do amaze your friends.
2974,Henry IV,4,5.4.7,KING HENRY IV,I will do so.
2975,Henry IV,4,5.4.8,KING HENRY IV,"My Lord of Westmoreland, lead him to his tent."
2976,Henry IV,5,5.4.9,WESTMORELAND,"Come, my lord, I'll lead you to your tent."
2977,Henry IV,6,5.4.10,PRINCE HENRY,"Lead me, my lord? I do not need your help:"
2978,Henry IV,6,5.4.11,PRINCE HENRY,And God forbid a shallow scratch should drive
2979,Henry IV,6,5.4.12,PRINCE HENRY,"The Prince of Wales from such a field as this,"
2980,Henry IV,6,5.4.13,PRINCE HENRY,"Where stain'd nobility lies trodden on,"
2981,Henry IV,6,5.4.14,PRINCE HENRY,and rebels' arms triumph in massacres!
2982,Henry IV,7,5.4.15,LANCASTER,"We breathe too long: come, cousin Westmoreland,"
2983,Henry IV,7,5.4.16,LANCASTER,"Our duty this way lies, for God's sake come."
2984,Henry IV,7,,LANCASTER,Exeunt LANCASTER and WESTMORELAND
2985,Henry IV,8,5.4.17,PRINCE HENRY,"By God, thou hast deceived me, Lancaster,"
2986,Henry IV,8,5.4.18,PRINCE HENRY,I did not think thee lord of such a spirit:
2987,Henry IV,8,5.4.19,PRINCE HENRY,"Before, I loved thee as a brother, John,"
2988,Henry IV,8,5.4.20,PRINCE HENRY,"But now, I do respect thee as my soul."
2989,Henry IV,9,5.4.21,KING HENRY IV,I saw him hold Lord Percy at the point
2990,Henry IV,9,5.4.22,KING HENRY IV,With lustier maintenance than I did look for
2991,Henry IV,9,5.4.23,KING HENRY IV,Of such an ungrown warrior.
2992,Henry IV,10,5.4.24,PRINCE HENRY,"O, this boy"
2993,Henry IV,10,5.4.25,PRINCE HENRY,Lends mettle to us all!

2995,Henry IV,10,,PRINCE HENRY,Enter DOUGLAS
2996,Henry IV,11,5.4.26,EARL OF DOUGLAS,Another king! they grow like Hydra's heads:
2997,Henry IV,11,5.4.27,EARL OF DOUGLAS,"I am the Douglas, fatal to all those"
2998,Henry IV,11,5.4.28,EARL OF DOUGLAS,"That wear those colours on them: what art thou,"
2999,Henry IV,11,5.4.29,EARL OF DOUGLAS,That counterfeit'st the person of a king?
3000,Henry IV,12,5.4.30,KING HENRY IV,"The king himself, who, Douglas, grieves at heart"
3001,Henry IV,12,5.4.31,KING HENRY IV,So many of his shadows thou hast met
3002,Henry IV,12,5.4.32,KING HENRY IV,And not the very king. I have two boys
3003,Henry IV,12,5.4.33,KING HENRY IV,Seek Percy and thyself about the field:
3004,Henry IV,12,5.4.34,KING HENRY IV,"But, seeing thou fall'st on me so luckily,"
3005,Henry IV,12,5.4.35,KING HENRY IV,"I will assay thee: so, defend thyself."
3006,Henry IV,13,5.4.36,EARL OF DOUGLAS,"I fear thou art another counterfeit,"
3007,Henry IV,13,5.4.37,EARL OF DOUGLAS,"And yet, in faith, thou bear'st thee like a king:"
3008,Henry IV,13,5.4.38,EARL OF DOUGLAS,"But mine I am sure thou art, whoe'er thou be,"
3009,Henry IV,13,5.4.39,EARL OF DOUGLAS,And thus I win thee.
3010,Henry IV,13,,EARL OF DOUGLAS,"They fight. KING HENRY being in danger, PRINCE HENRY enters"
3011,Henry IV,14,5.4.40,PRINCE HENRY,"Hold up thy head, vile Scot, or thou art like"
3012,Henry IV,14,5.4.41,PRINCE HENRY,Never to hold it up again! the spirits
3013,Henry IV,14,5.4.42,PRINCE HENRY,"Of valiant Shirley, Stafford, Blunt, are in my arms:"
3014,Henry IV,14,5.4.43,PRINCE HENRY,"It is the Prince of Wales that threatens thee,"
3015,Henry IV,14,5.4.44,PRINCE HENRY,Who never promiseth but he means to pay.
3016,Henry IV,14,5.4.44,PRINCE HENRY,They fight: DOUGLAS flies
3017,Henry IV,14,5.4.45,PRINCE HENRY,"Cheerly, my lord	how fares your grace?"
3018,Henry IV,14,5.4.46,PRINCE HENRY,"Sir Nicholas Gawsey hath for succor sent,"
3019,Henry IV,14,5.4.47,PRINCE HENRY,And so hath Clifton: I'll to Clifton straight.
3020,Henry IV,15,5.4.48,KING HENRY IV,"Stay, and breathe awhile:"
3021,Henry IV,15,5.4.49,KING HENRY IV,"Thou hast redeem'd thy lost opinion,"
3022,Henry IV,15,5.4.50,KING HENRY IV,"And show'd thou makest some tender of my life,"
3023,Henry IV,15,5.4.51,KING HENRY IV,In this fair rescue thou hast brought to me.
3024,Henry IV,16,5.4.52,PRINCE HENRY,O God! they did me too much injury
3025,Henry IV,16,5.4.53,PRINCE HENRY,That ever said I hearken'd for your death.
3026,Henry IV,16,5.4.54,PRINCE HENRY,"If it were so, I might have let alone"
3027,Henry IV,16,5.4.55,PRINCE HENRY,"The insulting hand of Douglas over you,"
3028,Henry IV,16,5.4.56,PRINCE HENRY,Which would have been as speedy in your end
3029,Henry IV,16,5.4.57,PRINCE HENRY,As all the poisonous potions in the world
3030,Henry IV,16,5.4.58,PRINCE HENRY,And saved the treacherous labour of your son.
3031,Henry IV,17,5.4.59,KING HENRY IV,Make up to Clifton: I'll to Sir Nicholas Gawsey.
3032,Henry IV,17,,KING HENRY IV,Exit
3033,Henry IV,17,,KING HENRY IV,Enter HOTSPUR
3034,Henry IV,18,5.4.60,HOTSPUR,"If I mistake not, thou art Harry Monmouth."
3035,Henry IV,19,5.4.61,PRINCE HENRY,Thou speak'st as if I would deny my name.
3036,Henry IV,20,5.4.62,HOTSPUR,My name is Harry Percy.
3037,Henry IV,21,5.4.63,PRINCE HENRY,"Why, then I see"
3038,Henry IV,21,5.4.64,PRINCE HENRY,A very valiant rebel of the name.
3039,Henry IV,21,5.4.65,PRINCE HENRY,"I am the Prince of Wales, and think not, Percy,"
3040,Henry IV,21,5.4.66,PRINCE HENRY,To share with me in glory any more:
3041,Henry IV,21,5.4.67,PRINCE HENRY,"Two stars keep not their motion in one sphere,"
3042,Henry IV,21,5.4.68,PRINCE HENRY,"Nor can one England brook a double reign,"
3043,Henry IV,21,5.4.69,PRINCE HENRY,Of Harry Percy and the Prince of Wales.
3044,Henry IV,22,5.4.70,HOTSPUR,"Nor shall it, Harry, for the hour is come"
3045,Henry IV,22,5.4.71,HOTSPUR,"To end the one of us, and would to God"
3046,Henry IV,22,5.4.72,HOTSPUR,Thy name in arms were now as great as mine!
3047,Henry IV,23,5.4.73,PRINCE HENRY,"I'll make it greater ere I part from thee,"
3048,Henry IV,23,5.4.74,PRINCE HENRY,And all the budding honours on thy crest
3049,Henry IV,23,5.4.75,PRINCE HENRY,"I'll crop, to make a garland for my head."
3050,Henry IV,24,5.4.76,HOTSPUR,I can no longer brook thy vanities.
3051,Henry IV,24,,HOTSPUR,They fight
3052,Henry IV,24,,HOTSPUR,Enter FALSTAFF
3053,Henry IV,25,5.4.77,FALSTAFF,"Well said, Hal! to it Hal! Nay, you shall find no"
3054,Henry IV,25,5.4.78,FALSTAFF,"boy's play here, I can tell you."
3055,Henry IV,25,5.4.78,FALSTAFF,"Re-enter DOUGLAS, he fights with FALSTAFF,  who falls down as if he were dead, and exit DOUGLAS. HOTSPUR is wounded, and falls"
3056,Henry IV,26,5.4.79,HOTSPUR,"O, Harry, thou hast robb'd me of my youth!"
3057,Henry IV,26,5.4.80,HOTSPUR,I better brook the loss of brittle life
3058,Henry IV,26,5.4.81,HOTSPUR,"Than those proud titles thou hast won of me,"
3059,Henry IV,26,5.4.82,HOTSPUR,They wound my thoughts worse than sword my flesh:
3060,Henry IV,26,5.4.83,HOTSPUR,"But thought's the slave of life, and life time's fool,"
3061,Henry IV,26,5.4.84,HOTSPUR,"And time, that takes survey of all the world,"
3062,Henry IV,26,5.4.85,HOTSPUR,"Must have a stop. O, I could prophesy,"
3063,Henry IV,26,5.4.86,HOTSPUR,But that the earthy and cold hand of death
3064,Henry IV,26,5.4.87,HOTSPUR,"Lies on my tongue: no, Percy, thou art dust"
3065,Henry IV,26,5.4.88,HOTSPUR,And food for--
3066,Henry IV,26,,HOTSPUR,Dies
3067,Henry IV,27,5.4.89,PRINCE HENRY,"For worms, brave Percy: fare thee well, great heart!"
3068,Henry IV,27,5.4.90,PRINCE HENRY,"Ill-weaved ambition, how much art thou shrunk!"
3069,Henry IV,27,5.4.91,PRINCE HENRY,"When that this body did contain a spirit,"
3070,Henry IV,27,5.4.92,PRINCE HENRY,"A kingdom for it was too small a bound,"
3071,Henry IV,27,5.4.93,PRINCE HENRY,But now two paces of the vilest earth
3072,Henry IV,27,5.4.94,PRINCE HENRY,Is room enough: this earth that bears thee dead
3073,Henry IV,27,5.4.95,PRINCE HENRY,Bears not alive so stout a gentleman.
3074,Henry IV,27,5.4.96,PRINCE HENRY,"If thou wert sensible of courtesy,"
3075,Henry IV,27,5.4.97,PRINCE HENRY,I should not make so dear a show of zeal:
3076,Henry IV,27,5.4.98,PRINCE HENRY,"But let my favours hide thy mangled face,"
3077,Henry IV,27,5.4.99,PRINCE HENRY,"And, even in thy behalf, I'll thank myself"
3078,Henry IV,27,5.4.100,PRINCE HENRY,For doing these fair rites of tenderness.
3079,Henry IV,27,5.4.101,PRINCE HENRY,"Adieu, and take thy praise with thee to heaven!"
3080,Henry IV,27,5.4.102,PRINCE HENRY,"Thy ignominy sleep with thee in the grave,"
3081,Henry IV,27,5.4.103,PRINCE HENRY,But not remember'd in thy epitaph!
3082,Henry IV,27,,PRINCE HENRY,He spieth FALSTAFF on the ground
3083,Henry IV,27,5.4.104,PRINCE HENRY,"What, old acquaintance! could not all this flesh"
3084,Henry IV,27,5.4.105,PRINCE HENRY,"Keep in a little life? Poor Jack, farewell!"
3085,Henry IV,27,5.4.106,PRINCE HENRY,I could have better spared a better man:
3086,Henry IV,27,5.4.107,PRINCE HENRY,"O, I should have a heavy miss of thee,"
3087,Henry IV,27,5.4.108,PRINCE HENRY,If I were much in love with vanity!
3088,Henry IV,27,5.4.109,PRINCE HENRY,"Death hath not struck so fat a deer to-day,"
3089,Henry IV,27,5.4.110,PRINCE HENRY,"Though many dearer, in this bloody fray."
3090,Henry IV,27,5.4.111,PRINCE HENRY,Embowell'd will I see thee by and by:
3091,Henry IV,27,5.4.112,PRINCE HENRY,Till then in blood by noble Percy lie.
3092,Henry IV,27,,PRINCE HENRY,Exit PRINCE HENRY
3093,Henry IV,28,5.4.113,FALSTAFF,"[Rising up]  Embowelled! if thou embowel me to-day,"
3094,Henry IV,28,5.4.114,FALSTAFF,I'll give you leave to powder me and eat me too
3095,Henry IV,28,5.4.115,FALSTAFF,"to-morrow. 'Sblood,'twas time to counterfeit, or"
3096,Henry IV,28,5.4.116,FALSTAFF,that hot termagant Scot had paid me scot and lot too.
3097,Henry IV,28,5.4.117,FALSTAFF,"Counterfeit? I lie, I am no counterfeit: to die,"
3098,Henry IV,28,5.4.118,FALSTAFF,"is to be a counterfeit, for he is but the"
3099,Henry IV,28,5.4.119,FALSTAFF,counterfeit of a man who hath not the life of a man:
3100,Henry IV,28,5.4.120,FALSTAFF,"but to counterfeit dying, when a man thereby"
3101,Henry IV,28,5.4.121,FALSTAFF,"liveth, is to be no counterfeit, but the true and"
3102,Henry IV,28,5.4.122,FALSTAFF,perfect image of life indeed. The better part of
3103,Henry IV,28,5.4.123,FALSTAFF,"valour is discretion, in the which better part I"
3104,Henry IV,28,5.4.124,FALSTAFF,"have saved my life.'Zounds, I am afraid of this"
3105,Henry IV,28,5.4.125,FALSTAFF,"gunpowder Percy, though he be dead: how, if he"
3106,Henry IV,28,5.4.126,FALSTAFF,"should counterfeit too and rise? by my faith, I am"
3107,Henry IV,28,5.4.127,FALSTAFF,afraid he would prove the better counterfeit.
3108,Henry IV,28,5.4.128,FALSTAFF,"Therefore I'll make him sure, yea, and I'll swear I"
3109,Henry IV,28,5.4.129,FALSTAFF,killed him. Why may not he rise as well as I?
3110,Henry IV,28,5.4.130,FALSTAFF,"Nothing confutes me but eyes, and nobody sees me."
3111,Henry IV,28,5.4.131,FALSTAFF,"Therefore, sirrah,"
3112,Henry IV,28,,FALSTAFF,Stabbing him
3113,Henry IV,28,5.4.132,FALSTAFF,"with a new wound in your thigh, come you along with me."
3114,Henry IV,28,,FALSTAFF,Takes up HOTSPUR on his back
3115,Henry IV,28,,FALSTAFF,Re-enter PRINCE HENRY and LORD JOHN OF LANCASTER
3116,Henry IV,29,5.4.133,PRINCE HENRY,"Come, brother John, full bravely hast thou flesh'd"
3117,Henry IV,29,5.4.134,PRINCE HENRY,Thy maiden sword.
3118,Henry IV,30,5.4.135,LANCASTER,"But, soft! whom have we here?"
3119,Henry IV,30,5.4.136,LANCASTER,Did you not tell me this fat man was dead?
3120,Henry IV,31,5.4.137,PRINCE HENRY,"I did, I saw him dead,"
3121,Henry IV,31,5.4.138,PRINCE HENRY,Breathless and bleeding on the ground. Art
3122,Henry IV,31,5.4.139,PRINCE HENRY,thou alive?
3123,Henry IV,31,5.4.140,PRINCE HENRY,Or is it fantasy that plays upon our eyesight?
3124,Henry IV,31,5.4.141,PRINCE HENRY,"I prithee, speak, we will not trust our eyes"
3125,Henry IV,31,5.4.142,PRINCE HENRY,Without our ears: thou art not what thou seem'st.
3126,Henry IV,32,5.4.143,FALSTAFF,"No, that's certain, I am not a double man: but if I"
3127,Henry IV,32,5.4.144,FALSTAFF,"be not Jack Falstaff, then am I a Jack. There is Percy:"
3128,Henry IV,32,,FALSTAFF,Throwing the body down
3129,Henry IV,32,5.4.145,FALSTAFF,"if your father will do me any honour, so, if not, let"
3130,Henry IV,32,5.4.146,FALSTAFF,him kill the next Percy himself. I look to be either
3131,Henry IV,32,5.4.147,FALSTAFF,"earl or duke, I can assure you."
3132,Henry IV,33,5.4.148,PRINCE HENRY,"Why, Percy I killed myself and saw thee dead."
3133,Henry IV,34,5.4.149,FALSTAFF,"Didst thou? Lord, Lord, how this world is given to"
3134,Henry IV,34,5.4.150,FALSTAFF,"lying! I grant you I was down and out of breath,"
3135,Henry IV,34,5.4.151,FALSTAFF,and so was he: but we rose both at an instant and
3136,Henry IV,34,5.4.152,FALSTAFF,fought a long hour by Shrewsbury clock. If I may be
3137,Henry IV,34,5.4.153,FALSTAFF,"believed, so, if not, let them that should reward"
3138,Henry IV,34,5.4.154,FALSTAFF,valour bear the sin upon their own heads. I'll take
3139,Henry IV,34,5.4.155,FALSTAFF,"it upon my death, I gave him this wound in the"
3140,Henry IV,34,5.4.156,FALSTAFF,"thigh: if the man were alive and would deny it,"
3141,Henry IV,34,5.4.157,FALSTAFF,"'zounds, I would make him eat a piece of my sword."
3142,Henry IV,35,5.4.158,LANCASTER,This is the strangest tale that ever I heard.
3143,Henry IV,36,5.4.159,PRINCE HENRY,"This is the strangest fellow, brother John."
3144,Henry IV,36,5.4.160,PRINCE HENRY,"Come, bring your luggage nobly on your back:"
3145,Henry IV,36,5.4.161,PRINCE HENRY,"For my part, if a lie may do thee grace,"
3146,Henry IV,36,5.4.162,PRINCE HENRY,I'll gild it with the happiest terms I have.
3147,Henry IV,36,,PRINCE HENRY,A retreat is sounded
3148,Henry IV,36,5.4.163,PRINCE HENRY,"The trumpet sounds retreat, the day is ours."
3149,Henry IV,36,5.4.164,PRINCE HENRY,"Come, brother, let us to the highest of the field,"
3150,Henry IV,36,5.4.165,PRINCE HENRY,"To see what friends are living, who are dead."
3151,Henry IV,36,,PRINCE HENRY,Exeunt PRINCE HENRY and LANCASTER
3152,Henry IV,37,5.4.166,FALSTAFF,"I'll follow, as they say, for reward. He that"
3153,Henry IV,37,5.4.167,FALSTAFF,"rewards me, God reward him! If I do grow great,"
3154,Henry IV,37,5.4.168,FALSTAFF,"I'll grow less, for I'll purge, and leave sack, and"
3155,Henry IV,37,5.4.169,FALSTAFF,live cleanly as a nobleman should do.
3156,Henry IV,37,,FALSTAFF,Exit

3178,Henry IV,4,5.5.19,PRINCE HENRY,"The noble Percy slain, and all his men"
3179,Henry IV,4,5.5.20,PRINCE HENRY,"Upon the foot of fear, fled with the rest,"
3180,Henry IV,4,5.5.21,PRINCE HENRY,"And falling from a hill, he was so bruised"
3181,Henry IV,4,5.5.22,PRINCE HENRY,That the pursuers took him. At my tent

3213,Henry VI Part 1,1,1.1.5,BEDFORD,That have consented unto Henry's death!
3214,Henry VI Part 1,1,1.1.6,BEDFORD,"King Henry the Fifth, too famous to live long!"
3215,Henry VI Part 1,1,1.1.7,BEDFORD,England ne'er lost a king of so much worth.
3216,Henry VI Part 1,2,1.1.8,GLOUCESTER,England ne'er had a king until his time.
3217,Henry VI Part 1,2,1.1.9,GLOUCESTER,"Virtue he had, deserving to command:"
3218,Henry VI Part 1,2,1.1.10,GLOUCESTER,His brandish'd sword did blind men with his beams:

3220,Henry VI Part 1,2,1.1.12,GLOUCESTER,"His sparking eyes, replete with wrathful fire,"
3221,Henry VI Part 1,2,1.1.13,GLOUCESTER,More dazzled and drove back his enemies
3222,Henry VI Part 1,2,1.1.14,GLOUCESTER,Than mid-day sun fierce bent against their faces.
3223,Henry VI Part 1,2,1.1.15,GLOUCESTER,What should I say? his deeds exceed all speech:
3224,Henry VI Part 1,2,1.1.16,GLOUCESTER,He ne'er lift up his hand but conquered.
3225,Henry VI Part 1,3,1.1.17,EXETER,We mourn in black: why mourn we not in blood?
3226,Henry VI Part 1,3,1.1.18,EXETER,Henry is dead and never shall revive:
3227,Henry VI Part 1,3,1.1.19,EXETER,"Upon a wooden coffin we attend,"

3231,Henry VI Part 1,3,1.1.23,EXETER,What! shall we curse the planets of mishap
3232,Henry VI Part 1,3,1.1.24,EXETER,That plotted thus our glory's overthrow?

3239,Henry VI Part 1,4,1.1.31,OF WINCHESTER,So dreadful will not be as was his sight.
3240,Henry VI Part 1,4,1.1.32,OF WINCHESTER,The battles of the Lord of hosts he fought:
3241,Henry VI Part 1,4,1.1.33,OF WINCHESTER,The church's prayers made him so prosperous.
3242,Henry VI Part 1,5,1.1.34,GLOUCESTER,"The church! where is it? Had not churchmen pray'd,"
3243,Henry VI Part 1,5,1.1.35,GLOUCESTER,His thread of life had not so soon decay'd:
3244,Henry VI Part 1,5,1.1.36,GLOUCESTER,"None do you like but an effeminate prince,"
3245,Henry VI Part 1,5,1.1.37,GLOUCESTER,"Whom, like a school-boy, you may over-awe."

3252,Henry VI Part 1,7,1.1.44,GLOUCESTER,And ne'er throughout the year to church thou go'st
3253,Henry VI Part 1,7,1.1.45,GLOUCESTER,Except it be to pray against thy foes.
3254,Henry VI Part 1,8,1.1.46,BEDFORD,"Cease, cease these jars and rest your minds in peace:"
3255,Henry VI Part 1,8,1.1.47,BEDFORD,"Let's to the altar: heralds, wait on us:"
3256,Henry VI Part 1,8,1.1.48,BEDFORD,"Instead of gold, we'll offer up our arms:"
3257,Henry VI Part 1,8,1.1.49,BEDFORD,Since arms avail not now that Henry's dead.
3258,Henry VI Part 1,8,1.1.50,BEDFORD,"Posterity, await for wretched years,"
3259,Henry VI Part 1,8,1.1.51,BEDFORD,"When at their mothers' moist eyes babes shall suck,"
3260,Henry VI Part 1,8,1.1.52,BEDFORD,"Our isle be made a nourish of salt tears,"

3275,Henry VI Part 1,10,1.1.66,BEDFORD,Will make him burst his lead and rise from death.
3276,Henry VI Part 1,11,1.1.67,GLOUCESTER,Is Paris lost? is Rouen yielded up?
3277,Henry VI Part 1,11,1.1.68,GLOUCESTER,"If Henry were recall'd to life again,"
3278,Henry VI Part 1,11,1.1.69,GLOUCESTER,These news would cause him once more yield the ghost.
3279,Henry VI Part 1,12,1.1.70,EXETER,How were they lost? what treachery was used?
3280,Henry VI Part 1,13,1.1.71,Messenger,"No treachery, but want of men and money."
3281,Henry VI Part 1,13,1.1.72,Messenger,"Amongst the soldiers this is muttered,"
3282,Henry VI Part 1,13,1.1.73,Messenger,"That here you maintain several factions,"
3283,Henry VI Part 1,13,1.1.74,Messenger,"And whilst a field should be dispatch'd and fought,"
3284,Henry VI Part 1,13,1.1.75,Messenger,You are disputing of your generals:
3285,Henry VI Part 1,13,1.1.76,Messenger,"One would have lingering wars with little cost,"
3286,Henry VI Part 1,13,1.1.77,Messenger,"Another would fly swift, but wanteth wings,"

3292,Henry VI Part 1,13,1.1.83,Messenger,Of England's coat one half is cut away.
3293,Henry VI Part 1,14,1.1.84,EXETER,"Were our tears wanting to this funeral,"
3294,Henry VI Part 1,14,1.1.85,EXETER,These tidings would call forth their flowing tides.
3295,Henry VI Part 1,15,1.1.86,BEDFORD,"Me they concern, Regent I am of France."
3296,Henry VI Part 1,15,1.1.87,BEDFORD,Give me my steeled coat. I'll fight for France.
3297,Henry VI Part 1,15,1.1.88,BEDFORD,Away with these disgraceful wailing robes!
3298,Henry VI Part 1,15,1.1.89,BEDFORD,"Wounds will I lend the French instead of eyes,"
3299,Henry VI Part 1,15,1.1.90,BEDFORD,To weep their intermissive miseries.
3300,Henry VI Part 1,15,,BEDFORD,Enter to them another Messenger
3301,Henry VI Part 1,16,1.1.91,Messenger,"Lords, view these letters full of bad mischance."

3303,Henry VI Part 1,16,1.1.93,Messenger,Except some petty towns of no import:

3310,Henry VI Part 1,18,1.1.100,GLOUCESTER,"We will not fly, but to our enemies' throats."
3311,Henry VI Part 1,18,1.1.101,GLOUCESTER,"Bedford, if thou be slack, I'll fight it out."
3312,Henry VI Part 1,19,1.1.102,BEDFORD,"Gloucester, why doubt'st thou of my forwardness?"
3313,Henry VI Part 1,19,1.1.103,BEDFORD,"An army have I muster'd in my thoughts,"

3332,Henry VI Part 1,22,1.1.121,Messenger,"They pitched in the ground confusedly,"
3333,Henry VI Part 1,22,1.1.122,Messenger,To keep the horsemen off from breaking in.
3334,Henry VI Part 1,22,1.1.123,Messenger,"More than three hours the fight continued,"
3335,Henry VI Part 1,22,1.1.124,Messenger,Where valiant Talbot above human thought
3336,Henry VI Part 1,22,1.1.125,Messenger,Enacted wonders with his sword and lance:

3374,Henry VI Part 1,26,1.1.163,Messenger,"And hardly keeps his men from mutiny,"
3375,Henry VI Part 1,26,1.1.164,Messenger,"Since they, so few, watch such a multitude."
3376,Henry VI Part 1,27,1.1.165,EXETER,"Remember, lords, your oaths to Henry sworn,"
3377,Henry VI Part 1,27,1.1.166,EXETER,"Either to quell the Dauphin utterly,"

3431,Henry VI Part 1,7,1.2.31,ALENCON,During the time Edward the Third did reign.
3432,Henry VI Part 1,7,1.2.32,ALENCON,"More truly now may this be verified,"
3433,Henry VI Part 1,7,1.2.33,ALENCON,For none but Samsons and Goliases
3434,Henry VI Part 1,7,1.2.34,ALENCON,It sendeth forth to skirmish. One to ten!
3435,Henry VI Part 1,7,1.2.35,ALENCON,"Lean, raw-boned rascals! who would e'er suppose"
3436,Henry VI Part 1,7,1.2.36,ALENCON,They had such courage and audacity?
3437,Henry VI Part 1,8,1.2.37,CHARLES,"Let's leave this town, for they are hare-brain'd slaves,"
3438,Henry VI Part 1,8,1.2.38,CHARLES,And hunger will enforce them to be more eager:
3439,Henry VI Part 1,8,1.2.39,CHARLES,"Of old I know them, rather with their teeth"
3440,Henry VI Part 1,8,1.2.40,CHARLES,The walls they'll tear down than forsake the siege.
3441,Henry VI Part 1,9,1.2.41,REIGNIER,"I think, by some odd gimmors or device"
3442,Henry VI Part 1,9,1.2.42,REIGNIER,"Their arms are set like clocks, stiff to strike on,"
3443,Henry VI Part 1,9,1.2.43,REIGNIER,Else ne'er could they hold out so as they do.
3444,Henry VI Part 1,9,1.2.44,REIGNIER,"By my consent, we'll even let them alone."
3445,Henry VI Part 1,10,1.2.45,ALENCON,Be it so.
3446,Henry VI Part 1,10,,ALENCON,Enter the BASTARD OF ORLEANS
3447,Henry VI Part 1,11,1.2.46,BASTARD OF ORLEANS,Where's the Prince Dauphin? I have news for him.
3448,Henry VI Part 1,12,1.2.47,CHARLES,"Bastard of Orleans, thrice welcome to us."
3449,Henry VI Part 1,13,1.2.48,BASTARD OF ORLEANS,"Methinks your looks are sad, your cheer appall'd:"
3450,Henry VI Part 1,13,1.2.49,BASTARD OF ORLEANS,Hath the late overthrow wrought this offence?
3451,Henry VI Part 1,13,1.2.50,BASTARD OF ORLEANS,"Be not dismay'd, for succor is at hand:"
3452,Henry VI Part 1,13,1.2.51,BASTARD OF ORLEANS,"A holy maid hither with me I bring,"
3453,Henry VI Part 1,13,1.2.52,BASTARD OF ORLEANS,Which by a vision sent to her from heaven
3454,Henry VI Part 1,13,1.2.53,BASTARD OF ORLEANS,Ordained is to raise this tedious siege
3455,Henry VI Part 1,13,1.2.54,BASTARD OF ORLEANS,And drive the English forth the bounds of France.
3456,Henry VI Part 1,13,1.2.55,BASTARD OF ORLEANS,"The spirit of deep prophecy she hath,"
3457,Henry VI Part 1,13,1.2.56,BASTARD OF ORLEANS,Exceeding the nine sibyls of old Rome:
3458,Henry VI Part 1,13,1.2.57,BASTARD OF ORLEANS,What's past and what's to come she can descry.
3459,Henry VI Part 1,13,1.2.58,BASTARD OF ORLEANS,"Speak, shall I call her in? Believe my words,"
3460,Henry VI Part 1,13,1.2.59,BASTARD OF ORLEANS,For they are certain and unfallible.
3461,Henry VI Part 1,14,1.2.60,CHARLES,"Go, call her in."
3462,Henry VI Part 1,14,,CHARLES,Exit BASTARD OF ORLEANS
3463,Henry VI Part 1,14,1.2.61,CHARLES,"But first, to try her skill,"
3464,Henry VI Part 1,14,1.2.62,CHARLES,"Reignier, stand thou as Dauphin in my place:"
3465,Henry VI Part 1,14,1.2.63,CHARLES,"Question her proudly, let thy looks be stern:"
3466,Henry VI Part 1,14,1.2.64,CHARLES,By this means shall we sound what skill she hath.
3467,Henry VI Part 1,14,,CHARLES,"Re-enter the BASTARD OF ORLEANS, with JOAN LA PUCELLE"
3468,Henry VI Part 1,15,1.2.65,REIGNIER,"Fair maid, is't thou wilt do these wondrous feats?"
3469,Henry VI Part 1,16,1.2.66,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Reignier, is't thou that thinkest to beguile me?"
3470,Henry VI Part 1,16,1.2.67,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Where is the Dauphin? Come, come from behind,"
3471,Henry VI Part 1,16,1.2.68,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"I know thee well, though never seen before."
3472,Henry VI Part 1,16,1.2.69,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Be not amazed, there's nothing hid from me:"
3473,Henry VI Part 1,16,1.2.70,JOAN LA PUCELLE,In private will I talk with thee apart.
3474,Henry VI Part 1,16,1.2.71,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Stand back, you lords, and give us leave awhile."
3475,Henry VI Part 1,17,1.2.72,REIGNIER,She takes upon her bravely at first dash.
3476,Henry VI Part 1,18,1.2.73,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Dauphin, I am by birth a shepherd's daughter,"
3477,Henry VI Part 1,18,1.2.74,JOAN LA PUCELLE,My wit untrain'd in any kind of art.
3478,Henry VI Part 1,18,1.2.75,JOAN LA PUCELLE,Heaven and our Lady gracious hath it pleased
3479,Henry VI Part 1,18,1.2.76,JOAN LA PUCELLE,To shine on my contemptible estate:
3480,Henry VI Part 1,18,1.2.77,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Lo, whilst I waited on my tender lambs,"
3481,Henry VI Part 1,18,1.2.78,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"And to sun's parching heat display'd my cheeks,"
3482,Henry VI Part 1,18,1.2.79,JOAN LA PUCELLE,God's mother deigned to appear to me
3483,Henry VI Part 1,18,1.2.80,JOAN LA PUCELLE,And in a vision full of majesty
3484,Henry VI Part 1,18,1.2.81,JOAN LA PUCELLE,Will'd me to leave my base vocation
3485,Henry VI Part 1,18,1.2.82,JOAN LA PUCELLE,And free my country from calamity:
3486,Henry VI Part 1,18,1.2.83,JOAN LA PUCELLE,Her aid she promised and assured success:
3487,Henry VI Part 1,18,1.2.84,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"In complete glory she reveal'd herself,"
3488,Henry VI Part 1,18,1.2.85,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"And, whereas I was black and swart before,"
3489,Henry VI Part 1,18,1.2.86,JOAN LA PUCELLE,With those clear rays which she infused on me
3490,Henry VI Part 1,18,1.2.87,JOAN LA PUCELLE,That beauty am I bless'd with which you see.
3491,Henry VI Part 1,18,1.2.88,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Ask me what question thou canst possible,"
3492,Henry VI Part 1,18,1.2.89,JOAN LA PUCELLE,And I will answer unpremeditated:
3493,Henry VI Part 1,18,1.2.90,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"My courage try by combat, if thou darest,"
3494,Henry VI Part 1,18,1.2.91,JOAN LA PUCELLE,And thou shalt find that I exceed my sex.
3495,Henry VI Part 1,18,1.2.92,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Resolve on this, thou shalt be fortunate,"
3496,Henry VI Part 1,18,1.2.93,JOAN LA PUCELLE,If thou receive me for thy warlike mate.
3497,Henry VI Part 1,19,1.2.94,CHARLES,Thou hast astonish'd me with thy high terms:
3498,Henry VI Part 1,19,1.2.95,CHARLES,"Only this proof I'll of thy valour make,"
3499,Henry VI Part 1,19,1.2.96,CHARLES,"In single combat thou shalt buckle with me,"
3500,Henry VI Part 1,19,1.2.97,CHARLES,"And if thou vanquishest, thy words are true,"
3501,Henry VI Part 1,19,1.2.98,CHARLES,Otherwise I renounce all confidence.
3502,Henry VI Part 1,20,1.2.99,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"I am prepared: here is my keen-edged sword,"
3503,Henry VI Part 1,20,1.2.100,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Deck'd with five flower-de-luces on each side,"
3504,Henry VI Part 1,20,1.2.101,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"The which at Touraine, in Saint Katharine's"
3505,Henry VI Part 1,20,1.2.102,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"churchyard,"
3506,Henry VI Part 1,20,1.2.103,JOAN LA PUCELLE,Out of a great deal of old iron I chose forth.
3507,Henry VI Part 1,21,1.2.104,CHARLES,"Then come, o' God's name, I fear no woman."
3508,Henry VI Part 1,22,1.2.105,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"And while I live, I'll ne'er fly from a man."
3509,Henry VI Part 1,22,,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Here they fight, and JOAN LA PUCELLE overcomes"
3510,Henry VI Part 1,23,1.2.106,CHARLES,"Stay, stay thy hands! thou art an Amazon"
3511,Henry VI Part 1,23,1.2.107,CHARLES,And fightest with the sword of Deborah.
3512,Henry VI Part 1,24,1.2.108,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Christ's mother helps me, else I were too weak."
3513,Henry VI Part 1,25,1.2.109,CHARLES,"Whoe'er helps thee, 'tis thou that must help me:"
3514,Henry VI Part 1,25,1.2.110,CHARLES,"Impatiently I burn with thy desire,"
3515,Henry VI Part 1,25,1.2.111,CHARLES,My heart and hands thou hast at once subdued.
3516,Henry VI Part 1,25,1.2.112,CHARLES,"Excellent Pucelle, if thy name be so,"
3517,Henry VI Part 1,25,1.2.113,CHARLES,Let me thy servant and not sovereign be:
3518,Henry VI Part 1,25,1.2.114,CHARLES,'Tis the French Dauphin sueth to thee thus.
3519,Henry VI Part 1,26,1.2.115,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"I must not yield to any rites of love,"
3520,Henry VI Part 1,26,1.2.116,JOAN LA PUCELLE,For my profession's sacred from above:
3521,Henry VI Part 1,26,1.2.117,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"When I have chased all thy foes from hence,"
3522,Henry VI Part 1,26,1.2.118,JOAN LA PUCELLE,Then will I think upon a recompense.
3523,Henry VI Part 1,27,1.2.119,CHARLES,Meantime look gracious on thy prostrate thrall.
3524,Henry VI Part 1,28,1.2.120,REIGNIER,"My lord, methinks, is very long in talk."
3525,Henry VI Part 1,29,1.2.121,ALENCON,"Doubtless he shrives this woman to her smock,"
3526,Henry VI Part 1,29,1.2.122,ALENCON,Else ne'er could he so long protract his speech.
3527,Henry VI Part 1,30,1.2.123,REIGNIER,"Shall we disturb him, since he keeps no mean?"
3528,Henry VI Part 1,31,1.2.124,ALENCON,He may mean more than we poor men do know:
3529,Henry VI Part 1,31,1.2.125,ALENCON,These women are shrewd tempters with their tongues.
3530,Henry VI Part 1,32,1.2.126,REIGNIER,"My lord, where are you? what devise you on?"
3531,Henry VI Part 1,32,1.2.127,REIGNIER,"Shall we give over Orleans, or no?"
3532,Henry VI Part 1,33,1.2.128,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Why, no, I say, distrustful recreants!"
3533,Henry VI Part 1,33,1.2.129,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Fight till the last gasp, I will be your guard."
3534,Henry VI Part 1,34,1.2.130,CHARLES,What she says I'll confirm: we'll fight it out.
3535,Henry VI Part 1,35,1.2.131,JOAN LA PUCELLE,Assign'd am I to be the English scourge.
3536,Henry VI Part 1,35,1.2.132,JOAN LA PUCELLE,This night the siege assuredly I'll raise:
3537,Henry VI Part 1,35,1.2.133,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Expect Saint Martin's summer, halcyon days,"
3538,Henry VI Part 1,35,1.2.134,JOAN LA PUCELLE,Since I have entered into these wars.
3539,Henry VI Part 1,35,1.2.135,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Glory is like a circle in the water,"
3540,Henry VI Part 1,35,1.2.136,JOAN LA PUCELLE,Which never ceaseth to enlarge itself
3541,Henry VI Part 1,35,1.2.137,JOAN LA PUCELLE,Till by broad spreading it disperse to nought.
3542,Henry VI Part 1,35,1.2.138,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"With Henry's death the English circle ends,"
3543,Henry VI Part 1,35,1.2.139,JOAN LA PUCELLE,Dispersed are the glories it included.
3544,Henry VI Part 1,35,1.2.140,JOAN LA PUCELLE,Now am I like that proud insulting ship
3545,Henry VI Part 1,35,1.2.141,JOAN LA PUCELLE,Which Caesar and his fortune bare at once.
3546,Henry VI Part 1,36,1.2.142,CHARLES,Was Mahomet inspired with a dove?
3547,Henry VI Part 1,36,1.2.143,CHARLES,Thou with an eagle art inspired then.
3548,Henry VI Part 1,36,1.2.144,CHARLES,"Helen, the mother of great Constantine,"
3549,Henry VI Part 1,36,1.2.145,CHARLES,"Nor yet Saint Philip's daughters, were like thee."
3550,Henry VI Part 1,36,1.2.146,CHARLES,"Bright star of Venus, fall'n down on the earth,"
3551,Henry VI Part 1,36,1.2.147,CHARLES,How may I reverently worship thee enough?
3552,Henry VI Part 1,37,1.2.148,ALENCON,"Leave off delays, and let us raise the siege."
3553,Henry VI Part 1,38,1.2.149,REIGNIER,"Woman, do what thou canst to save our honours,"
3554,Henry VI Part 1,38,1.2.150,REIGNIER,Drive them from Orleans and be immortalized.
3555,Henry VI Part 1,39,1.2.151,CHARLES,"Presently we'll try: come, let's away about it:"
3556,Henry VI Part 1,39,1.2.152,CHARLES,"No prophet will I trust, if she prove false."
3557,Henry VI Part 1,39,,CHARLES,Exeunt
3558,Henry VI Part 1,39,,CHARLES,SCENE III. London. Before the Tower.
3559,Henry VI Part 1,39,,CHARLES,"Enter GLOUCESTER, with his Serving-men in blue coats"
3560,Henry VI Part 1,1,1.3.1,GLOUCESTER,I am come to survey the Tower this day:
3561,Henry VI Part 1,1,1.3.2,GLOUCESTER,"Since Henry's death, I fear, there is conveyance."
3562,Henry VI Part 1,1,1.3.3,GLOUCESTER,"Where be these warders, that they wait not here?"
3563,Henry VI Part 1,1,1.3.4,GLOUCESTER,"Open the gates, 'tis Gloucester that calls."
3564,Henry VI Part 1,2,1.3.5,First Warder,[Within]  Who's there that knocks so imperiously?
3565,Henry VI Part 1,2,1.3.6,First Warder,"First Serving-Man	It is the noble Duke of Gloucester."

3567,Henry VI Part 1,3,1.3.8,Second Warder,"First Serving-Man	Villains, answer you so the lord protector?"
3568,Henry VI Part 1,4,1.3.9,First Warder,[Within]  The Lord protect him! so we answer him:
3569,Henry VI Part 1,4,1.3.10,First Warder,We do no otherwise than we are will'd.
3570,Henry VI Part 1,5,1.3.11,GLOUCESTER,Who willed you? or whose will stands but mine?
3571,Henry VI Part 1,5,1.3.12,GLOUCESTER,There's none protector of the realm but I.
3572,Henry VI Part 1,5,1.3.13,GLOUCESTER,"Break up the gates, I'll be your warrantize."
3573,Henry VI Part 1,5,1.3.14,GLOUCESTER,Shall I be flouted thus by dunghill grooms?
3574,Henry VI Part 1,5,,GLOUCESTER,"Gloucester's men rush at the Tower Gates, and WOODVILE the Lieutenant speaks within"
3575,Henry VI Part 1,6,1.3.15,WOODVILE,What noise is this? what traitors have we here?
3576,Henry VI Part 1,7,1.3.16,GLOUCESTER,"Lieutenant, is it you whose voice I hear?"
3577,Henry VI Part 1,7,1.3.17,GLOUCESTER,"Open the gates, here's Gloucester that would enter."
3578,Henry VI Part 1,8,1.3.18,WOODVILE,"Have patience, noble duke, I may not open,"
3579,Henry VI Part 1,8,1.3.19,WOODVILE,The Cardinal of Winchester forbids:
3580,Henry VI Part 1,8,1.3.20,WOODVILE,From him I have express commandment
3581,Henry VI Part 1,8,1.3.21,WOODVILE,That thou nor none of thine shall be let in.
3582,Henry VI Part 1,9,1.3.22,GLOUCESTER,"Faint-hearted Woodvile, prizest him 'fore me?"
3583,Henry VI Part 1,9,1.3.23,GLOUCESTER,"Arrogant Winchester, that haughty prelate,"
3584,Henry VI Part 1,9,1.3.24,GLOUCESTER,"Whom Henry, our late sovereign, ne'er could brook?"
3585,Henry VI Part 1,9,1.3.25,GLOUCESTER,Thou art no friend to God or to the king:
3586,Henry VI Part 1,9,1.3.26,GLOUCESTER,"Open the gates, or I'll shut thee out shortly."
3587,Henry VI Part 1,9,1.3.27,GLOUCESTER,"Serving-Men	Open the gates unto the lord protector,"

3592,Henry VI Part 1,11,1.3.31,GLOUCESTER,"Peel'd priest, dost thou command me to be shut out?"
3593,Henry VI Part 1,11,1.3.32,GLOUCESTER,BISHOP
3594,Henry VI Part 1,12,1.3.33,OF WINCHESTER,"I do, thou most usurping proditor,"

3596,Henry VI Part 1,13,1.3.35,GLOUCESTER,"Stand back, thou manifest conspirator,"
3597,Henry VI Part 1,13,1.3.36,GLOUCESTER,"Thou that contrivedst to murder our dead lord,"
3598,Henry VI Part 1,13,1.3.37,GLOUCESTER,Thou that givest whores indulgences to sin:
3599,Henry VI Part 1,13,1.3.38,GLOUCESTER,"I'll canvass thee in thy broad cardinal's hat,"
3600,Henry VI Part 1,13,1.3.39,GLOUCESTER,If thou proceed in this thy insolence.
3601,Henry VI Part 1,13,1.3.40,GLOUCESTER,BISHOP
3602,Henry VI Part 1,14,1.3.41,OF WINCHESTER,"Nay, stand thou back, I will not budge a foot:"

3605,Henry VI Part 1,15,1.3.44,GLOUCESTER,"I will not slay thee, but I'll drive thee back:"
3606,Henry VI Part 1,15,1.3.45,GLOUCESTER,Thy scarlet robes as a child's bearing-cloth
3607,Henry VI Part 1,15,1.3.46,GLOUCESTER,I'll use to carry thee out of this place.

3611,Henry VI Part 1,17,1.3.50,GLOUCESTER,"Draw, men, for all this privileged place,"
3612,Henry VI Part 1,17,1.3.51,GLOUCESTER,"Blue coats to tawny coats. Priest, beware your beard,"
3613,Henry VI Part 1,17,1.3.52,GLOUCESTER,I mean to tug it and to cuff you soundly:
3614,Henry VI Part 1,17,1.3.53,GLOUCESTER,Under my feet I stamp thy cardinal's hat:
3615,Henry VI Part 1,17,1.3.54,GLOUCESTER,"In spite of pope or dignities of church,"
3616,Henry VI Part 1,17,1.3.55,GLOUCESTER,Here by the cheeks I'll drag thee up and down.
3617,Henry VI Part 1,17,1.3.56,GLOUCESTER,BISHOP
3618,Henry VI Part 1,18,1.3.57,OF WINCHESTER,"Gloucester, thou wilt answer this before the pope."
3619,Henry VI Part 1,19,1.3.58,GLOUCESTER,"Winchester goose, I cry, a rope! a rope!"
3620,Henry VI Part 1,19,1.3.59,GLOUCESTER,"Now beat them hence, why do you let them stay?"
3621,Henry VI Part 1,19,1.3.60,GLOUCESTER,"Thee I'll chase hence, thou wolf in sheep's array."

3625,Henry VI Part 1,20,1.3.63,Mayor,Thus contumeliously should break the peace!

3633,Henry VI Part 1,22,1.3.71,OF WINCHESTER,"That seeks to overthrow religion,"
3634,Henry VI Part 1,22,1.3.72,OF WINCHESTER,"Because he is protector of the realm,"

3636,Henry VI Part 1,22,1.3.74,OF WINCHESTER,To crown himself king and suppress the prince.
3637,Henry VI Part 1,23,1.3.75,GLOUCESTER,"I will not answer thee with words, but blows."
3638,Henry VI Part 1,23,,GLOUCESTER,Here they skirmish again
3639,Henry VI Part 1,24,1.3.76,Mayor,Naught rests for me in this tumultuous strife
3640,Henry VI Part 1,24,1.3.77,Mayor,But to make open proclamation:
3641,Henry VI Part 1,24,1.3.78,Mayor,"Come, officer, as loud as e'er thou canst,"
3642,Henry VI Part 1,24,1.3.79,Mayor,Cry.
3643,Henry VI Part 1,25,1.3.80,Officer,All manner of men assembled here in arms this day
3644,Henry VI Part 1,25,1.3.81,Officer,"against God's peace and the king's, we charge and"
3645,Henry VI Part 1,25,1.3.82,Officer,"command you, in his highness' name, to repair to"
3646,Henry VI Part 1,25,1.3.83,Officer,"your several dwelling-places, and not to wear,"
3647,Henry VI Part 1,25,1.3.84,Officer,"handle, or use any sword, weapon, or dagger,"
3648,Henry VI Part 1,25,1.3.85,Officer,"henceforward, upon pain of death."
3649,Henry VI Part 1,26,1.3.86,GLOUCESTER,"Cardinal, I'll be no breaker of the law:"
3650,Henry VI Part 1,26,1.3.87,GLOUCESTER,"But we shall meet, and break our minds at large."
3651,Henry VI Part 1,26,1.3.88,GLOUCESTER,BISHOP
3652,Henry VI Part 1,27,1.3.89,OF WINCHESTER,"Gloucester, we will meet, to thy cost, be sure:"
3653,Henry VI Part 1,27,1.3.90,OF WINCHESTER,Thy heart-blood I will have for this day's work.
3654,Henry VI Part 1,28,1.3.91,Mayor,"I'll call for clubs, if you will not away."
3655,Henry VI Part 1,28,1.3.92,Mayor,This cardinal's more haughty than the devil.
3656,Henry VI Part 1,29,1.3.93,GLOUCESTER,"Mayor, farewell: thou dost but what thou mayst."
3657,Henry VI Part 1,29,1.3.94,GLOUCESTER,BISHOP
3658,Henry VI Part 1,30,1.3.95,OF WINCHESTER,"Abominable Gloucester, guard thy head,"
3659,Henry VI Part 1,30,1.3.96,OF WINCHESTER,For I intend to have it ere long.
3660,Henry VI Part 1,30,,OF WINCHESTER,"Exeunt, severally, GLOUCESTER and BISHOP OF WINCHESTER with their Serving-men"
3661,Henry VI Part 1,31,1.3.97,Mayor,"See the coast clear'd, and then we will depart."
3662,Henry VI Part 1,31,1.3.98,Mayor,"Good God, these nobles should such stomachs bear!"
3663,Henry VI Part 1,31,1.3.99,Mayor,I myself fight not once in forty year.
3664,Henry VI Part 1,31,,Mayor,Exeunt
3665,Henry VI Part 1,31,,Mayor,SCENE IV. Orleans.
3666,Henry VI Part 1,31,,Mayor,"Enter, on the walls, a Master Gunner and his Boy"
3667,Henry VI Part 1,31,1.4.1,Mayor,"Master-Gunner	Sirrah, thou know'st how Orleans is besieged,"
3668,Henry VI Part 1,31,1.4.2,Mayor,And how the English have the suburbs won.
3669,Henry VI Part 1,1,1.4.3,Boy,"Father, I know, and oft have shot at them,"
3670,Henry VI Part 1,1,1.4.4,Boy,Howe'er unfortunate I miss'd my aim.
3671,Henry VI Part 1,1,1.4.5,Boy,"Master-Gunner	But now thou shalt not. Be thou ruled by me:"
3672,Henry VI Part 1,1,1.4.6,Boy,"Chief master-gunner am I of this town,"
3673,Henry VI Part 1,1,1.4.7,Boy,Something I must do to procure me grace.
3674,Henry VI Part 1,1,1.4.8,Boy,The prince's espials have informed me
3675,Henry VI Part 1,1,1.4.9,Boy,"How the English, in the suburbs close intrench'd,"
3676,Henry VI Part 1,1,1.4.10,Boy,"Wont, through a secret grate of iron bars"
3677,Henry VI Part 1,1,1.4.11,Boy,"In yonder tower, to overpeer the city,"
3678,Henry VI Part 1,1,1.4.12,Boy,And thence discover how with most advantage
3679,Henry VI Part 1,1,1.4.13,Boy,"They may vex us with shot, or with assault."
3680,Henry VI Part 1,1,1.4.14,Boy,"To intercept this inconvenience,"
3681,Henry VI Part 1,1,1.4.15,Boy,"A piece of ordnance 'gainst it I have placed,"
3682,Henry VI Part 1,1,1.4.16,Boy,"And even these three days have I watch'd,"
3683,Henry VI Part 1,1,1.4.17,Boy,If I could see them.
3684,Henry VI Part 1,1,1.4.18,Boy,"Now do thou watch, for I can stay no longer."
3685,Henry VI Part 1,1,1.4.19,Boy,"If thou spy'st any, run and bring me word,"
3686,Henry VI Part 1,1,1.4.20,Boy,And thou shalt find me at the governor's.
3687,Henry VI Part 1,1,,Boy,Exit
3688,Henry VI Part 1,2,1.4.21,Boy,"Father, I warrant you, take you no care,"
3689,Henry VI Part 1,2,1.4.22,Boy,"I'll never trouble you, if I may spy them."
3690,Henry VI Part 1,2,,Boy,Exit
3691,Henry VI Part 1,2,,Boy,"Enter, on the turrets, SALISBURY and TALBOT, GLANSDALE, GARGRAVE, and others"
3692,Henry VI Part 1,3,1.4.23,SALISBURY,"Talbot, my life, my joy, again return'd!"
3693,Henry VI Part 1,3,1.4.24,SALISBURY,How wert thou handled being prisoner?
3694,Henry VI Part 1,3,1.4.25,SALISBURY,Or by what means got'st thou to be released?
3695,Henry VI Part 1,3,1.4.26,SALISBURY,"Discourse, I prithee, on this turret's top."
3696,Henry VI Part 1,4,1.4.27,TALBOT,The Duke of Bedford had a prisoner
3697,Henry VI Part 1,4,1.4.28,TALBOT,"Call'd the brave Lord Ponton de Santrailles,"
3698,Henry VI Part 1,4,1.4.29,TALBOT,For him was I exchanged and ransomed.
3699,Henry VI Part 1,4,1.4.30,TALBOT,But with a baser man of arms by far
3700,Henry VI Part 1,4,1.4.31,TALBOT,Once in contempt they would have barter'd me:
3701,Henry VI Part 1,4,1.4.32,TALBOT,"Which I, disdaining, scorn'd, and craved death,"
3702,Henry VI Part 1,4,1.4.33,TALBOT,Rather than I would be so vile esteem'd.
3703,Henry VI Part 1,4,1.4.34,TALBOT,"In fine, redeem'd I was as I desired."
3704,Henry VI Part 1,4,1.4.35,TALBOT,"But, O! the treacherous Fastolfe wounds my heart,"
3705,Henry VI Part 1,4,1.4.36,TALBOT,"Whom with my bare fists I would execute,"
3706,Henry VI Part 1,4,1.4.37,TALBOT,If I now had him brought into my power.
3707,Henry VI Part 1,5,1.4.38,SALISBURY,Yet tell'st thou not how thou wert entertain'd.
3708,Henry VI Part 1,6,1.4.39,TALBOT,With scoffs and scorns and contumelious taunts.
3709,Henry VI Part 1,6,1.4.40,TALBOT,"In open market-place produced they me,"
3710,Henry VI Part 1,6,1.4.41,TALBOT,To be a public spectacle to all:
3711,Henry VI Part 1,6,1.4.42,TALBOT,"Here, said they, is the terror of the French,"
3712,Henry VI Part 1,6,1.4.43,TALBOT,The scarecrow that affrights our children so.
3713,Henry VI Part 1,6,1.4.44,TALBOT,"Then broke I from the officers that led me,"
3714,Henry VI Part 1,6,1.4.45,TALBOT,"And with my nails digg'd stones out of the ground,"
3715,Henry VI Part 1,6,1.4.46,TALBOT,To hurl at the beholders of my shame:
3716,Henry VI Part 1,6,1.4.47,TALBOT,"My grisly countenance made others fly,"
3717,Henry VI Part 1,6,1.4.48,TALBOT,None durst come near for fear of sudden death.
3718,Henry VI Part 1,6,1.4.49,TALBOT,"In iron walls they deem'd me not secure,"
3719,Henry VI Part 1,6,1.4.50,TALBOT,"So great fear of my name 'mongst them was spread,"
3720,Henry VI Part 1,6,1.4.51,TALBOT,"That they supposed I could rend bars of steel,"
3721,Henry VI Part 1,6,1.4.52,TALBOT,And spurn in pieces posts of adamant:
3722,Henry VI Part 1,6,1.4.53,TALBOT,"Wherefore a guard of chosen shot I had,"
3723,Henry VI Part 1,6,1.4.54,TALBOT,"That walked about me every minute-while,"
3724,Henry VI Part 1,6,1.4.55,TALBOT,"And if I did but stir out of my bed,"
3725,Henry VI Part 1,6,1.4.56,TALBOT,Ready they were to shoot me to the heart.
3726,Henry VI Part 1,6,,TALBOT,Enter the Boy with a linstock
3727,Henry VI Part 1,7,1.4.57,SALISBURY,"I grieve to hear what torments you endured,"
3728,Henry VI Part 1,7,1.4.58,SALISBURY,But we will be revenged sufficiently
3729,Henry VI Part 1,7,1.4.59,SALISBURY,Now it is supper-time in Orleans:
3730,Henry VI Part 1,7,1.4.60,SALISBURY,"Here, through this grate, I count each one"
3731,Henry VI Part 1,7,1.4.61,SALISBURY,and view the Frenchmen how they fortify:
3732,Henry VI Part 1,7,1.4.62,SALISBURY,"Let us look in, the sight will much delight thee."
3733,Henry VI Part 1,7,1.4.63,SALISBURY,"Sir Thomas Gargrave, and Sir William Glansdale,"
3734,Henry VI Part 1,7,1.4.64,SALISBURY,Let me have your express opinions
3735,Henry VI Part 1,7,1.4.65,SALISBURY,Where is best place to make our battery next.
3736,Henry VI Part 1,8,1.4.66,GARGRAVE,"I think, at the north gate, for there stand lords."
3737,Henry VI Part 1,9,1.4.67,GLANSDALE,"And I, here, at the bulwark of the bridge."
3738,Henry VI Part 1,10,1.4.68,TALBOT,"For aught I see, this city must be famish'd,"
3739,Henry VI Part 1,10,1.4.69,TALBOT,Or with light skirmishes enfeebled.
3740,Henry VI Part 1,10,,TALBOT,Here they shoot. SALISBURY and GARGRAVE fall
3741,Henry VI Part 1,11,1.4.70,SALISBURY,"O Lord, have mercy on us, wretched sinners!"
3742,Henry VI Part 1,12,1.4.71,GARGRAVE,"O Lord, have mercy on me, woful man!"
3743,Henry VI Part 1,13,1.4.72,TALBOT,What chance is this that suddenly hath cross'd us?
3744,Henry VI Part 1,13,1.4.73,TALBOT,"Speak, Salisbury, at least, if thou canst speak:"
3745,Henry VI Part 1,13,1.4.74,TALBOT,"How farest thou, mirror of all martial men?"
3746,Henry VI Part 1,13,1.4.75,TALBOT,One of thy eyes and thy cheek's side struck off!
3747,Henry VI Part 1,13,1.4.76,TALBOT,Accursed tower! accursed fatal hand
3748,Henry VI Part 1,13,1.4.77,TALBOT,That hath contrived this woful tragedy!
3749,Henry VI Part 1,13,1.4.78,TALBOT,"In thirteen battles Salisbury o'ercame,"
3750,Henry VI Part 1,13,1.4.79,TALBOT,"Henry the Fifth he first train'd to the wars,"
3751,Henry VI Part 1,13,1.4.80,TALBOT,"Whilst any trump did sound, or drum struck up,"
3752,Henry VI Part 1,13,1.4.81,TALBOT,His sword did ne'er leave striking in the field.
3753,Henry VI Part 1,13,1.4.82,TALBOT,"Yet livest thou, Salisbury? though thy speech doth fail,"
3754,Henry VI Part 1,13,1.4.83,TALBOT,"One eye thou hast, to look to heaven for grace:"
3755,Henry VI Part 1,13,1.4.84,TALBOT,The sun with one eye vieweth all the world.
3756,Henry VI Part 1,13,1.4.85,TALBOT,"Heaven, be thou gracious to none alive,"
3757,Henry VI Part 1,13,1.4.86,TALBOT,If Salisbury wants mercy at thy hands!
3758,Henry VI Part 1,13,1.4.87,TALBOT,"Bear hence his body, I will help to bury it."
3759,Henry VI Part 1,13,1.4.88,TALBOT,"Sir Thomas Gargrave, hast thou any life?"
3760,Henry VI Part 1,13,1.4.89,TALBOT,"Speak unto Talbot, nay, look up to him."
3761,Henry VI Part 1,13,1.4.90,TALBOT,"Salisbury, cheer thy spirit with this comfort,"
3762,Henry VI Part 1,13,1.4.91,TALBOT,Thou shalt not die whiles--
3763,Henry VI Part 1,13,1.4.92,TALBOT,He beckons with his hand and smiles on me.
3764,Henry VI Part 1,13,1.4.93,TALBOT,"As who should say 'When I am dead and gone,"
3765,Henry VI Part 1,13,1.4.94,TALBOT,Remember to avenge me on the French.'
3766,Henry VI Part 1,13,1.4.95,TALBOT,"Plantagenet, I will, and like thee, Nero,"
3767,Henry VI Part 1,13,1.4.96,TALBOT,"Play on the lute, beholding the towns burn:"
3768,Henry VI Part 1,13,1.4.97,TALBOT,Wretched shall France be only in my name.
3769,Henry VI Part 1,13,,TALBOT,"Here an alarum, and it thunders and lightens"
3770,Henry VI Part 1,13,1.4.98,TALBOT,What stir is this? what tumult's in the heavens?
3771,Henry VI Part 1,13,1.4.99,TALBOT,Whence cometh this alarum and the noise?
3772,Henry VI Part 1,13,,TALBOT,Enter a Messenger
3773,Henry VI Part 1,14,1.4.100,Messenger,"My lord, my lord, the French have gathered head:"
3774,Henry VI Part 1,14,1.4.101,Messenger,"The Dauphin, with one Joan la Pucelle join'd,"
3775,Henry VI Part 1,14,1.4.102,Messenger,"A holy prophetess new risen up,"
3776,Henry VI Part 1,14,1.4.103,Messenger,Is come with a great power to raise the siege.
3777,Henry VI Part 1,14,,Messenger,Here SALISBURY lifteth himself up and groans
3778,Henry VI Part 1,15,1.4.104,TALBOT,"Hear, hear how dying Salisbury doth groan!"
3779,Henry VI Part 1,15,1.4.105,TALBOT,It irks his heart he cannot be revenged.
3780,Henry VI Part 1,15,1.4.106,TALBOT,"Frenchmen, I'll be a Salisbury to you:"
3781,Henry VI Part 1,15,1.4.107,TALBOT,"Pucelle or puzzel, dolphin or dogfish,"
3782,Henry VI Part 1,15,1.4.108,TALBOT,"Your hearts I'll stamp out with my horse's heels,"
3783,Henry VI Part 1,15,1.4.109,TALBOT,And make a quagmire of your mingled brains.
3784,Henry VI Part 1,15,1.4.110,TALBOT,"Convey me Salisbury into his tent,"
3785,Henry VI Part 1,15,1.4.111,TALBOT,And then we'll try what these dastard Frenchmen dare.
3786,Henry VI Part 1,15,,TALBOT,Alarum. Exeunt
3787,Henry VI Part 1,15,,TALBOT,SCENE V. The same.
3788,Henry VI Part 1,15,,TALBOT,"Here an alarum again: and TALBOT pursueth the  DAUPHIN, and driveth him: then enter JOAN LA  PUCELLE, driving Englishmen before her, and exit after them then re-enter TALBOT"
3789,Henry VI Part 1,1,1.5.1,TALBOT,"Where is my strength, my valour, and my force?"
3790,Henry VI Part 1,1,1.5.2,TALBOT,"Our English troops retire, I cannot stay them:"
3791,Henry VI Part 1,1,1.5.3,TALBOT,A woman clad in armour chaseth them.
3792,Henry VI Part 1,1,,TALBOT,Re-enter JOAN LA PUCELLE
3793,Henry VI Part 1,1,1.5.4,TALBOT,"Here, here she comes. I'll have a bout with thee,"
3794,Henry VI Part 1,1,1.5.5,TALBOT,"Devil or devil's dam, I'll conjure thee:"
3795,Henry VI Part 1,1,1.5.6,TALBOT,"Blood will I draw on thee, thou art a witch,"
3796,Henry VI Part 1,1,1.5.7,TALBOT,And straightway give thy soul to him thou servest.
3797,Henry VI Part 1,2,1.5.8,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Come, come, 'tis only I that must disgrace thee."
3798,Henry VI Part 1,2,,JOAN LA PUCELLE,Here they fight
3799,Henry VI Part 1,3,1.5.9,TALBOT,"Heavens, can you suffer hell so to prevail?"
3800,Henry VI Part 1,3,1.5.10,TALBOT,My breast I'll burst with straining of my courage
3801,Henry VI Part 1,3,1.5.11,TALBOT,And from my shoulders crack my arms asunder.
3802,Henry VI Part 1,3,1.5.12,TALBOT,But I will chastise this high-minded strumpet.
3803,Henry VI Part 1,3,,TALBOT,They fight again
3804,Henry VI Part 1,4,1.5.13,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Talbot, farewell, thy hour is not yet come:"
3805,Henry VI Part 1,4,1.5.14,JOAN LA PUCELLE,I must go victual Orleans forthwith.
3806,Henry VI Part 1,4,1.5.14,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"A short alarum, then enter the town with soldiers"
3807,Henry VI Part 1,4,1.5.15,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"O'ertake me, if thou canst, I scorn thy strength."
3808,Henry VI Part 1,4,1.5.16,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Go, go, cheer up thy hungry-starved men,"
3809,Henry VI Part 1,4,1.5.17,JOAN LA PUCELLE,Help Salisbury to make his testament:
3810,Henry VI Part 1,4,1.5.18,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"This day is ours, as many more shall be."
3811,Henry VI Part 1,4,,JOAN LA PUCELLE,Exit
3812,Henry VI Part 1,5,1.5.19,TALBOT,"My thoughts are whirled like a potter's wheel,"
3813,Henry VI Part 1,5,1.5.20,TALBOT,"I know not where I am, nor what I do,"
3814,Henry VI Part 1,5,1.5.21,TALBOT,"A witch, by fear, not force, like Hannibal,"
3815,Henry VI Part 1,5,1.5.22,TALBOT,Drives back our troops and conquers as she lists:
3816,Henry VI Part 1,5,1.5.23,TALBOT,So bees with smoke and doves with noisome stench
3817,Henry VI Part 1,5,1.5.24,TALBOT,Are from their hives and houses driven away.
3818,Henry VI Part 1,5,1.5.25,TALBOT,"They call'd us for our fierceness English dogs,"
3819,Henry VI Part 1,5,1.5.26,TALBOT,"Now, like to whelps, we crying run away."
3820,Henry VI Part 1,5,,TALBOT,A short alarum
3821,Henry VI Part 1,5,1.5.27,TALBOT,"Hark, countrymen! either renew the fight,"
3822,Henry VI Part 1,5,1.5.28,TALBOT,"Or tear the lions out of England's coat,"
3823,Henry VI Part 1,5,1.5.29,TALBOT,"Renounce your soil, give sheep in lions' stead:"
3824,Henry VI Part 1,5,1.5.30,TALBOT,"Sheep run not half so treacherous from the wolf,"
3825,Henry VI Part 1,5,1.5.31,TALBOT,"Or horse or oxen from the leopard,"
3826,Henry VI Part 1,5,1.5.32,TALBOT,As you fly from your oft-subdued slaves.
3827,Henry VI Part 1,5,,TALBOT,Alarum. Here another skirmish
3828,Henry VI Part 1,5,1.5.33,TALBOT,It will not be: retire into your trenches:
3829,Henry VI Part 1,5,1.5.34,TALBOT,"You all consented unto Salisbury's death,"
3830,Henry VI Part 1,5,1.5.35,TALBOT,For none would strike a stroke in his revenge.
3831,Henry VI Part 1,5,1.5.36,TALBOT,"Pucelle is enter'd into Orleans,"
3832,Henry VI Part 1,5,1.5.37,TALBOT,In spite of us or aught that we could do.
3833,Henry VI Part 1,5,1.5.38,TALBOT,"O, would I were to die with Salisbury!"
3834,Henry VI Part 1,5,1.5.39,TALBOT,The shame hereof will make me hide my head.
3835,Henry VI Part 1,5,1.5.39,TALBOT,"Exit TALBOT. Alarum, retreat, flourish"
3836,Henry VI Part 1,5,1.5.39,TALBOT,SCENE VI. The same.
3837,Henry VI Part 1,5,,TALBOT,"Enter, on the walls, JOAN LA PUCELLE, CHARLES, REIGNIER, ALENCON, and Soldiers"
3838,Henry VI Part 1,1,1.6.1,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Advance our waving colours on the walls,"
3839,Henry VI Part 1,1,1.6.2,JOAN LA PUCELLE,Rescued is Orleans from the English
3840,Henry VI Part 1,1,1.6.3,JOAN LA PUCELLE,Thus Joan la Pucelle hath perform'd her word.
3841,Henry VI Part 1,2,1.6.4,CHARLES,"Divinest creature, Astraea's daughter,"
3842,Henry VI Part 1,2,1.6.5,CHARLES,How shall I honour thee for this success?
3843,Henry VI Part 1,2,1.6.6,CHARLES,Thy promises are like Adonis' gardens
3844,Henry VI Part 1,2,1.6.7,CHARLES,That one day bloom'd and fruitful were the next.
3845,Henry VI Part 1,2,1.6.8,CHARLES,"France, triumph in thy glorious prophetess!"
3846,Henry VI Part 1,2,1.6.9,CHARLES,Recover'd is the town of Orleans:
3847,Henry VI Part 1,2,1.6.10,CHARLES,More blessed hap did ne'er befall our state.
3848,Henry VI Part 1,3,1.6.11,REIGNIER,Why ring not out the bells aloud throughout the town?
3849,Henry VI Part 1,3,1.6.12,REIGNIER,"Dauphin, command the citizens make bonfires"
3850,Henry VI Part 1,3,1.6.13,REIGNIER,"And feast and banquet in the open streets,"
3851,Henry VI Part 1,3,1.6.14,REIGNIER,To celebrate the joy that God hath given us.
3852,Henry VI Part 1,4,1.6.15,ALENCON,"All France will be replete with mirth and joy,"
3853,Henry VI Part 1,4,1.6.16,ALENCON,When they shall hear how we have play'd the men.
3854,Henry VI Part 1,5,1.6.17,CHARLES,"'Tis Joan, not we, by whom the day is won,"
3855,Henry VI Part 1,5,1.6.18,CHARLES,"For which I will divide my crown with her,"
3856,Henry VI Part 1,5,1.6.19,CHARLES,And all the priests and friars in my realm
3857,Henry VI Part 1,5,1.6.20,CHARLES,Shall in procession sing her endless praise.
3858,Henry VI Part 1,5,1.6.21,CHARLES,A statelier pyramis to her I'll rear
3859,Henry VI Part 1,5,1.6.22,CHARLES,Than Rhodope's or Memphis' ever was:
3860,Henry VI Part 1,5,1.6.23,CHARLES,"In memory of her when she is dead,"
3861,Henry VI Part 1,5,1.6.24,CHARLES,"Her ashes, in an urn more precious"
3862,Henry VI Part 1,5,1.6.25,CHARLES,"Than the rich-jewel'd of Darius,"
3863,Henry VI Part 1,5,1.6.26,CHARLES,Transported shall be at high festivals
3864,Henry VI Part 1,5,1.6.27,CHARLES,Before the kings and queens of France.
3865,Henry VI Part 1,5,1.6.28,CHARLES,"No longer on Saint Denis will we cry,"
3866,Henry VI Part 1,5,1.6.29,CHARLES,But Joan la Pucelle shall be France's saint.
3867,Henry VI Part 1,5,1.6.30,CHARLES,"Come in, and let us banquet royally,"
3868,Henry VI Part 1,5,1.6.31,CHARLES,After this golden day of victory.
3869,Henry VI Part 1,5,,CHARLES,Flourish. Exeunt
3870,Henry VI Part 1,5,,CHARLES,ACT II
3871,Henry VI Part 1,5,,CHARLES,SCENE I. Before Orleans.
3872,Henry VI Part 1,5,,CHARLES,Enter a Sergeant of a band with two Sentinels
3873,Henry VI Part 1,1,2.1.1,Sergeant,"Sirs, take your places and be vigilant:"
3874,Henry VI Part 1,1,2.1.2,Sergeant,If any noise or soldier you perceive
3875,Henry VI Part 1,1,2.1.3,Sergeant,"Near to the walls, by some apparent sign"
3876,Henry VI Part 1,1,2.1.4,Sergeant,Let us have knowledge at the court of guard.
3877,Henry VI Part 1,2,2.1.5,First Sentinel,"Sergeant, you shall."
3878,Henry VI Part 1,2,,First Sentinel,Exit Sergeant
3879,Henry VI Part 1,2,2.1.6,First Sentinel,"Thus are poor servitors,"
3880,Henry VI Part 1,2,2.1.7,First Sentinel,"When others sleep upon their quiet beds,"
3881,Henry VI Part 1,2,2.1.8,First Sentinel,"Constrain'd to watch in darkness, rain and cold."
3882,Henry VI Part 1,2,,First Sentinel,"Enter TALBOT, BEDFORD, BURGUNDY, and Forces, with scaling-ladders, their drums beating a dead march"
3883,Henry VI Part 1,3,2.1.9,TALBOT,"Lord Regent, and redoubted Burgundy,"
3884,Henry VI Part 1,3,2.1.10,TALBOT,"By whose approach the regions of Artois,"
3885,Henry VI Part 1,3,2.1.11,TALBOT,"Wallon and Picardy are friends to us,"
3886,Henry VI Part 1,3,2.1.12,TALBOT,"This happy night the Frenchmen are secure,"
3887,Henry VI Part 1,3,2.1.13,TALBOT,Having all day caroused and banqueted:
3888,Henry VI Part 1,3,2.1.14,TALBOT,Embrace we then this opportunity
3889,Henry VI Part 1,3,2.1.15,TALBOT,As fitting best to quittance their deceit
3890,Henry VI Part 1,3,2.1.16,TALBOT,Contrived by art and baleful sorcery.
3891,Henry VI Part 1,4,2.1.17,BEDFORD,"Coward of France! how much he wrongs his fame,"
3892,Henry VI Part 1,4,2.1.18,BEDFORD,"Despairing of his own arm's fortitude,"
3893,Henry VI Part 1,4,2.1.19,BEDFORD,To join with witches and the help of hell!
3894,Henry VI Part 1,5,2.1.20,BURGUNDY,Traitors have never other company.
3895,Henry VI Part 1,5,2.1.21,BURGUNDY,But what's that Pucelle whom they term so pure?
3896,Henry VI Part 1,6,2.1.22,TALBOT,"A maid, they say."
3897,Henry VI Part 1,7,2.1.23,BEDFORD,A maid! and be so martial!
3898,Henry VI Part 1,8,2.1.24,BURGUNDY,"Pray God she prove not masculine ere long,"
3899,Henry VI Part 1,8,2.1.25,BURGUNDY,If underneath the standard of the French
3900,Henry VI Part 1,8,2.1.26,BURGUNDY,She carry armour as she hath begun.
3901,Henry VI Part 1,9,2.1.27,TALBOT,"Well, let them practise and converse with spirits:"
3902,Henry VI Part 1,9,2.1.28,TALBOT,"God is our fortress, in whose conquering name"
3903,Henry VI Part 1,9,2.1.29,TALBOT,Let us resolve to scale their flinty bulwarks.
3904,Henry VI Part 1,10,2.1.30,BEDFORD,"Ascend, brave Talbot, we will follow thee."
3905,Henry VI Part 1,11,2.1.31,TALBOT,"Not all together: better far, I guess,"
3906,Henry VI Part 1,11,2.1.32,TALBOT,"That we do make our entrance several ways,"
3907,Henry VI Part 1,11,2.1.33,TALBOT,"That, if it chance the one of us do fail,"
3908,Henry VI Part 1,11,2.1.34,TALBOT,The other yet may rise against their force.
3909,Henry VI Part 1,12,2.1.35,BEDFORD,Agreed: I'll to yond corner.
3910,Henry VI Part 1,13,2.1.36,BURGUNDY,And I to this.
3911,Henry VI Part 1,14,2.1.37,TALBOT,"And here will Talbot mount, or make his grave."
3912,Henry VI Part 1,14,2.1.38,TALBOT,"Now, Salisbury, for thee, and for the right"
3913,Henry VI Part 1,14,2.1.39,TALBOT,"Of English Henry, shall this night appear"
3914,Henry VI Part 1,14,2.1.40,TALBOT,How much in duty I am bound to both.
3915,Henry VI Part 1,15,2.1.41,Sentinels,Arm! arm! the enemy doth make assault!
3916,Henry VI Part 1,15,2.1.41,Sentinels,"Cry: 'St. George,' 'A Talbot.'"
3917,Henry VI Part 1,15,,Sentinels,"The French leap over the walls in their shirts.  Enter, several ways, the BASTARD OF ORLEANS, ALENCON, and REIGNIER, half ready, and half unready"
3918,Henry VI Part 1,16,2.1.42,ALENCON,"How now, my lords! what, all unready so?"
3919,Henry VI Part 1,17,2.1.43,BASTARD OF ORLEANS,"Unready! ay, and glad we 'scaped so well."
3920,Henry VI Part 1,18,2.1.44,REIGNIER,"'Twas time, I trow, to wake and leave our beds,"
3921,Henry VI Part 1,18,2.1.45,REIGNIER,Hearing alarums at our chamber-doors.
3922,Henry VI Part 1,19,2.1.46,ALENCON,"Of all exploits since first I follow'd arms,"
3923,Henry VI Part 1,19,2.1.47,ALENCON,Ne'er heard I of a warlike enterprise
3924,Henry VI Part 1,19,2.1.48,ALENCON,More venturous or desperate than this.
3925,Henry VI Part 1,20,2.1.49,BASTARD OF ORLEANS,I think this Talbot be a fiend of hell.
3926,Henry VI Part 1,21,2.1.50,REIGNIER,"If not of hell, the heavens, sure, favour him."
3927,Henry VI Part 1,22,2.1.51,ALENCON,Here cometh Charles: I marvel how he sped.
3928,Henry VI Part 1,23,2.1.52,BASTARD OF ORLEANS,"Tut, holy Joan was his defensive guard."
3929,Henry VI Part 1,23,,BASTARD OF ORLEANS,Enter CHARLES and JOAN LA PUCELLE
3930,Henry VI Part 1,24,2.1.53,CHARLES,"Is this thy cunning, thou deceitful dame?"
3931,Henry VI Part 1,24,2.1.54,CHARLES,"Didst thou at first, to flatter us withal,"
3932,Henry VI Part 1,24,2.1.55,CHARLES,"Make us partakers of a little gain,"
3933,Henry VI Part 1,24,2.1.56,CHARLES,That now our loss might be ten times so much?
3934,Henry VI Part 1,25,2.1.57,JOAN LA PUCELLE,Wherefore is Charles impatient with his friend!
3935,Henry VI Part 1,25,2.1.58,JOAN LA PUCELLE,At all times will you have my power alike?
3936,Henry VI Part 1,25,2.1.59,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Sleeping or waking must I still prevail,"
3937,Henry VI Part 1,25,2.1.60,JOAN LA PUCELLE,Or will you blame and lay the fault on me?
3938,Henry VI Part 1,25,2.1.61,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Improvident soldiers! had your watch been good,"
3939,Henry VI Part 1,25,2.1.62,JOAN LA PUCELLE,This sudden mischief never could have fall'n.
3940,Henry VI Part 1,26,2.1.63,CHARLES,"Duke of Alencon, this was your default,"
3941,Henry VI Part 1,26,2.1.64,CHARLES,"That, being captain of the watch to-night,"
3942,Henry VI Part 1,26,2.1.65,CHARLES,Did look no better to that weighty charge.
3943,Henry VI Part 1,27,2.1.66,ALENCON,Had all your quarters been as safely kept
3944,Henry VI Part 1,27,2.1.67,ALENCON,"As that whereof I had the government,"
3945,Henry VI Part 1,27,2.1.68,ALENCON,We had not been thus shamefully surprised.
3946,Henry VI Part 1,28,2.1.69,BASTARD OF ORLEANS,Mine was secure.
3947,Henry VI Part 1,29,2.1.70,REIGNIER,"And so was mine, my lord."
3948,Henry VI Part 1,30,2.1.71,CHARLES,"And, for myself, most part of all this night,"
3949,Henry VI Part 1,30,2.1.72,CHARLES,Within her quarter and mine own precinct
3950,Henry VI Part 1,30,2.1.73,CHARLES,"I was employ'd in passing to and fro,"
3951,Henry VI Part 1,30,2.1.74,CHARLES,About relieving of the sentinels:
3952,Henry VI Part 1,30,2.1.75,CHARLES,Then how or which way should they first break in?
3953,Henry VI Part 1,31,2.1.76,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Question, my lords, no further of the case,"
3954,Henry VI Part 1,31,2.1.77,JOAN LA PUCELLE,How or which way: 'tis sure they found some place
3955,Henry VI Part 1,31,2.1.78,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"But weakly guarded, where the breach was made."
3956,Henry VI Part 1,31,2.1.79,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"And now there rests no other shift but this,"
3957,Henry VI Part 1,31,2.1.80,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"To gather our soldiers, scatter'd and dispersed,"
3958,Henry VI Part 1,31,2.1.81,JOAN LA PUCELLE,And lay new platforms to endamage them.
3959,Henry VI Part 1,31,2.1.81,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Alarum. Enter an English Soldier, crying 'A  Talbot! a Talbot!' They fly, leaving their clothes behind"
3960,Henry VI Part 1,32,2.1.82,Soldier,I'll be so bold to take what they have left.
3961,Henry VI Part 1,32,2.1.83,Soldier,"The cry of Talbot serves me for a sword,"
3962,Henry VI Part 1,32,2.1.84,Soldier,"For I have loaden me with many spoils,"
3963,Henry VI Part 1,32,2.1.85,Soldier,Using no other weapon but his name.
3964,Henry VI Part 1,32,,Soldier,Exit
3965,Henry VI Part 1,32,,Soldier,SCENE II. Orleans. Within the town.
3966,Henry VI Part 1,32,,Soldier,"Enter TALBOT, BEDFORD, BURGUNDY, a Captain, and others"
3967,Henry VI Part 1,1,2.2.1,BEDFORD,"The day begins to break, and night is fled,"
3968,Henry VI Part 1,1,2.2.2,BEDFORD,Whose pitchy mantle over-veil'd the earth.
3969,Henry VI Part 1,1,2.2.3,BEDFORD,"Here sound retreat, and cease our hot pursuit."
3970,Henry VI Part 1,1,,BEDFORD,Retreat sounded
3971,Henry VI Part 1,2,2.2.4,TALBOT,"Bring forth the body of old Salisbury,"
3972,Henry VI Part 1,2,2.2.5,TALBOT,"And here advance it in the market-place,"
3973,Henry VI Part 1,2,2.2.6,TALBOT,The middle centre of this cursed town.
3974,Henry VI Part 1,2,2.2.7,TALBOT,"Now have I paid my vow unto his soul,"
3975,Henry VI Part 1,2,2.2.8,TALBOT,"For every drop of blood was drawn from him,"
3976,Henry VI Part 1,2,2.2.9,TALBOT,There hath at least five Frenchmen died tonight.
3977,Henry VI Part 1,2,2.2.10,TALBOT,And that hereafter ages may behold
3978,Henry VI Part 1,2,2.2.11,TALBOT,"What ruin happen'd in revenge of him,"
3979,Henry VI Part 1,2,2.2.12,TALBOT,Within their chiefest temple I'll erect
3980,Henry VI Part 1,2,2.2.13,TALBOT,"A tomb, wherein his corpse shall be interr'd:"
3981,Henry VI Part 1,2,2.2.14,TALBOT,"Upon the which, that every one may read,"
3982,Henry VI Part 1,2,2.2.15,TALBOT,"Shall be engraved the sack of Orleans,"
3983,Henry VI Part 1,2,2.2.16,TALBOT,The treacherous manner of his mournful death
3984,Henry VI Part 1,2,2.2.17,TALBOT,And what a terror he had been to France.
3985,Henry VI Part 1,2,2.2.18,TALBOT,"But, lords, in all our bloody massacre,"
3986,Henry VI Part 1,2,2.2.19,TALBOT,"I muse we met not with the Dauphin's grace,"
3987,Henry VI Part 1,2,2.2.20,TALBOT,"His new-come champion, virtuous Joan of Arc,"
3988,Henry VI Part 1,2,2.2.21,TALBOT,Nor any of his false confederates.
3989,Henry VI Part 1,3,2.2.22,BEDFORD,"'Tis thought, Lord Talbot, when the fight began,"
3990,Henry VI Part 1,3,2.2.23,BEDFORD,"Roused on the sudden from their drowsy beds,"
3991,Henry VI Part 1,3,2.2.24,BEDFORD,They did amongst the troops of armed men
3992,Henry VI Part 1,3,2.2.25,BEDFORD,Leap o'er the walls for refuge in the field.
3993,Henry VI Part 1,4,2.2.26,BURGUNDY,"Myself, as far as I could well discern"
3994,Henry VI Part 1,4,2.2.27,BURGUNDY,"For smoke and dusky vapours of the night,"
3995,Henry VI Part 1,4,2.2.28,BURGUNDY,"Am sure I scared the Dauphin and his trull,"
3996,Henry VI Part 1,4,2.2.29,BURGUNDY,"When arm in arm they both came swiftly running,"
3997,Henry VI Part 1,4,2.2.30,BURGUNDY,Like to a pair of loving turtle-doves
3998,Henry VI Part 1,4,2.2.31,BURGUNDY,That could not live asunder day or night.
3999,Henry VI Part 1,4,2.2.32,BURGUNDY,"After that things are set in order here,"
4000,Henry VI Part 1,4,2.2.33,BURGUNDY,We'll follow them with all the power we have.
4001,Henry VI Part 1,4,,BURGUNDY,Enter a Messenger
4002,Henry VI Part 1,5,2.2.34,Messenger,"All hail, my lords! which of this princely train"
4003,Henry VI Part 1,5,2.2.35,Messenger,"Call ye the warlike Talbot, for his acts"
4004,Henry VI Part 1,5,2.2.36,Messenger,So much applauded through the realm of France?
4005,Henry VI Part 1,6,2.2.37,TALBOT,Here is the Talbot: who would speak with him?
4006,Henry VI Part 1,7,2.2.38,Messenger,"The virtuous lady, Countess of Auvergne,"
4007,Henry VI Part 1,7,2.2.39,Messenger,"With modesty admiring thy renown,"
4008,Henry VI Part 1,7,2.2.40,Messenger,"By me entreats, great lord, thou wouldst vouchsafe"
4009,Henry VI Part 1,7,2.2.41,Messenger,"To visit her poor castle where she lies,"
4010,Henry VI Part 1,7,2.2.42,Messenger,That she may boast she hath beheld the man
4011,Henry VI Part 1,7,2.2.43,Messenger,Whose glory fills the world with loud report.
4012,Henry VI Part 1,8,2.2.44,BURGUNDY,"Is it even so? Nay, then, I see our wars"
4013,Henry VI Part 1,8,2.2.45,BURGUNDY,"Will turn unto a peaceful comic sport,"
4014,Henry VI Part 1,8,2.2.46,BURGUNDY,When ladies crave to be encounter'd with.
4015,Henry VI Part 1,8,2.2.47,BURGUNDY,"You may not, my lord, despise her gentle suit."
4016,Henry VI Part 1,9,2.2.48,TALBOT,"Ne'er trust me then, for when a world of men"
4017,Henry VI Part 1,9,2.2.49,TALBOT,"Could not prevail with all their oratory,"
4018,Henry VI Part 1,9,2.2.50,TALBOT,Yet hath a woman's kindness over-ruled:
4019,Henry VI Part 1,9,2.2.51,TALBOT,"And therefore tell her I return great thanks,"
4020,Henry VI Part 1,9,2.2.52,TALBOT,And in submission will attend on her.
4021,Henry VI Part 1,9,2.2.53,TALBOT,Will not your honours bear me company?
4022,Henry VI Part 1,10,2.2.54,BEDFORD,"No, truly, it is more than manners will:"
4023,Henry VI Part 1,10,2.2.55,BEDFORD,"And I have heard it said, unbidden guests"
4024,Henry VI Part 1,10,2.2.56,BEDFORD,Are often welcomest when they are gone.
4025,Henry VI Part 1,11,2.2.57,TALBOT,"Well then, alone, since there's no remedy,"
4026,Henry VI Part 1,11,2.2.58,TALBOT,I mean to prove this lady's courtesy.
4027,Henry VI Part 1,11,2.2.59,TALBOT,"Come hither, captain."
4028,Henry VI Part 1,11,,TALBOT,Whispers
4029,Henry VI Part 1,11,2.2.60,TALBOT,You perceive my mind?
4030,Henry VI Part 1,12,2.2.61,Captain,"I do, my lord, and mean accordingly."
4031,Henry VI Part 1,12,,Captain,Exeunt
4032,Henry VI Part 1,12,,Captain,SCENE III. Auvergne. The COUNTESS's castle.
4033,Henry VI Part 1,12,,Captain,Enter the COUNTESS and her Porter
4034,Henry VI Part 1,12,2.3.1,Captain,COUNTESS
4035,Henry VI Part 1,1,2.3.2,OF AUVERGNE,"Porter, remember what I gave in charge,"
4036,Henry VI Part 1,1,2.3.3,OF AUVERGNE,"And when you have done so, bring the keys to me."
4037,Henry VI Part 1,2,2.3.4,Porter,"Madam, I will."
4038,Henry VI Part 1,2,,Porter,Exit
4039,Henry VI Part 1,2,2.3.5,Porter,COUNTESS
4040,Henry VI Part 1,3,2.3.6,OF AUVERGNE,"The plot is laid: if all things fall out right,"
4041,Henry VI Part 1,3,2.3.7,OF AUVERGNE,I shall as famous be by this exploit
4042,Henry VI Part 1,3,2.3.8,OF AUVERGNE,As Scythian Tomyris by Cyrus' death.
4043,Henry VI Part 1,3,2.3.9,OF AUVERGNE,"Great is the rumor of this dreadful knight,"
4044,Henry VI Part 1,3,2.3.10,OF AUVERGNE,And his achievements of no less account:
4045,Henry VI Part 1,3,2.3.11,OF AUVERGNE,"Fain would mine eyes be witness with mine ears,"
4046,Henry VI Part 1,3,2.3.12,OF AUVERGNE,To give their censure of these rare reports.
4047,Henry VI Part 1,3,,OF AUVERGNE,Enter Messenger and TALBOT
4048,Henry VI Part 1,4,2.3.13,Messenger,"Madam,"
4049,Henry VI Part 1,4,2.3.14,Messenger,"According as your ladyship desired,"
4050,Henry VI Part 1,4,2.3.15,Messenger,"By message craved, so is Lord Talbot come."
4051,Henry VI Part 1,4,2.3.16,Messenger,COUNTESS
4052,Henry VI Part 1,5,2.3.17,OF AUVERGNE,And he is welcome. What! is this the man?
4053,Henry VI Part 1,6,2.3.18,Messenger,"Madam, it is."
4054,Henry VI Part 1,6,2.3.19,Messenger,COUNTESS
4055,Henry VI Part 1,7,2.3.20,OF AUVERGNE,Is this the scourge of France?
4056,Henry VI Part 1,7,2.3.21,OF AUVERGNE,"Is this the Talbot, so much fear'd abroad"
4057,Henry VI Part 1,7,2.3.22,OF AUVERGNE,That with his name the mothers still their babes?
4058,Henry VI Part 1,7,2.3.23,OF AUVERGNE,I see report is fabulous and false:
4059,Henry VI Part 1,7,2.3.24,OF AUVERGNE,"I thought I should have seen some Hercules,"
4060,Henry VI Part 1,7,2.3.25,OF AUVERGNE,"A second Hector, for his grim aspect,"
4061,Henry VI Part 1,7,2.3.26,OF AUVERGNE,And large proportion of his strong-knit limbs.
4062,Henry VI Part 1,7,2.3.27,OF AUVERGNE,"Alas, this is a child, a silly dwarf!"
4063,Henry VI Part 1,7,2.3.28,OF AUVERGNE,It cannot be this weak and writhled shrimp
4064,Henry VI Part 1,7,2.3.29,OF AUVERGNE,Should strike such terror to his enemies.
4065,Henry VI Part 1,8,2.3.30,TALBOT,"Madam, I have been bold to trouble you,"
4066,Henry VI Part 1,8,2.3.31,TALBOT,"But since your ladyship is not at leisure,"
4067,Henry VI Part 1,8,2.3.32,TALBOT,I'll sort some other time to visit you.
4068,Henry VI Part 1,8,2.3.33,TALBOT,COUNTESS
4069,Henry VI Part 1,9,2.3.34,OF AUVERGNE,What means he now? Go ask him whither he goes.
4070,Henry VI Part 1,10,2.3.35,Messenger,"Stay, my Lord Talbot, for my lady craves"
4071,Henry VI Part 1,10,2.3.36,Messenger,To know the cause of your abrupt departure.
4072,Henry VI Part 1,11,2.3.37,TALBOT,"Marry, for that she's in a wrong belief,"
4073,Henry VI Part 1,11,2.3.38,TALBOT,I go to certify her Talbot's here.
4074,Henry VI Part 1,11,,TALBOT,Re-enter Porter with keys
4075,Henry VI Part 1,11,2.3.39,TALBOT,COUNTESS
4076,Henry VI Part 1,12,2.3.40,OF AUVERGNE,"If thou be he, then art thou prisoner."
4077,Henry VI Part 1,13,2.3.41,TALBOT,Prisoner! to whom?
4078,Henry VI Part 1,13,2.3.42,TALBOT,COUNTESS
4079,Henry VI Part 1,14,2.3.43,OF AUVERGNE,"To me, blood-thirsty lord,"
4080,Henry VI Part 1,14,2.3.44,OF AUVERGNE,And for that cause I trained thee to my house.
4081,Henry VI Part 1,14,2.3.45,OF AUVERGNE,"Long time thy shadow hath been thrall to me,"
4082,Henry VI Part 1,14,2.3.46,OF AUVERGNE,For in my gallery thy picture hangs:
4083,Henry VI Part 1,14,2.3.47,OF AUVERGNE,"But now the substance shall endure the like,"
4084,Henry VI Part 1,14,2.3.48,OF AUVERGNE,"And I will chain these legs and arms of thine,"
4085,Henry VI Part 1,14,2.3.49,OF AUVERGNE,That hast by tyranny these many years
4086,Henry VI Part 1,14,2.3.50,OF AUVERGNE,"Wasted our country, slain our citizens"
4087,Henry VI Part 1,14,2.3.51,OF AUVERGNE,And sent our sons and husbands captivate.
4088,Henry VI Part 1,15,2.3.52,TALBOT,"Ha, ha, ha!"
4089,Henry VI Part 1,15,2.3.53,TALBOT,COUNTESS
4090,Henry VI Part 1,16,2.3.54,OF AUVERGNE,"Laughest thou, wretch? thy mirth shall turn to moan."
4091,Henry VI Part 1,17,2.3.55,TALBOT,I laugh to see your ladyship so fond
4092,Henry VI Part 1,17,2.3.56,TALBOT,To think that you have aught but Talbot's shadow
4093,Henry VI Part 1,17,2.3.57,TALBOT,Whereon to practise your severity.
4094,Henry VI Part 1,17,2.3.58,TALBOT,COUNTESS
4095,Henry VI Part 1,18,2.3.59,OF AUVERGNE,"Why, art not thou the man?"
4096,Henry VI Part 1,19,2.3.60,TALBOT,I am indeed.
4097,Henry VI Part 1,19,2.3.61,TALBOT,COUNTESS
4098,Henry VI Part 1,20,2.3.62,OF AUVERGNE,Then have I substance too.
4099,Henry VI Part 1,21,2.3.63,TALBOT,"No, no, I am but shadow of myself:"
4100,Henry VI Part 1,21,2.3.64,TALBOT,"You are deceived, my substance is not here,"
4101,Henry VI Part 1,21,2.3.65,TALBOT,For what you see is but the smallest part
4102,Henry VI Part 1,21,2.3.66,TALBOT,And least proportion of humanity:
4103,Henry VI Part 1,21,2.3.67,TALBOT,"I tell you, madam, were the whole frame here,"
4104,Henry VI Part 1,21,2.3.68,TALBOT,"It is of such a spacious lofty pitch,"
4105,Henry VI Part 1,21,2.3.69,TALBOT,Your roof were not sufficient to contain't.
4106,Henry VI Part 1,21,2.3.70,TALBOT,COUNTESS
4107,Henry VI Part 1,22,2.3.71,OF AUVERGNE,"This is a riddling merchant for the nonce,"
4108,Henry VI Part 1,22,2.3.72,OF AUVERGNE,"He will be here, and yet he is not here:"
4109,Henry VI Part 1,22,2.3.73,OF AUVERGNE,How can these contrarieties agree?
4110,Henry VI Part 1,23,2.3.74,TALBOT,That will I show you presently.
4111,Henry VI Part 1,23,2.3.74,TALBOT,Winds his horn. Drums strike up: a peal of ordnance. Enter soldiers
4112,Henry VI Part 1,23,2.3.75,TALBOT,"How say you, madam? are you now persuaded"
4113,Henry VI Part 1,23,2.3.76,TALBOT,That Talbot is but shadow of himself?
4114,Henry VI Part 1,23,2.3.77,TALBOT,"These are his substance, sinews, arms and strength,"
4115,Henry VI Part 1,23,2.3.78,TALBOT,"With which he yoketh your rebellious necks,"
4116,Henry VI Part 1,23,2.3.79,TALBOT,Razeth your cities and subverts your towns
4117,Henry VI Part 1,23,2.3.80,TALBOT,And in a moment makes them desolate.
4118,Henry VI Part 1,23,2.3.81,TALBOT,COUNTESS
4119,Henry VI Part 1,24,2.3.82,OF AUVERGNE,Victorious Talbot! pardon my abuse:
4120,Henry VI Part 1,24,2.3.83,OF AUVERGNE,I find thou art no less than fame hath bruited
4121,Henry VI Part 1,24,2.3.84,OF AUVERGNE,And more than may be gather'd by thy shape.
4122,Henry VI Part 1,24,2.3.85,OF AUVERGNE,"Let my presumption not provoke thy wrath,"
4123,Henry VI Part 1,24,2.3.86,OF AUVERGNE,For I am sorry that with reverence
4124,Henry VI Part 1,24,2.3.87,OF AUVERGNE,I did not entertain thee as thou art.
4125,Henry VI Part 1,25,2.3.88,TALBOT,"Be not dismay'd, fair lady, nor misconstrue"
4126,Henry VI Part 1,25,2.3.89,TALBOT,"The mind of Talbot, as you did mistake"
4127,Henry VI Part 1,25,2.3.90,TALBOT,The outward composition of his body.
4128,Henry VI Part 1,25,2.3.91,TALBOT,"What you have done hath not offended me,"
4129,Henry VI Part 1,25,2.3.92,TALBOT,"Nor other satisfaction do I crave,"
4130,Henry VI Part 1,25,2.3.93,TALBOT,"But only, with your patience, that we may"
4131,Henry VI Part 1,25,2.3.94,TALBOT,"Taste of your wine and see what cates you have,"
4132,Henry VI Part 1,25,2.3.95,TALBOT,For soldiers' stomachs always serve them well.
4133,Henry VI Part 1,25,2.3.96,TALBOT,COUNTESS
4134,Henry VI Part 1,26,2.3.97,OF AUVERGNE,"With all my heart, and think me honoured"
4135,Henry VI Part 1,26,2.3.98,OF AUVERGNE,To feast so great a warrior in my house.
4136,Henry VI Part 1,26,,OF AUVERGNE,Exeunt
4137,Henry VI Part 1,26,,OF AUVERGNE,SCENE IV. London. The Temple-garden.
4138,Henry VI Part 1,26,,OF AUVERGNE,"Enter the Earls of SOMERSET, SUFFOLK, and WARWICK, RICHARD PLANTAGENET, VERNON, and another Lawyer"
4139,Henry VI Part 1,26,2.4.1,OF AUVERGNE,RICHARD
4140,Henry VI Part 1,1,2.4.2,PLANTAGENET,"Great lords and gentlemen, what means this silence?"
4141,Henry VI Part 1,1,2.4.3,PLANTAGENET,Dare no man answer in a case of truth?
4142,Henry VI Part 1,2,2.4.4,SUFFOLK,"Within the Temple-hall we were too loud,"
4143,Henry VI Part 1,2,2.4.5,SUFFOLK,The garden here is more convenient.
4144,Henry VI Part 1,2,2.4.6,SUFFOLK,RICHARD
4145,Henry VI Part 1,3,2.4.7,PLANTAGENET,"Then say at once if I maintain'd the truth,"
4146,Henry VI Part 1,3,2.4.8,PLANTAGENET,Or else was wrangling Somerset in the error?
4147,Henry VI Part 1,4,2.4.9,SUFFOLK,"Faith, I have been a truant in the law,"
4148,Henry VI Part 1,4,2.4.10,SUFFOLK,"And never yet could frame my will to it,"
4149,Henry VI Part 1,4,2.4.11,SUFFOLK,And therefore frame the law unto my will.
4150,Henry VI Part 1,5,2.4.12,SOMERSET,"Judge you, my Lord of Warwick, then, between us."
4151,Henry VI Part 1,6,2.4.13,WARWICK,"Between two hawks, which flies the higher pitch,"
4152,Henry VI Part 1,6,2.4.14,WARWICK,"Between two dogs, which hath the deeper mouth,"
4153,Henry VI Part 1,6,2.4.15,WARWICK,"Between two blades, which bears the better temper:"
4154,Henry VI Part 1,6,2.4.16,WARWICK,"Between two horses, which doth bear him best,"
4155,Henry VI Part 1,6,2.4.17,WARWICK,"Between two girls, which hath the merriest eye,"
4156,Henry VI Part 1,6,2.4.18,WARWICK,"I have perhaps some shallow spirit of judgement,"
4157,Henry VI Part 1,6,2.4.19,WARWICK,"But in these nice sharp quillets of the law,"
4158,Henry VI Part 1,6,2.4.20,WARWICK,"Good faith, I am no wiser than a daw."
4159,Henry VI Part 1,6,2.4.21,WARWICK,RICHARD
4160,Henry VI Part 1,7,2.4.22,PLANTAGENET,"Tut, tut, here is a mannerly forbearance:"
4161,Henry VI Part 1,7,2.4.23,PLANTAGENET,The truth appears so naked on my side
4162,Henry VI Part 1,7,2.4.24,PLANTAGENET,That any purblind eye may find it out.
4163,Henry VI Part 1,8,2.4.25,SOMERSET,"And on my side it is so well apparell'd,"
4164,Henry VI Part 1,8,2.4.26,SOMERSET,"So clear, so shining and so evident"
4165,Henry VI Part 1,8,2.4.27,SOMERSET,That it will glimmer through a blind man's eye.
4166,Henry VI Part 1,8,2.4.28,SOMERSET,RICHARD
4167,Henry VI Part 1,9,2.4.29,PLANTAGENET,"Since you are tongue-tied and so loath to speak,"
4168,Henry VI Part 1,9,2.4.30,PLANTAGENET,In dumb significants proclaim your thoughts:
4169,Henry VI Part 1,9,2.4.31,PLANTAGENET,Let him that is a true-born gentleman
4170,Henry VI Part 1,9,2.4.32,PLANTAGENET,"And stands upon the honour of his birth,"
4171,Henry VI Part 1,9,2.4.33,PLANTAGENET,"If he suppose that I have pleaded truth,"
4172,Henry VI Part 1,9,2.4.34,PLANTAGENET,From off this brier pluck a white rose with me.
4173,Henry VI Part 1,10,2.4.35,SOMERSET,"Let him that is no coward nor no flatterer,"
4174,Henry VI Part 1,10,2.4.36,SOMERSET,"But dare maintain the party of the truth,"
4175,Henry VI Part 1,10,2.4.37,SOMERSET,Pluck a red rose from off this thorn with me.
4176,Henry VI Part 1,11,2.4.38,WARWICK,"I love no colours, and without all colour"
4177,Henry VI Part 1,11,2.4.39,WARWICK,Of base insinuating flattery
4178,Henry VI Part 1,11,2.4.40,WARWICK,I pluck this white rose with Plantagenet.
4179,Henry VI Part 1,12,2.4.41,SUFFOLK,I pluck this red rose with young Somerset
4180,Henry VI Part 1,12,2.4.42,SUFFOLK,And say withal I think he held the right.
4181,Henry VI Part 1,13,2.4.43,VERNON,"Stay, lords and gentlemen, and pluck no more,"
4182,Henry VI Part 1,13,2.4.44,VERNON,Till you conclude that he upon whose side
4183,Henry VI Part 1,13,2.4.45,VERNON,The fewest roses are cropp'd from the tree
4184,Henry VI Part 1,13,2.4.46,VERNON,Shall yield the other in the right opinion.
4185,Henry VI Part 1,14,2.4.47,SOMERSET,"Good Master Vernon, it is well objected:"
4186,Henry VI Part 1,14,2.4.48,SOMERSET,"If I have fewest, I subscribe in silence."
4187,Henry VI Part 1,14,2.4.49,SOMERSET,RICHARD
4188,Henry VI Part 1,15,2.4.50,PLANTAGENET,And I.
4189,Henry VI Part 1,16,2.4.51,VERNON,Then for the truth and plainness of the case.
4190,Henry VI Part 1,16,2.4.52,VERNON,"I pluck this pale and maiden blossom here,"
4191,Henry VI Part 1,16,2.4.53,VERNON,Giving my verdict on the white rose side.
4192,Henry VI Part 1,17,2.4.54,SOMERSET,"Prick not your finger as you pluck it off,"
4193,Henry VI Part 1,17,2.4.55,SOMERSET,Lest bleeding you do paint the white rose red
4194,Henry VI Part 1,17,2.4.56,SOMERSET,"And fall on my side so, against your will."
4195,Henry VI Part 1,18,2.4.57,VERNON,"If I my lord, for my opinion bleed,"
4196,Henry VI Part 1,18,2.4.58,VERNON,Opinion shall be surgeon to my hurt
4197,Henry VI Part 1,18,2.4.59,VERNON,And keep me on the side where still I am.
4198,Henry VI Part 1,19,2.4.60,SOMERSET,"Well, well, come on: who else?"
4199,Henry VI Part 1,20,2.4.61,Lawyer,"Unless my study and my books be false,"
4200,Henry VI Part 1,20,2.4.62,Lawyer,The argument you held was wrong in you:
4201,Henry VI Part 1,20,,Lawyer,To SOMERSET
4202,Henry VI Part 1,20,2.4.63,Lawyer,In sign whereof I pluck a white rose too.
4203,Henry VI Part 1,20,2.4.64,Lawyer,RICHARD
4204,Henry VI Part 1,21,2.4.65,PLANTAGENET,"Now, Somerset, where is your argument?"
4205,Henry VI Part 1,22,2.4.66,SOMERSET,"Here in my scabbard, meditating that"
4206,Henry VI Part 1,22,2.4.67,SOMERSET,Shall dye your white rose in a bloody red.
4207,Henry VI Part 1,22,2.4.68,SOMERSET,RICHARD
4208,Henry VI Part 1,23,2.4.69,PLANTAGENET,"Meantime your cheeks do counterfeit our roses,"
4209,Henry VI Part 1,23,2.4.70,PLANTAGENET,"For pale they look with fear, as witnessing"
4210,Henry VI Part 1,23,2.4.71,PLANTAGENET,The truth on our side.
4211,Henry VI Part 1,24,2.4.72,SOMERSET,"No, Plantagenet,"
4212,Henry VI Part 1,24,2.4.73,SOMERSET,'Tis not for fear but anger that thy cheeks
4213,Henry VI Part 1,24,2.4.74,SOMERSET,"Blush for pure shame to counterfeit our roses,"
4214,Henry VI Part 1,24,2.4.75,SOMERSET,And yet thy tongue will not confess thy error.
4215,Henry VI Part 1,24,2.4.76,SOMERSET,RICHARD
4216,Henry VI Part 1,25,2.4.77,PLANTAGENET,"Hath not thy rose a canker, Somerset?"
4217,Henry VI Part 1,26,2.4.78,SOMERSET,"Hath not thy rose a thorn, Plantagenet?"
4218,Henry VI Part 1,26,2.4.79,SOMERSET,RICHARD
4219,Henry VI Part 1,27,2.4.80,PLANTAGENET,"Ay, sharp and piercing, to maintain his truth,"
4220,Henry VI Part 1,27,2.4.81,PLANTAGENET,Whiles thy consuming canker eats his falsehood.
4221,Henry VI Part 1,28,2.4.82,SOMERSET,"Well, I'll find friends to wear my bleeding roses,"
4222,Henry VI Part 1,28,2.4.83,SOMERSET,"That shall maintain what I have said is true,"
4223,Henry VI Part 1,28,2.4.84,SOMERSET,Where false Plantagenet dare not be seen.
4224,Henry VI Part 1,28,2.4.85,SOMERSET,RICHARD
4225,Henry VI Part 1,29,2.4.86,PLANTAGENET,"Now, by this maiden blossom in my hand,"
4226,Henry VI Part 1,29,2.4.87,PLANTAGENET,"I scorn thee and thy fashion, peevish boy."
4227,Henry VI Part 1,30,2.4.88,SUFFOLK,"Turn not thy scorns this way, Plantagenet."
4228,Henry VI Part 1,30,2.4.89,SUFFOLK,RICHARD
4229,Henry VI Part 1,31,2.4.90,PLANTAGENET,"Proud Pole, I will, and scorn both him and thee."
4230,Henry VI Part 1,32,2.4.91,SUFFOLK,I'll turn my part thereof into thy throat.
4231,Henry VI Part 1,33,2.4.92,SOMERSET,"Away, away, good William de la Pole!"
4232,Henry VI Part 1,33,2.4.93,SOMERSET,We grace the yeoman by conversing with him.
4233,Henry VI Part 1,34,2.4.94,WARWICK,"Now, by God's will, thou wrong'st him, Somerset,"
4234,Henry VI Part 1,34,2.4.95,WARWICK,"His grandfather was Lionel Duke of Clarence,"
4235,Henry VI Part 1,34,2.4.96,WARWICK,Third son to the third Edward King of England:
4236,Henry VI Part 1,34,2.4.97,WARWICK,Spring crestless yeomen from so deep a root?
4237,Henry VI Part 1,34,2.4.98,WARWICK,RICHARD
4238,Henry VI Part 1,35,2.4.99,PLANTAGENET,"He bears him on the place's privilege,"
4239,Henry VI Part 1,35,2.4.100,PLANTAGENET,"Or durst not, for his craven heart, say thus."
4240,Henry VI Part 1,36,2.4.101,SOMERSET,"By him that made me, I'll maintain my words"
4241,Henry VI Part 1,36,2.4.102,SOMERSET,On any plot of ground in Christendom.
4242,Henry VI Part 1,36,2.4.103,SOMERSET,"Was not thy father, Richard Earl of Cambridge,"
4243,Henry VI Part 1,36,2.4.104,SOMERSET,For treason executed in our late king's days?
4244,Henry VI Part 1,36,2.4.105,SOMERSET,"And, by his treason, stand'st not thou attainted,"
4245,Henry VI Part 1,36,2.4.106,SOMERSET,"Corrupted, and exempt from ancient gentry?"
4246,Henry VI Part 1,36,2.4.107,SOMERSET,"His trespass yet lives guilty in thy blood,"
4247,Henry VI Part 1,36,2.4.108,SOMERSET,"And, till thou be restored, thou art a yeoman."

4251,Henry VI Part 1,37,2.4.112,PLANTAGENET,"And that I'll prove on better men than Somerset,"
4252,Henry VI Part 1,37,2.4.113,PLANTAGENET,Were growing time once ripen'd to my will.
4253,Henry VI Part 1,37,2.4.114,PLANTAGENET,"For your partaker Pole and you yourself,"
4254,Henry VI Part 1,37,2.4.115,PLANTAGENET,"I'll note you in my book of memory,"
4255,Henry VI Part 1,37,2.4.116,PLANTAGENET,To scourge you for this apprehension:
4256,Henry VI Part 1,37,2.4.117,PLANTAGENET,Look to it well and say you are well warn'd.
4257,Henry VI Part 1,38,2.4.118,SOMERSET,"Ah, thou shalt find us ready for thee still,"
4258,Henry VI Part 1,38,2.4.119,SOMERSET,"And know us by these colours for thy foes,"
4259,Henry VI Part 1,38,2.4.120,SOMERSET,For these my friends in spite of thee shall wear.
4260,Henry VI Part 1,38,2.4.121,SOMERSET,RICHARD
4261,Henry VI Part 1,39,2.4.122,PLANTAGENET,"And, by my soul, this pale and angry rose,"

4267,Henry VI Part 1,40,2.4.128,SUFFOLK,And so farewell until I meet thee next.

4272,Henry VI Part 1,42,2.4.131,PLANTAGENET,How I am braved and must perforce endure it!
4273,Henry VI Part 1,43,2.4.132,WARWICK,This blot that they object against your house
4274,Henry VI Part 1,43,2.4.133,WARWICK,Shall be wiped out in the next parliament

4277,Henry VI Part 1,43,2.4.136,WARWICK,I will not live to be accounted Warwick.
4278,Henry VI Part 1,43,2.4.137,WARWICK,"Meantime, in signal of my love to thee,"
4279,Henry VI Part 1,43,2.4.138,WARWICK,"Against proud Somerset and William Pole,"
4280,Henry VI Part 1,43,2.4.139,WARWICK,Will I upon thy party wear this rose:
4281,Henry VI Part 1,43,2.4.140,WARWICK,"And here I prophesy: this brawl to-day,"
4282,Henry VI Part 1,43,2.4.141,WARWICK,"Grown to this faction in the Temple-garden,"
4283,Henry VI Part 1,43,2.4.142,WARWICK,Shall send between the red rose and the white

4288,Henry VI Part 1,45,2.4.147,VERNON,In your behalf still will I wear the same.
4289,Henry VI Part 1,46,2.4.148,Lawyer,And so will I.

4299,Henry VI Part 1,1,2.5.3,MORTIMER,"Even like a man new haled from the rack,"
4300,Henry VI Part 1,1,2.5.4,MORTIMER,So fare my limbs with long imprisonment.
4301,Henry VI Part 1,1,2.5.5,MORTIMER,"And these grey locks, the pursuivants of death,"
4302,Henry VI Part 1,1,2.5.6,MORTIMER,"Nestor-like aged in an age of care,"
4303,Henry VI Part 1,1,2.5.7,MORTIMER,Argue the end of Edmund Mortimer.
4304,Henry VI Part 1,1,2.5.8,MORTIMER,"These eyes, like lamps whose wasting oil is spent,"
4305,Henry VI Part 1,1,2.5.9,MORTIMER,"Wax dim, as drawing to their exigent,"
4306,Henry VI Part 1,1,2.5.10,MORTIMER,"Weak shoulders, overborne with burthening grief,"
4307,Henry VI Part 1,1,2.5.11,MORTIMER,"And pithless arms, like to a wither'd vine"
4308,Henry VI Part 1,1,2.5.12,MORTIMER,"That droops his sapless branches to the ground,"
4309,Henry VI Part 1,1,2.5.13,MORTIMER,"Yet are these feet, whose strengthless stay is numb,"
4310,Henry VI Part 1,1,2.5.14,MORTIMER,"Unable to support this lump of clay,"
4311,Henry VI Part 1,1,2.5.15,MORTIMER,"Swift-winged with desire to get a grave,"
4312,Henry VI Part 1,1,2.5.16,MORTIMER,As witting I no other comfort have.
4313,Henry VI Part 1,1,2.5.17,MORTIMER,"But tell me, keeper, will my nephew come?"
4314,Henry VI Part 1,2,2.5.18,First Gaoler,"Richard Plantagenet, my lord, will come:"
4315,Henry VI Part 1,2,2.5.19,First Gaoler,"We sent unto the Temple, unto his chamber,"
4316,Henry VI Part 1,2,2.5.20,First Gaoler,And answer was return'd that he will come.
4317,Henry VI Part 1,3,2.5.21,MORTIMER,Enough: my soul shall then be satisfied.
4318,Henry VI Part 1,3,2.5.22,MORTIMER,Poor gentleman! his wrong doth equal mine.
4319,Henry VI Part 1,3,2.5.23,MORTIMER,"Since Henry Monmouth first began to reign,"
4320,Henry VI Part 1,3,2.5.24,MORTIMER,"Before whose glory I was great in arms,"
4321,Henry VI Part 1,3,2.5.25,MORTIMER,This loathsome sequestration have I had:
4322,Henry VI Part 1,3,2.5.26,MORTIMER,"And even since then hath Richard been obscured,"
4323,Henry VI Part 1,3,2.5.27,MORTIMER,Deprived of honour and inheritance.
4324,Henry VI Part 1,3,2.5.28,MORTIMER,"But now the arbitrator of despairs,"
4325,Henry VI Part 1,3,2.5.29,MORTIMER,"Just death, kind umpire of men's miseries,"
4326,Henry VI Part 1,3,2.5.30,MORTIMER,With sweet enlargement doth dismiss me hence:
4327,Henry VI Part 1,3,2.5.31,MORTIMER,"I would his troubles likewise were expired,"
4328,Henry VI Part 1,3,2.5.32,MORTIMER,That so he might recover what was lost.
4329,Henry VI Part 1,3,,MORTIMER,Enter RICHARD PLANTAGENET
4330,Henry VI Part 1,4,2.5.33,First Gaoler,"My lord, your loving nephew now is come."
4331,Henry VI Part 1,5,2.5.34,MORTIMER,"Richard Plantagenet, my friend, is he come?"
4332,Henry VI Part 1,5,2.5.35,MORTIMER,RICHARD
4333,Henry VI Part 1,6,2.5.36,PLANTAGENET,"Ay, noble uncle, thus ignobly used,"
4334,Henry VI Part 1,6,2.5.37,PLANTAGENET,"Your nephew, late despised Richard, comes."
4335,Henry VI Part 1,7,2.5.38,MORTIMER,"Direct mine arms I may embrace his neck,"
4336,Henry VI Part 1,7,2.5.39,MORTIMER,And in his bosom spend my latter gasp:
4337,Henry VI Part 1,7,2.5.40,MORTIMER,"O, tell me when my lips do touch his cheeks,"
4338,Henry VI Part 1,7,2.5.41,MORTIMER,That I may kindly give one fainting kiss.
4339,Henry VI Part 1,7,2.5.42,MORTIMER,"And now declare, sweet stem from York's great stock,"
4340,Henry VI Part 1,7,2.5.43,MORTIMER,"Why didst thou say, of late thou wert despised?"
4341,Henry VI Part 1,7,2.5.44,MORTIMER,RICHARD
4342,Henry VI Part 1,8,2.5.45,PLANTAGENET,"First, lean thine aged back against mine arm,"
4343,Henry VI Part 1,8,2.5.46,PLANTAGENET,"And, in that ease, I'll tell thee my disease."
4344,Henry VI Part 1,8,2.5.47,PLANTAGENET,"This day, in argument upon a case,"
4345,Henry VI Part 1,8,2.5.48,PLANTAGENET,"Some words there grew 'twixt Somerset and me,"
4346,Henry VI Part 1,8,2.5.49,PLANTAGENET,Among which terms he used his lavish tongue
4347,Henry VI Part 1,8,2.5.50,PLANTAGENET,And did upbraid me with my father's death:
4348,Henry VI Part 1,8,2.5.51,PLANTAGENET,"Which obloquy set bars before my tongue,"
4349,Henry VI Part 1,8,2.5.52,PLANTAGENET,Else with the like I had requited him.
4350,Henry VI Part 1,8,2.5.53,PLANTAGENET,"Therefore, good uncle, for my father's sake,"
4351,Henry VI Part 1,8,2.5.54,PLANTAGENET,In honour of a true Plantagenet
4352,Henry VI Part 1,8,2.5.55,PLANTAGENET,"And for alliance sake, declare the cause"
4353,Henry VI Part 1,8,2.5.56,PLANTAGENET,"My father, Earl of Cambridge, lost his head."
4354,Henry VI Part 1,9,2.5.57,MORTIMER,"That cause, fair nephew, that imprison'd me"
4355,Henry VI Part 1,9,2.5.58,MORTIMER,And hath detain'd me all my flowering youth
4356,Henry VI Part 1,9,2.5.59,MORTIMER,"Within a loathsome dungeon, there to pine,"
4357,Henry VI Part 1,9,2.5.60,MORTIMER,Was cursed instrument of his decease.
4358,Henry VI Part 1,9,2.5.61,MORTIMER,RICHARD
4359,Henry VI Part 1,10,2.5.62,PLANTAGENET,"Discover more at large what cause that was,"
4360,Henry VI Part 1,10,2.5.63,PLANTAGENET,For I am ignorant and cannot guess.
4361,Henry VI Part 1,11,2.5.64,MORTIMER,"I will, if that my fading breath permit"
4362,Henry VI Part 1,11,2.5.65,MORTIMER,And death approach not ere my tale be done.
4363,Henry VI Part 1,11,2.5.66,MORTIMER,"Henry the Fourth, grandfather to this king,"
4364,Henry VI Part 1,11,2.5.67,MORTIMER,"Deposed his nephew Richard, Edward's son,"
4365,Henry VI Part 1,11,2.5.68,MORTIMER,"The first-begotten and the lawful heir,"
4366,Henry VI Part 1,11,2.5.69,MORTIMER,"Of Edward king, the third of that descent:"
4367,Henry VI Part 1,11,2.5.70,MORTIMER,"During whose reign the Percies of the north,"
4368,Henry VI Part 1,11,2.5.71,MORTIMER,"Finding his usurpation most unjust,"
4369,Henry VI Part 1,11,2.5.72,MORTIMER,Endeavor'd my advancement to the throne:
4370,Henry VI Part 1,11,2.5.73,MORTIMER,The reason moved these warlike lords to this
4371,Henry VI Part 1,11,2.5.74,MORTIMER,"Was, for that--young King Richard thus removed,"
4372,Henry VI Part 1,11,2.5.75,MORTIMER,Leaving no heir begotten of his body--
4373,Henry VI Part 1,11,2.5.76,MORTIMER,"I was the next by birth and parentage,"
4374,Henry VI Part 1,11,2.5.77,MORTIMER,For by my mother I derived am
4375,Henry VI Part 1,11,2.5.78,MORTIMER,"From Lionel Duke of Clarence, the third son"
4376,Henry VI Part 1,11,2.5.79,MORTIMER,"To King Edward the Third, whereas he"
4377,Henry VI Part 1,11,2.5.80,MORTIMER,"From John of Gaunt doth bring his pedigree,"
4378,Henry VI Part 1,11,2.5.81,MORTIMER,Being but fourth of that heroic line.
4379,Henry VI Part 1,11,2.5.82,MORTIMER,But mark: as in this haughty attempt
4380,Henry VI Part 1,11,2.5.83,MORTIMER,"They laboured to plant the rightful heir,"
4381,Henry VI Part 1,11,2.5.84,MORTIMER,I lost my liberty and they their lives.
4382,Henry VI Part 1,11,2.5.85,MORTIMER,"Long after this, when Henry the Fifth,"
4383,Henry VI Part 1,11,2.5.86,MORTIMER,"Succeeding his father Bolingbroke, did reign,"
4384,Henry VI Part 1,11,2.5.87,MORTIMER,"Thy father, Earl of Cambridge, then derived"
4385,Henry VI Part 1,11,2.5.88,MORTIMER,"From famous Edmund Langley, Duke of York,"
4386,Henry VI Part 1,11,2.5.89,MORTIMER,"Marrying my sister that thy mother was,"
4387,Henry VI Part 1,11,2.5.90,MORTIMER,Again in pity of my hard distress
4388,Henry VI Part 1,11,2.5.91,MORTIMER,"Levied an army, weening to redeem"
4389,Henry VI Part 1,11,2.5.92,MORTIMER,And have install'd me in the diadem:
4390,Henry VI Part 1,11,2.5.93,MORTIMER,"But, as the rest, so fell that noble earl"
4391,Henry VI Part 1,11,2.5.94,MORTIMER,"And was beheaded. Thus the Mortimers,"
4392,Henry VI Part 1,11,2.5.95,MORTIMER,"In whom the tide rested, were suppress'd."
4393,Henry VI Part 1,11,2.5.96,MORTIMER,RICHARD
4394,Henry VI Part 1,12,2.5.97,PLANTAGENET,"Of which, my lord, your honour is the last."
4395,Henry VI Part 1,13,2.5.98,MORTIMER,"True, and thou seest that I no issue have"
4396,Henry VI Part 1,13,2.5.99,MORTIMER,"And that my fainting words do warrant death,"
4397,Henry VI Part 1,13,2.5.100,MORTIMER,"Thou art my heir, the rest I wish thee gather:"
4398,Henry VI Part 1,13,2.5.101,MORTIMER,But yet be wary in thy studious care.
4399,Henry VI Part 1,13,2.5.102,MORTIMER,RICHARD
4400,Henry VI Part 1,14,2.5.103,PLANTAGENET,Thy grave admonishments prevail with me:
4401,Henry VI Part 1,14,2.5.104,PLANTAGENET,"But yet, methinks, my father's execution"
4402,Henry VI Part 1,14,2.5.105,PLANTAGENET,Was nothing less than bloody tyranny.
4403,Henry VI Part 1,15,2.5.106,MORTIMER,"With silence, nephew, be thou politic:"
4404,Henry VI Part 1,15,2.5.107,MORTIMER,"Strong-fixed is the house of Lancaster,"
4405,Henry VI Part 1,15,2.5.108,MORTIMER,"And like a mountain, not to be removed."
4406,Henry VI Part 1,15,2.5.109,MORTIMER,But now thy uncle is removing hence:
4407,Henry VI Part 1,15,2.5.110,MORTIMER,"As princes do their courts, when they are cloy'd"
4408,Henry VI Part 1,15,2.5.111,MORTIMER,With long continuance in a settled place.
4409,Henry VI Part 1,15,2.5.112,MORTIMER,RICHARD
4410,Henry VI Part 1,16,2.5.113,PLANTAGENET,"O, uncle, would some part of my young years"
4411,Henry VI Part 1,16,2.5.114,PLANTAGENET,Might but redeem the passage of your age!
4412,Henry VI Part 1,17,2.5.115,MORTIMER,"Thou dost then wrong me, as that slaughterer doth"
4413,Henry VI Part 1,17,2.5.116,MORTIMER,Which giveth many wounds when one will kill.
4414,Henry VI Part 1,17,2.5.117,MORTIMER,"Mourn not, except thou sorrow for my good,"
4415,Henry VI Part 1,17,2.5.118,MORTIMER,Only give order for my funeral:
4416,Henry VI Part 1,17,2.5.119,MORTIMER,"And so farewell, and fair be all thy hopes"
4417,Henry VI Part 1,17,2.5.120,MORTIMER,And prosperous be thy life in peace and war!
4418,Henry VI Part 1,17,,MORTIMER,Dies
4419,Henry VI Part 1,17,2.5.121,MORTIMER,RICHARD
4420,Henry VI Part 1,18,2.5.122,PLANTAGENET,"And peace, no war, befall thy parting soul!"
4421,Henry VI Part 1,18,2.5.123,PLANTAGENET,In prison hast thou spent a pilgrimage
4422,Henry VI Part 1,18,2.5.124,PLANTAGENET,And like a hermit overpass'd thy days.
4423,Henry VI Part 1,18,2.5.125,PLANTAGENET,"Well, I will lock his counsel in my breast,"
4424,Henry VI Part 1,18,2.5.126,PLANTAGENET,And what I do imagine let that rest.
4425,Henry VI Part 1,18,2.5.127,PLANTAGENET,"Keepers, convey him hence, and I myself"
4426,Henry VI Part 1,18,2.5.128,PLANTAGENET,Will see his burial better than his life.
4427,Henry VI Part 1,18,,PLANTAGENET,"Exeunt Gaolers, bearing out the body of MORTIMER"
4428,Henry VI Part 1,18,2.5.129,PLANTAGENET,"Here dies the dusky torch of Mortimer,"
4429,Henry VI Part 1,18,2.5.130,PLANTAGENET,Choked with ambition of the meaner sort:
4430,Henry VI Part 1,18,2.5.131,PLANTAGENET,"And for those wrongs, those bitter injuries,"
4431,Henry VI Part 1,18,2.5.132,PLANTAGENET,Which Somerset hath offer'd to my house:
4432,Henry VI Part 1,18,2.5.133,PLANTAGENET,"I doubt not but with honour to redress,"
4433,Henry VI Part 1,18,2.5.134,PLANTAGENET,"And therefore haste I to the parliament,"
4434,Henry VI Part 1,18,2.5.135,PLANTAGENET,"Either to be restored to my blood,"
4435,Henry VI Part 1,18,2.5.136,PLANTAGENET,Or make my ill the advantage of my good.
4436,Henry VI Part 1,18,,PLANTAGENET,Exit
4437,Henry VI Part 1,18,,PLANTAGENET,ACT III
4438,Henry VI Part 1,18,,PLANTAGENET,SCENE I. London. The Parliament-house.
4439,Henry VI Part 1,18,,PLANTAGENET,"Flourish. Enter KING HENRY VI, EXETER, GLOUCESTER,  WARWICK, SOMERSET, and SUFFOLK, the BISHOP OF  WINCHESTER, RICHARD PLANTAGENET, and others.  GLOUCESTER offers to put up a bill, BISHOP OF WINCHESTER snatches it, and tears it"
4440,Henry VI Part 1,18,3.1.1,PLANTAGENET,BISHOP
4441,Henry VI Part 1,1,3.1.2,OF WINCHESTER,"Comest thou with deep premeditated lines,"
4442,Henry VI Part 1,1,3.1.3,OF WINCHESTER,"With written pamphlets studiously devised,"
4443,Henry VI Part 1,1,3.1.4,OF WINCHESTER,"Humphrey of Gloucester? If thou canst accuse,"
4444,Henry VI Part 1,1,3.1.5,OF WINCHESTER,"Or aught intend'st to lay unto my charge,"
4445,Henry VI Part 1,1,3.1.6,OF WINCHESTER,"Do it without invention, suddenly,"
4446,Henry VI Part 1,1,3.1.7,OF WINCHESTER,As I with sudden and extemporal speech
4447,Henry VI Part 1,1,3.1.8,OF WINCHESTER,Purpose to answer what thou canst object.
4448,Henry VI Part 1,2,3.1.9,GLOUCESTER,"Presumptuous priest! this place commands my patience,"
4449,Henry VI Part 1,2,3.1.10,GLOUCESTER,Or thou shouldst find thou hast dishonour'd me.
4450,Henry VI Part 1,2,3.1.11,GLOUCESTER,"Think not, although in writing I preferr'd"
4451,Henry VI Part 1,2,3.1.12,GLOUCESTER,"The manner of thy vile outrageous crimes,"
4452,Henry VI Part 1,2,3.1.13,GLOUCESTER,"That therefore I have forged, or am not able"
4453,Henry VI Part 1,2,3.1.14,GLOUCESTER,Verbatim to rehearse the method of my pen:
4454,Henry VI Part 1,2,3.1.15,GLOUCESTER,"No, prelate, such is thy audacious wickedness,"
4455,Henry VI Part 1,2,3.1.16,GLOUCESTER,"Thy lewd, pestiferous and dissentious pranks,"
4456,Henry VI Part 1,2,3.1.17,GLOUCESTER,As very infants prattle of thy pride.
4457,Henry VI Part 1,2,3.1.18,GLOUCESTER,"Thou art a most pernicious usurer,"
4458,Henry VI Part 1,2,3.1.19,GLOUCESTER,"Forward by nature, enemy to peace,"
4459,Henry VI Part 1,2,3.1.20,GLOUCESTER,"Lascivious, wanton, more than well beseems"
4460,Henry VI Part 1,2,3.1.21,GLOUCESTER,"A man of thy profession and degree,"
4461,Henry VI Part 1,2,3.1.22,GLOUCESTER,"And for thy treachery, what's more manifest?"
4462,Henry VI Part 1,2,3.1.23,GLOUCESTER,"In that thou laid'st a trap to take my life,"
4463,Henry VI Part 1,2,3.1.24,GLOUCESTER,As well at London bridge as at the Tower.
4464,Henry VI Part 1,2,3.1.25,GLOUCESTER,"Beside, I fear me, if thy thoughts were sifted,"
4465,Henry VI Part 1,2,3.1.26,GLOUCESTER,"The king, thy sovereign, is not quite exempt"
4466,Henry VI Part 1,2,3.1.27,GLOUCESTER,From envious malice of thy swelling heart.
4467,Henry VI Part 1,2,3.1.28,GLOUCESTER,BISHOP
4468,Henry VI Part 1,3,3.1.29,OF WINCHESTER,"Gloucester, I do defy thee. Lords, vouchsafe"
4469,Henry VI Part 1,3,3.1.30,OF WINCHESTER,To give me hearing what I shall reply.
4470,Henry VI Part 1,3,3.1.31,OF WINCHESTER,"If I were covetous, ambitious or perverse,"
4471,Henry VI Part 1,3,3.1.32,OF WINCHESTER,"As he will have me, how am I so poor?"
4472,Henry VI Part 1,3,3.1.33,OF WINCHESTER,Or how haps it I seek not to advance
4473,Henry VI Part 1,3,3.1.34,OF WINCHESTER,"Or raise myself, but keep my wonted calling?"
4474,Henry VI Part 1,3,3.1.35,OF WINCHESTER,"And for dissension, who preferreth peace"
4475,Henry VI Part 1,3,3.1.36,OF WINCHESTER,More than I do?--except I be provoked.
4476,Henry VI Part 1,3,3.1.37,OF WINCHESTER,"No, my good lords, it is not that offends,"
4477,Henry VI Part 1,3,3.1.38,OF WINCHESTER,It is not that that hath incensed the duke:
4478,Henry VI Part 1,3,3.1.39,OF WINCHESTER,"It is, because no one should sway but he,"
4479,Henry VI Part 1,3,3.1.40,OF WINCHESTER,"No one but he should be about the king,"
4480,Henry VI Part 1,3,3.1.41,OF WINCHESTER,And that engenders thunder in his breast
4481,Henry VI Part 1,3,3.1.42,OF WINCHESTER,And makes him roar these accusations forth.
4482,Henry VI Part 1,3,3.1.43,OF WINCHESTER,But he shall know I am as good--
4483,Henry VI Part 1,4,3.1.44,GLOUCESTER,As good!
4484,Henry VI Part 1,4,3.1.45,GLOUCESTER,Thou bastard of my grandfather!
4485,Henry VI Part 1,4,3.1.46,GLOUCESTER,BISHOP
4486,Henry VI Part 1,5,3.1.47,OF WINCHESTER,"Ay, lordly sir, for what are you, I pray,"
4487,Henry VI Part 1,5,3.1.48,OF WINCHESTER,But one imperious in another's throne?
4488,Henry VI Part 1,6,3.1.49,GLOUCESTER,"Am I not protector, saucy priest?"
4489,Henry VI Part 1,6,3.1.50,GLOUCESTER,BISHOP
4490,Henry VI Part 1,7,3.1.51,OF WINCHESTER,And am not I a prelate of the church?
4491,Henry VI Part 1,8,3.1.52,GLOUCESTER,"Yes, as an outlaw in a castle keeps"
4492,Henry VI Part 1,8,3.1.53,GLOUCESTER,And useth it to patronage his theft.
4493,Henry VI Part 1,8,3.1.54,GLOUCESTER,BISHOP
4494,Henry VI Part 1,9,3.1.55,OF WINCHESTER,Unreverent Gloster!
4495,Henry VI Part 1,10,3.1.56,GLOUCESTER,Thou art reverent
4496,Henry VI Part 1,10,3.1.57,GLOUCESTER,"Touching thy spiritual function, not thy life."
4497,Henry VI Part 1,10,3.1.58,GLOUCESTER,BISHOP
4498,Henry VI Part 1,11,3.1.59,OF WINCHESTER,Rome shall remedy this.
4499,Henry VI Part 1,12,3.1.60,WARWICK,"Roam thither, then."
4500,Henry VI Part 1,13,3.1.61,SOMERSET,"My lord, it were your duty to forbear."
4501,Henry VI Part 1,14,3.1.62,WARWICK,"Ay, see the bishop be not overborne."
4502,Henry VI Part 1,15,3.1.63,SOMERSET,Methinks my lord should be religious
4503,Henry VI Part 1,15,3.1.64,SOMERSET,And know the office that belongs to such.
4504,Henry VI Part 1,16,3.1.65,WARWICK,"Methinks his lordship should be humbler,"
4505,Henry VI Part 1,16,3.1.66,WARWICK,it fitteth not a prelate so to plead.
4506,Henry VI Part 1,17,3.1.67,SOMERSET,"Yes, when his holy state is touch'd so near."
4507,Henry VI Part 1,18,3.1.68,WARWICK,"State holy or unhallow'd, what of that?"
4508,Henry VI Part 1,18,3.1.69,WARWICK,Is not his grace protector to the king?
4509,Henry VI Part 1,18,3.1.70,WARWICK,RICHARD
4510,Henry VI Part 1,19,3.1.71,PLANTAGENET,"[Aside]  Plantagenet, I see, must hold his tongue,"
4511,Henry VI Part 1,19,3.1.72,PLANTAGENET,"Lest it be said 'Speak, sirrah, when you should,"
4512,Henry VI Part 1,19,3.1.73,PLANTAGENET,Must your bold verdict enter talk with lords?'
4513,Henry VI Part 1,19,3.1.74,PLANTAGENET,Else would I have a fling at Winchester.

4516,Henry VI Part 1,20,3.1.77,KING HENRY VI,"I would prevail, if prayers might prevail,"
4517,Henry VI Part 1,20,3.1.78,KING HENRY VI,To join your hearts in love and amity.
4518,Henry VI Part 1,20,3.1.79,KING HENRY VI,"O, what a scandal is it to our crown,"
4519,Henry VI Part 1,20,3.1.80,KING HENRY VI,That two such noble peers as ye should jar!
4520,Henry VI Part 1,20,3.1.81,KING HENRY VI,"Believe me, lords, my tender years can tell"
4521,Henry VI Part 1,20,3.1.82,KING HENRY VI,Civil dissension is a viperous worm
4522,Henry VI Part 1,20,3.1.83,KING HENRY VI,That gnaws the bowels of the commonwealth.
4523,Henry VI Part 1,20,3.1.83,KING HENRY VI,"A noise within, 'Down with the tawny-coats!'"
4524,Henry VI Part 1,20,3.1.84,KING HENRY VI,What tumult's this?
4525,Henry VI Part 1,21,3.1.85,WARWICK,"An uproar, I dare warrant,"
4526,Henry VI Part 1,21,3.1.86,WARWICK,Begun through malice of the bishop's men.
4527,Henry VI Part 1,21,3.1.86,WARWICK,"A noise again, 'Stones! stones!' Enter Mayor"
4528,Henry VI Part 1,22,3.1.87,Mayor,"O, my good lords, and virtuous Henry,"
4529,Henry VI Part 1,22,3.1.88,Mayor,"Pity the city of London, pity us!"
4530,Henry VI Part 1,22,3.1.89,Mayor,"The bishop and the Duke of Gloucester's men,"
4531,Henry VI Part 1,22,3.1.90,Mayor,"Forbidden late to carry any weapon,"
4532,Henry VI Part 1,22,3.1.91,Mayor,Have fill'd their pockets full of pebble stones
4533,Henry VI Part 1,22,3.1.92,Mayor,And banding themselves in contrary parts
4534,Henry VI Part 1,22,3.1.93,Mayor,Do pelt so fast at one another's pate
4535,Henry VI Part 1,22,3.1.94,Mayor,That many have their giddy brains knock'd out:
4536,Henry VI Part 1,22,3.1.95,Mayor,Our windows are broke down in every street
4537,Henry VI Part 1,22,3.1.96,Mayor,And we for fear compell'd to shut our shops.

4542,Henry VI Part 1,23,3.1.100,KING HENRY VI,"First Serving-man	Nay, if we be forbidden stones,"
4543,Henry VI Part 1,23,3.1.101,KING HENRY VI,We'll fall to it with our teeth.

4545,Henry VI Part 1,23,,KING HENRY VI,Skirmish again

4547,Henry VI Part 1,24,3.1.104,GLOUCESTER,And set this unaccustom'd fight aside.
4548,Henry VI Part 1,24,3.1.105,GLOUCESTER,"Third Serving-man	My lord, we know your grace to be a man"
4549,Henry VI Part 1,24,3.1.106,GLOUCESTER,"Just and upright, and, for your royal birth,"
4550,Henry VI Part 1,24,3.1.107,GLOUCESTER,Inferior to none but to his majesty:

4553,Henry VI Part 1,24,3.1.110,GLOUCESTER,"To be disgraced by an inkhorn mate,"
4554,Henry VI Part 1,24,3.1.111,GLOUCESTER,We and our wives and children all will fight
4555,Henry VI Part 1,24,3.1.112,GLOUCESTER,And have our bodies slaughtered by thy foes.
4556,Henry VI Part 1,24,3.1.113,GLOUCESTER,"First Serving-man	Ay, and the very parings of our nails"
4557,Henry VI Part 1,24,3.1.114,GLOUCESTER,Shall pitch a field when we are dead.
4558,Henry VI Part 1,24,,GLOUCESTER,Begin again
4559,Henry VI Part 1,25,3.1.115,GLOUCESTER,"Stay, stay, I say!"
4560,Henry VI Part 1,25,3.1.116,GLOUCESTER,"And if you love me, as you say you do,"
4561,Henry VI Part 1,25,3.1.117,GLOUCESTER,Let me persuade you to forbear awhile.
4562,Henry VI Part 1,26,3.1.118,KING HENRY VI,"O, how this discord doth afflict my soul!"
4563,Henry VI Part 1,26,3.1.119,KING HENRY VI,"Can you, my Lord of Winchester, behold"
4564,Henry VI Part 1,26,3.1.120,KING HENRY VI,My sighs and tears and will not once relent?

4566,Henry VI Part 1,26,3.1.122,KING HENRY VI,Or who should study to prefer a peace.
4567,Henry VI Part 1,26,3.1.123,KING HENRY VI,If holy churchmen take delight in broils?
4568,Henry VI Part 1,27,3.1.124,WARWICK,"Yield, my lord protector, yield, Winchester,"
4569,Henry VI Part 1,27,3.1.125,WARWICK,Except you mean with obstinate repulse
4570,Henry VI Part 1,27,3.1.126,WARWICK,To slay your sovereign and destroy the realm.
4571,Henry VI Part 1,27,3.1.127,WARWICK,You see what mischief and what murder too
4572,Henry VI Part 1,27,3.1.128,WARWICK,"Hath been enacted through your enmity,"
4573,Henry VI Part 1,27,3.1.129,WARWICK,Then be at peace except ye thirst for blood.
4574,Henry VI Part 1,27,3.1.130,WARWICK,BISHOP
4575,Henry VI Part 1,28,3.1.131,OF WINCHESTER,"He shall submit, or I will never yield."
4576,Henry VI Part 1,29,3.1.132,GLOUCESTER,"Compassion on the king commands me stoop,"
4577,Henry VI Part 1,29,3.1.133,GLOUCESTER,"Or I would see his heart out, ere the priest"
4578,Henry VI Part 1,29,3.1.134,GLOUCESTER,Should ever get that privilege of me.
4579,Henry VI Part 1,30,3.1.135,WARWICK,"Behold, my Lord of Winchester, the duke"
4580,Henry VI Part 1,30,3.1.136,WARWICK,"Hath banish'd moody discontented fury,"
4581,Henry VI Part 1,30,3.1.137,WARWICK,As by his smoothed brows it doth appear:
4582,Henry VI Part 1,30,3.1.138,WARWICK,Why look you still so stern and tragical?
4583,Henry VI Part 1,31,3.1.139,GLOUCESTER,"Here, Winchester, I offer thee my hand."
4584,Henry VI Part 1,32,3.1.140,KING HENRY VI,"Fie, uncle Beaufort! I have heard you preach"
4585,Henry VI Part 1,32,3.1.141,KING HENRY VI,"That malice was a great and grievous sin,"
4586,Henry VI Part 1,32,3.1.142,KING HENRY VI,"And will not you maintain the thing you teach,"
4587,Henry VI Part 1,32,3.1.143,KING HENRY VI,But prove a chief offender in the same?
4588,Henry VI Part 1,33,3.1.144,WARWICK,Sweet king! the bishop hath a kindly gird.
4589,Henry VI Part 1,33,3.1.145,WARWICK,"For shame, my lord of Winchester, relent!"
4590,Henry VI Part 1,33,3.1.146,WARWICK,"What, shall a child instruct you what to do?"
4591,Henry VI Part 1,33,3.1.147,WARWICK,BISHOP
4592,Henry VI Part 1,34,3.1.148,OF WINCHESTER,"Well, Duke of Gloucester, I will yield to thee,"
4593,Henry VI Part 1,34,3.1.149,OF WINCHESTER,Love for thy love and hand for hand I give.
4594,Henry VI Part 1,35,3.1.150,GLOUCESTER,"[Aside]  Ay, but, I fear me, with a hollow heart.--"
4595,Henry VI Part 1,35,3.1.151,GLOUCESTER,"See here, my friends and loving countrymen,"
4596,Henry VI Part 1,35,3.1.152,GLOUCESTER,This token serveth for a flag of truce
4597,Henry VI Part 1,35,3.1.153,GLOUCESTER,Betwixt ourselves and all our followers:
4598,Henry VI Part 1,35,3.1.154,GLOUCESTER,"So help me God, as I dissemble not!"
4599,Henry VI Part 1,35,3.1.155,GLOUCESTER,BISHOP
4600,Henry VI Part 1,36,3.1.156,OF WINCHESTER,"[Aside]  So help me God, as I intend it not!"
4601,Henry VI Part 1,37,3.1.157,KING HENRY VI,"O, loving uncle, kind Duke of Gloucester,"
4602,Henry VI Part 1,37,3.1.158,KING HENRY VI,How joyful am I made by this contract!
4603,Henry VI Part 1,37,3.1.159,KING HENRY VI,"Away, my masters! trouble us no more,"
4604,Henry VI Part 1,37,3.1.160,KING HENRY VI,"But join in friendship, as your lords have done."
4605,Henry VI Part 1,37,3.1.161,KING HENRY VI,"First Serving-man	Content: I'll to the surgeon's."
4606,Henry VI Part 1,37,3.1.162,KING HENRY VI,"Second Serving-man	And so will I."
4607,Henry VI Part 1,37,3.1.163,KING HENRY VI,"Third Serving-man	And I will see what physic the tavern affords."

4611,Henry VI Part 1,38,3.1.166,WARWICK,We do exhibit to your majesty.
4612,Henry VI Part 1,39,3.1.167,GLOUCESTER,"Well urged, my Lord of Warwick: or sweet prince,"
4613,Henry VI Part 1,39,3.1.168,GLOUCESTER,"And if your grace mark every circumstance,"
4614,Henry VI Part 1,39,3.1.169,GLOUCESTER,"You have great reason to do Richard right,"
4615,Henry VI Part 1,39,3.1.170,GLOUCESTER,Especially for those occasions
4616,Henry VI Part 1,39,3.1.171,GLOUCESTER,At Eltham Place I told your majesty.
4617,Henry VI Part 1,40,3.1.172,KING HENRY VI,"And those occasions, uncle, were of force:"
4618,Henry VI Part 1,40,3.1.173,KING HENRY VI,"Therefore, my loving lords, our pleasure is"
4619,Henry VI Part 1,40,3.1.174,KING HENRY VI,That Richard be restored to his blood.
4620,Henry VI Part 1,41,3.1.175,WARWICK,"Let Richard be restored to his blood,"
4621,Henry VI Part 1,41,3.1.176,WARWICK,So shall his father's wrongs be recompensed.
4622,Henry VI Part 1,41,3.1.177,WARWICK,BISHOP
4623,Henry VI Part 1,42,3.1.178,OF WINCHESTER,"As will the rest, so willeth Winchester."

4625,Henry VI Part 1,43,3.1.180,KING HENRY VI,But all the whole inheritance I give
4626,Henry VI Part 1,43,3.1.181,KING HENRY VI,"That doth belong unto the house of York,"
4627,Henry VI Part 1,43,3.1.182,KING HENRY VI,From whence you spring by lineal descent.
4628,Henry VI Part 1,43,3.1.183,KING HENRY VI,RICHARD

4630,Henry VI Part 1,44,3.1.185,PLANTAGENET,And humble service till the point of death.
4631,Henry VI Part 1,45,3.1.186,KING HENRY VI,"Stoop then and set your knee against my foot,"
4632,Henry VI Part 1,45,3.1.187,KING HENRY VI,"And, in reguerdon of that duty done,"
4633,Henry VI Part 1,45,3.1.188,KING HENRY VI,I gird thee with the valiant sword of York:
4634,Henry VI Part 1,45,3.1.189,KING HENRY VI,"Rise Richard, like a true Plantagenet,"
4635,Henry VI Part 1,45,3.1.190,KING HENRY VI,And rise created princely Duke of York.
4636,Henry VI Part 1,45,3.1.191,KING HENRY VI,RICHARD
4637,Henry VI Part 1,46,3.1.192,PLANTAGENET,And so thrive Richard as thy foes may fall!
4638,Henry VI Part 1,46,3.1.193,PLANTAGENET,"And as my duty springs, so perish they"
4639,Henry VI Part 1,46,3.1.194,PLANTAGENET,That grudge one thought against your majesty!

4642,Henry VI Part 1,49,3.1.197,GLOUCESTER,Now will it best avail your majesty
4643,Henry VI Part 1,49,3.1.198,GLOUCESTER,To cross the seas and to be crown'd in France:
4644,Henry VI Part 1,49,3.1.199,GLOUCESTER,The presence of a king engenders love
4645,Henry VI Part 1,49,3.1.200,GLOUCESTER,"Amongst his subjects and his loyal friends,"
4646,Henry VI Part 1,49,3.1.201,GLOUCESTER,As it disanimates his enemies.
4647,Henry VI Part 1,50,3.1.202,KING HENRY VI,"When Gloucester says the word, King Henry goes,"
4648,Henry VI Part 1,50,3.1.203,KING HENRY VI,For friendly counsel cuts off many foes.
4649,Henry VI Part 1,51,3.1.204,GLOUCESTER,Your ships already are in readiness.
4650,Henry VI Part 1,51,,GLOUCESTER,Sennet. Flourish. Exeunt all but EXETER
4651,Henry VI Part 1,52,3.1.205,EXETER,"Ay, we may march in England or in France,"
4652,Henry VI Part 1,52,3.1.206,EXETER,Not seeing what is likely to ensue.
4653,Henry VI Part 1,52,3.1.207,EXETER,This late dissension grown betwixt the peers
4654,Henry VI Part 1,52,3.1.208,EXETER,Burns under feigned ashes of forged love
4655,Henry VI Part 1,52,3.1.209,EXETER,And will at last break out into a flame:
4656,Henry VI Part 1,52,3.1.210,EXETER,"As fester'd members rot but by degree,"
4657,Henry VI Part 1,52,3.1.211,EXETER,"Till bones and flesh and sinews fall away,"
4658,Henry VI Part 1,52,3.1.212,EXETER,So will this base and envious discord breed.
4659,Henry VI Part 1,52,3.1.213,EXETER,And now I fear that fatal prophecy
4660,Henry VI Part 1,52,3.1.214,EXETER,Which in the time of Henry named the Fifth
4661,Henry VI Part 1,52,3.1.215,EXETER,"Was in the mouth of every sucking babe,"
4662,Henry VI Part 1,52,3.1.216,EXETER,That Henry born at Monmouth should win all
4663,Henry VI Part 1,52,3.1.217,EXETER,And Henry born at Windsor lose all:
4664,Henry VI Part 1,52,3.1.218,EXETER,Which is so plain that Exeter doth wish
4665,Henry VI Part 1,52,3.1.219,EXETER,His days may finish ere that hapless time.
4666,Henry VI Part 1,52,,EXETER,Exit

4677,Henry VI Part 1,1,3.2.9,JOAN LA PUCELLE,That Charles the Dauphin may encounter them.
4678,Henry VI Part 1,2,3.2.10,First Soldier,"Our sacks shall be a mean to sack the city,"
4679,Henry VI Part 1,2,3.2.11,First Soldier,"And we be lords and rulers over Rouen,"

4692,Henry VI Part 1,8,3.2.21,BASTARD OF ORLEANS,"Now she is there, how will she specify"
4693,Henry VI Part 1,8,3.2.22,BASTARD OF ORLEANS,Where is the best and safest passage in?
4694,Henry VI Part 1,9,3.2.23,REIGNIER,"By thrusting out a torch from yonder tower,"
4695,Henry VI Part 1,9,3.2.24,REIGNIER,"Which, once discern'd, shows that her meaning is,"
4696,Henry VI Part 1,9,3.2.25,REIGNIER,"No way to that, for weakness, which she enter'd."
4697,Henry VI Part 1,9,,REIGNIER,"Enter JOAN LA PUCELLE on the top, thrusting out a torch burning"

4727,Henry VI Part 1,19,3.2.50,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"What will you do, good grey-beard? break a lance,"
4728,Henry VI Part 1,19,3.2.51,JOAN LA PUCELLE,And run a tilt at death within a chair?
4729,Henry VI Part 1,20,3.2.52,TALBOT,"Foul fiend of France, and hag of all despite,"
4730,Henry VI Part 1,20,3.2.53,TALBOT,Encompass'd with thy lustful paramours!
4731,Henry VI Part 1,20,3.2.54,TALBOT,Becomes it thee to taunt his valiant age
4732,Henry VI Part 1,20,3.2.55,TALBOT,And twit with cowardice a man half dead?
4733,Henry VI Part 1,20,3.2.56,TALBOT,"Damsel, I'll have a bout with you again,"
4734,Henry VI Part 1,20,3.2.57,TALBOT,Or else let Talbot perish with this shame.
4735,Henry VI Part 1,21,3.2.58,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Are ye so hot, sir? yet, Pucelle, hold thy peace,"
4736,Henry VI Part 1,21,3.2.59,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"If Talbot do but thunder, rain will follow."
4737,Henry VI Part 1,21,,JOAN LA PUCELLE,The English whisper together in council
4738,Henry VI Part 1,21,3.2.60,JOAN LA PUCELLE,God speed the parliament! who shall be the speaker?
4739,Henry VI Part 1,22,3.2.61,TALBOT,Dare ye come forth and meet us in the field?
4740,Henry VI Part 1,23,3.2.62,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Belike your lordship takes us then for fools,"
4741,Henry VI Part 1,23,3.2.63,JOAN LA PUCELLE,To try if that our own be ours or no.
4742,Henry VI Part 1,24,3.2.64,TALBOT,"I speak not to that railing Hecate,"
4743,Henry VI Part 1,24,3.2.65,TALBOT,"But unto thee, Alencon, and the rest,"
4744,Henry VI Part 1,24,3.2.66,TALBOT,"Will ye, like soldiers, come and fight it out?"
4745,Henry VI Part 1,25,3.2.67,ALENCON,"Signior, no."
4746,Henry VI Part 1,26,3.2.68,TALBOT,"Signior, hang! base muleters of France!"
4747,Henry VI Part 1,26,3.2.69,TALBOT,Like peasant foot-boys do they keep the walls
4748,Henry VI Part 1,26,3.2.70,TALBOT,And dare not take up arms like gentlemen.
4749,Henry VI Part 1,27,3.2.71,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Away, captains! let's get us from the walls,"
4750,Henry VI Part 1,27,3.2.72,JOAN LA PUCELLE,For Talbot means no goodness by his looks.
4751,Henry VI Part 1,27,3.2.73,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"God be wi' you, my lord! we came but to tell you"
4752,Henry VI Part 1,27,3.2.74,JOAN LA PUCELLE,That we are here.
4753,Henry VI Part 1,27,,JOAN LA PUCELLE,Exeunt from the walls
4754,Henry VI Part 1,28,3.2.75,TALBOT,"And there will we be too, ere it be long,"
4755,Henry VI Part 1,28,3.2.76,TALBOT,Or else reproach be Talbot's greatest fame!
4756,Henry VI Part 1,28,3.2.77,TALBOT,"Vow, Burgundy, by honour of thy house,"
4757,Henry VI Part 1,28,3.2.78,TALBOT,"Prick'd on by public wrongs sustain'd in France,"
4758,Henry VI Part 1,28,3.2.79,TALBOT,Either to get the town again or die:
4759,Henry VI Part 1,28,3.2.80,TALBOT,"And I, as sure as English Henry lives"
4760,Henry VI Part 1,28,3.2.81,TALBOT,"And as his father here was conqueror,"
4761,Henry VI Part 1,28,3.2.82,TALBOT,As sure as in this late-betrayed town
4762,Henry VI Part 1,28,3.2.83,TALBOT,"Great Coeur-de-lion's heart was buried,"
4763,Henry VI Part 1,28,3.2.84,TALBOT,So sure I swear to get the town or die.
4764,Henry VI Part 1,29,3.2.85,BURGUNDY,My vows are equal partners with thy vows.
4765,Henry VI Part 1,30,3.2.86,TALBOT,"But, ere we go, regard this dying prince,"
4766,Henry VI Part 1,30,3.2.87,TALBOT,"The valiant Duke of Bedford. Come, my lord,"
4767,Henry VI Part 1,30,3.2.88,TALBOT,"We will bestow you in some better place,"
4768,Henry VI Part 1,30,3.2.89,TALBOT,Fitter for sickness and for crazy age.
4769,Henry VI Part 1,31,3.2.90,BEDFORD,"Lord Talbot, do not so dishonour me:"
4770,Henry VI Part 1,31,3.2.91,BEDFORD,Here will I sit before the walls of Rouen
4771,Henry VI Part 1,31,3.2.92,BEDFORD,And will be partner of your weal or woe.
4772,Henry VI Part 1,32,3.2.93,BURGUNDY,"Courageous Bedford, let us now persuade you."
4773,Henry VI Part 1,33,3.2.94,BEDFORD,"Not to be gone from hence, for once I read"
4774,Henry VI Part 1,33,3.2.95,BEDFORD,That stout Pendragon in his litter sick
4775,Henry VI Part 1,33,3.2.96,BEDFORD,Came to the field and vanquished his foes:
4776,Henry VI Part 1,33,3.2.97,BEDFORD,"Methinks I should revive the soldiers' hearts,"
4777,Henry VI Part 1,33,3.2.98,BEDFORD,Because I ever found them as myself.
4778,Henry VI Part 1,34,3.2.99,TALBOT,Undaunted spirit in a dying breast!
4779,Henry VI Part 1,34,3.2.100,TALBOT,Then be it so: heavens keep old Bedford safe!
4780,Henry VI Part 1,34,3.2.101,TALBOT,"And now no more ado, brave Burgundy,"
4781,Henry VI Part 1,34,3.2.102,TALBOT,But gather we our forces out of hand
4782,Henry VI Part 1,34,3.2.103,TALBOT,And set upon our boasting enemy.
4783,Henry VI Part 1,34,,TALBOT,Exeunt all but BEDFORD and Attendants
4784,Henry VI Part 1,34,,TALBOT,An alarum: excursions. Enter FASTOLFE and a Captain
4785,Henry VI Part 1,35,3.2.104,Captain,"Whither away, Sir John Fastolfe, in such haste?"
4786,Henry VI Part 1,36,3.2.105,FASTOLFE,Whither away! to save myself by flight:
4787,Henry VI Part 1,36,3.2.106,FASTOLFE,We are like to have the overthrow again.
4788,Henry VI Part 1,37,3.2.107,Captain,"What! will you fly, and leave Lord Talbot?"
4789,Henry VI Part 1,38,3.2.108,FASTOLFE,"Ay,"
4790,Henry VI Part 1,38,3.2.109,FASTOLFE,"All the Talbots in the world, to save my life!"
4791,Henry VI Part 1,38,,FASTOLFE,Exit
4792,Henry VI Part 1,39,3.2.110,Captain,Cowardly knight! ill fortune follow thee!
4793,Henry VI Part 1,39,,Captain,Exit
4794,Henry VI Part 1,39,,Captain,"Retreat: excursions. JOAN LA PUCELLE, ALENCON, and CHARLES fly"
4795,Henry VI Part 1,40,3.2.111,BEDFORD,"Now, quiet soul, depart when heaven please,"
4796,Henry VI Part 1,40,3.2.112,BEDFORD,For I have seen our enemies' overthrow.
4797,Henry VI Part 1,40,3.2.113,BEDFORD,What is the trust or strength of foolish man?
4798,Henry VI Part 1,40,3.2.114,BEDFORD,They that of late were daring with their scoffs
4799,Henry VI Part 1,40,3.2.115,BEDFORD,Are glad and fain by flight to save themselves.
4800,Henry VI Part 1,40,,BEDFORD,"BEDFORD dies, and is carried in by two in his chair"
4801,Henry VI Part 1,40,,BEDFORD,"An alarum. Re-enter TALBOT, BURGUNDY, and the rest"
4802,Henry VI Part 1,41,3.2.116,TALBOT,"Lost, and recover'd in a day again!"
4803,Henry VI Part 1,41,3.2.117,TALBOT,"This is a double honour, Burgundy:"
4804,Henry VI Part 1,41,3.2.118,TALBOT,Yet heavens have glory for this victory!
4805,Henry VI Part 1,42,3.2.119,BURGUNDY,"Warlike and martial Talbot, Burgundy"
4806,Henry VI Part 1,42,3.2.120,BURGUNDY,Enshrines thee in his heart and there erects
4807,Henry VI Part 1,42,3.2.121,BURGUNDY,Thy noble deeds as valour's monuments.
4808,Henry VI Part 1,43,3.2.122,TALBOT,"Thanks, gentle duke. But where is Pucelle now?"
4809,Henry VI Part 1,43,3.2.123,TALBOT,I think her old familiar is asleep:
4810,Henry VI Part 1,43,3.2.124,TALBOT,"Now where's the Bastard's braves, and Charles his gleeks?"
4811,Henry VI Part 1,43,3.2.125,TALBOT,"What, all amort? Rouen hangs her head for grief"
4812,Henry VI Part 1,43,3.2.126,TALBOT,That such a valiant company are fled.
4813,Henry VI Part 1,43,3.2.127,TALBOT,"Now will we take some order in the town,"
4814,Henry VI Part 1,43,3.2.128,TALBOT,"Placing therein some expert officers,"
4815,Henry VI Part 1,43,3.2.129,TALBOT,"And then depart to Paris to the king,"
4816,Henry VI Part 1,43,3.2.130,TALBOT,For there young Henry with his nobles lie.
4817,Henry VI Part 1,44,3.2.131,BURGUNDY,What wills Lord Talbot pleaseth Burgundy.
4818,Henry VI Part 1,45,3.2.132,TALBOT,"But yet, before we go, let's not forget"
4819,Henry VI Part 1,45,3.2.133,TALBOT,"The noble Duke of Bedford late deceased,"
4820,Henry VI Part 1,45,3.2.134,TALBOT,But see his exequies fulfill'd in Rouen:
4821,Henry VI Part 1,45,3.2.135,TALBOT,"A braver soldier never couched lance,"
4822,Henry VI Part 1,45,3.2.136,TALBOT,"A gentler heart did never sway in court,"
4823,Henry VI Part 1,45,3.2.137,TALBOT,"But kings and mightiest potentates must die,"
4824,Henry VI Part 1,45,3.2.138,TALBOT,For that's the end of human misery.
4825,Henry VI Part 1,45,,TALBOT,Exeunt
4826,Henry VI Part 1,45,,TALBOT,SCENE III. The plains near Rouen.
4827,Henry VI Part 1,45,,TALBOT,"Enter CHARLES, the BASTARD OF ORLEANS, ALENCON, JOAN LA PUCELLE, and forces"
4828,Henry VI Part 1,1,3.3.1,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Dismay not, princes, at this accident,"
4829,Henry VI Part 1,1,3.3.2,JOAN LA PUCELLE,Nor grieve that Rouen is so recovered:
4830,Henry VI Part 1,1,3.3.3,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Care is no cure, but rather corrosive,"
4831,Henry VI Part 1,1,3.3.4,JOAN LA PUCELLE,For things that are not to be remedied.
4832,Henry VI Part 1,1,3.3.5,JOAN LA PUCELLE,Let frantic Talbot triumph for a while
4833,Henry VI Part 1,1,3.3.6,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"And like a peacock sweep along his tail,"
4834,Henry VI Part 1,1,3.3.7,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"We'll pull his plumes and take away his train,"
4835,Henry VI Part 1,1,3.3.8,JOAN LA PUCELLE,If Dauphin and the rest will be but ruled.
4836,Henry VI Part 1,2,3.3.9,CHARLES,"We have been guided by thee hitherto,"
4837,Henry VI Part 1,2,3.3.10,CHARLES,And of thy cunning had no diffidence:
4838,Henry VI Part 1,2,3.3.11,CHARLES,One sudden foil shall never breed distrust.
4839,Henry VI Part 1,3,3.3.12,BASTARD OF ORLEANS,"Search out thy wit for secret policies,"
4840,Henry VI Part 1,3,3.3.13,BASTARD OF ORLEANS,And we will make thee famous through the world.
4841,Henry VI Part 1,4,3.3.14,ALENCON,"We'll set thy statue in some holy place,"
4842,Henry VI Part 1,4,3.3.15,ALENCON,And have thee reverenced like a blessed saint:
4843,Henry VI Part 1,4,3.3.16,ALENCON,"Employ thee then, sweet virgin, for our good."
4844,Henry VI Part 1,5,3.3.17,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Then thus it must be, this doth Joan devise:"
4845,Henry VI Part 1,5,3.3.18,JOAN LA PUCELLE,By fair persuasions mix'd with sugar'd words
4846,Henry VI Part 1,5,3.3.19,JOAN LA PUCELLE,We will entice the Duke of Burgundy
4847,Henry VI Part 1,5,3.3.20,JOAN LA PUCELLE,To leave the Talbot and to follow us.
4848,Henry VI Part 1,6,3.3.21,CHARLES,"Ay, marry, sweeting, if we could do that,"
4849,Henry VI Part 1,6,3.3.22,CHARLES,"France were no place for Henry's warriors,"
4850,Henry VI Part 1,6,3.3.23,CHARLES,"Nor should that nation boast it so with us,"
4851,Henry VI Part 1,6,3.3.24,CHARLES,But be extirped from our provinces.
4852,Henry VI Part 1,7,3.3.25,ALENCON,For ever should they be expulsed from France
4853,Henry VI Part 1,7,3.3.26,ALENCON,And not have title of an earldom here.
4854,Henry VI Part 1,8,3.3.27,JOAN LA PUCELLE,Your honours shall perceive how I will work
4855,Henry VI Part 1,8,3.3.28,JOAN LA PUCELLE,To bring this matter to the wished end.
4856,Henry VI Part 1,8,,JOAN LA PUCELLE,Drum sounds afar off
4857,Henry VI Part 1,8,3.3.29,JOAN LA PUCELLE,Hark! by the sound of drum you may perceive
4858,Henry VI Part 1,8,3.3.30,JOAN LA PUCELLE,Their powers are marching unto Paris-ward.
4859,Henry VI Part 1,8,,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Here sound an English march. Enter, and pass over at a distance, TALBOT and his forces"
4860,Henry VI Part 1,8,3.3.31,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"There goes the Talbot, with his colours spread,"
4861,Henry VI Part 1,8,3.3.32,JOAN LA PUCELLE,And all the troops of English after him.
4862,Henry VI Part 1,8,,JOAN LA PUCELLE,French march. Enter BURGUNDY and forces
4863,Henry VI Part 1,8,3.3.33,JOAN LA PUCELLE,Now in the rearward comes the duke and his:
4864,Henry VI Part 1,8,3.3.34,JOAN LA PUCELLE,Fortune in favour makes him lag behind.
4865,Henry VI Part 1,8,3.3.35,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Summon a parley, we will talk with him."
4866,Henry VI Part 1,8,,JOAN LA PUCELLE,Trumpets sound a parley
4867,Henry VI Part 1,9,3.3.36,CHARLES,A parley with the Duke of Burgundy!
4868,Henry VI Part 1,10,3.3.37,BURGUNDY,Who craves a parley with the Burgundy?
4869,Henry VI Part 1,11,3.3.38,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"The princely Charles of France, thy countryman."
4870,Henry VI Part 1,12,3.3.39,BURGUNDY,"What say'st thou, Charles? for I am marching hence."
4871,Henry VI Part 1,13,3.3.40,CHARLES,"Speak, Pucelle, and enchant him with thy words."
4872,Henry VI Part 1,14,3.3.41,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Brave Burgundy, undoubted hope of France!"
4873,Henry VI Part 1,14,3.3.42,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Stay, let thy humble handmaid speak to thee."
4874,Henry VI Part 1,15,3.3.43,BURGUNDY,"Speak on, but be not over-tedious."
4875,Henry VI Part 1,16,3.3.44,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Look on thy country, look on fertile France,"
4876,Henry VI Part 1,16,3.3.45,JOAN LA PUCELLE,And see the cities and the towns defaced
4877,Henry VI Part 1,16,3.3.46,JOAN LA PUCELLE,By wasting ruin of the cruel foe.
4878,Henry VI Part 1,16,3.3.47,JOAN LA PUCELLE,As looks the mother on her lowly babe
4879,Henry VI Part 1,16,3.3.48,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"When death doth close his tender dying eyes,"
4880,Henry VI Part 1,16,3.3.49,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"See, see the pining malady of France,"
4881,Henry VI Part 1,16,3.3.50,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Behold the wounds, the most unnatural wounds,"
4882,Henry VI Part 1,16,3.3.51,JOAN LA PUCELLE,Which thou thyself hast given her woful breast.
4883,Henry VI Part 1,16,3.3.52,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"O, turn thy edged sword another way,"
4884,Henry VI Part 1,16,3.3.53,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Strike those that hurt, and hurt not those that help."
4885,Henry VI Part 1,16,3.3.54,JOAN LA PUCELLE,One drop of blood drawn from thy country's bosom
4886,Henry VI Part 1,16,3.3.55,JOAN LA PUCELLE,Should grieve thee more than streams of foreign gore:
4887,Henry VI Part 1,16,3.3.56,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Return thee therefore with a flood of tears,"
4888,Henry VI Part 1,16,3.3.57,JOAN LA PUCELLE,And wash away thy country's stained spots.
4889,Henry VI Part 1,17,3.3.58,BURGUNDY,"Either she hath bewitch'd me with her words,"
4890,Henry VI Part 1,17,3.3.59,BURGUNDY,Or nature makes me suddenly relent.
4891,Henry VI Part 1,18,3.3.60,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Besides, all French and France exclaims on thee,"
4892,Henry VI Part 1,18,3.3.61,JOAN LA PUCELLE,Doubting thy birth and lawful progeny.
4893,Henry VI Part 1,18,3.3.62,JOAN LA PUCELLE,Who joint'st thou with but with a lordly nation
4894,Henry VI Part 1,18,3.3.63,JOAN LA PUCELLE,That will not trust thee but for profit's sake?
4895,Henry VI Part 1,18,3.3.64,JOAN LA PUCELLE,When Talbot hath set footing once in France
4896,Henry VI Part 1,18,3.3.65,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"And fashion'd thee that instrument of ill,"
4897,Henry VI Part 1,18,3.3.66,JOAN LA PUCELLE,Who then but English Henry will be lord
4898,Henry VI Part 1,18,3.3.67,JOAN LA PUCELLE,And thou be thrust out like a fugitive?
4899,Henry VI Part 1,18,3.3.68,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Call we to mind, and mark but this for proof,"
4900,Henry VI Part 1,18,3.3.69,JOAN LA PUCELLE,Was not the Duke of Orleans thy foe?
4901,Henry VI Part 1,18,3.3.70,JOAN LA PUCELLE,And was he not in England prisoner?
4902,Henry VI Part 1,18,3.3.71,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"But when they heard he was thine enemy,"
4903,Henry VI Part 1,18,3.3.72,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"They set him free without his ransom paid,"
4904,Henry VI Part 1,18,3.3.73,JOAN LA PUCELLE,In spite of Burgundy and all his friends.
4905,Henry VI Part 1,18,3.3.74,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"See, then, thou fight'st against thy countrymen"
4906,Henry VI Part 1,18,3.3.75,JOAN LA PUCELLE,And joint'st with them will be thy slaughtermen.
4907,Henry VI Part 1,18,3.3.76,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Come, come, return, return, thou wandering lord:"
4908,Henry VI Part 1,18,3.3.77,JOAN LA PUCELLE,Charles and the rest will take thee in their arms.
4909,Henry VI Part 1,19,3.3.78,BURGUNDY,"I am vanquished, these haughty words of hers"
4910,Henry VI Part 1,19,3.3.79,BURGUNDY,"Have batter'd me like roaring cannon-shot,"
4911,Henry VI Part 1,19,3.3.80,BURGUNDY,And made me almost yield upon my knees.
4912,Henry VI Part 1,19,3.3.81,BURGUNDY,"Forgive me, country, and sweet countrymen,"
4913,Henry VI Part 1,19,3.3.82,BURGUNDY,"And, lords, accept this hearty kind embrace:"
4914,Henry VI Part 1,19,3.3.83,BURGUNDY,My forces and my power of men are yours:
4915,Henry VI Part 1,19,3.3.84,BURGUNDY,"So farewell, Talbot, I'll no longer trust thee."
4916,Henry VI Part 1,20,3.3.85,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"[Aside]  Done like a Frenchman: turn, and turn again!"
4917,Henry VI Part 1,21,3.3.86,CHARLES,"Welcome, brave duke! thy friendship makes us fresh."
4918,Henry VI Part 1,22,3.3.87,BASTARD OF ORLEANS,And doth beget new courage in our breasts.
4919,Henry VI Part 1,23,3.3.88,ALENCON,"Pucelle hath bravely play'd her part in this,"
4920,Henry VI Part 1,23,3.3.89,ALENCON,And doth deserve a coronet of gold.
4921,Henry VI Part 1,24,3.3.90,CHARLES,"Now let us on, my lords, and join our powers,"
4922,Henry VI Part 1,24,3.3.91,CHARLES,And seek how we may prejudice the foe.
4923,Henry VI Part 1,24,,CHARLES,Exeunt
4924,Henry VI Part 1,24,,CHARLES,SCENE IV. Paris. The palace.
4925,Henry VI Part 1,24,,CHARLES,"Enter KING HENRY VI, GLOUCESTER, BISHOP OF  WINCHESTER, YORK, SUFFOLK, SOMERSET, WARWICK,  EXETER, VERNON	BASSET, and others. To them with his Soldiers, TALBOT"
4926,Henry VI Part 1,1,3.4.1,TALBOT,"My gracious prince, and honourable peers,"
4927,Henry VI Part 1,1,3.4.2,TALBOT,"Hearing of your arrival in this realm,"
4928,Henry VI Part 1,1,3.4.3,TALBOT,"I have awhile given truce unto my wars,"
4929,Henry VI Part 1,1,3.4.4,TALBOT,To do my duty to my sovereign:
4930,Henry VI Part 1,1,3.4.5,TALBOT,"In sign, whereof, this arm, that hath reclaim'd"
4931,Henry VI Part 1,1,3.4.6,TALBOT,"To your obedience fifty fortresses,"

4934,Henry VI Part 1,1,3.4.9,TALBOT,"Lets fall his sword before your highness' feet,"
4935,Henry VI Part 1,1,3.4.10,TALBOT,And with submissive loyalty of heart
4936,Henry VI Part 1,1,3.4.11,TALBOT,Ascribes the glory of his conquest got

4941,Henry VI Part 1,3,3.4.15,GLOUCESTER,"Yes, if it please your majesty, my liege."
4942,Henry VI Part 1,4,3.4.16,KING HENRY VI,"Welcome, brave captain and victorious lord!"
4943,Henry VI Part 1,4,3.4.17,KING HENRY VI,"When I was young, as yet I am not old,"
4944,Henry VI Part 1,4,3.4.18,KING HENRY VI,I do remember how my father said
4945,Henry VI Part 1,4,3.4.19,KING HENRY VI,A stouter champion never handled sword.
4946,Henry VI Part 1,4,3.4.20,KING HENRY VI,"Long since we were resolved of your truth,"
4947,Henry VI Part 1,4,3.4.21,KING HENRY VI,"Your faithful service and your toil in war,"
4948,Henry VI Part 1,4,3.4.22,KING HENRY VI,"Yet never have you tasted our reward,"
4949,Henry VI Part 1,4,3.4.23,KING HENRY VI,"Or been reguerdon'd with so much as thanks,"
4950,Henry VI Part 1,4,3.4.24,KING HENRY VI,Because till now we never saw your face:
4951,Henry VI Part 1,4,3.4.25,KING HENRY VI,"Therefore, stand up, and, for these good deserts,"
4952,Henry VI Part 1,4,3.4.26,KING HENRY VI,"We here create you Earl of Shrewsbury,"
4953,Henry VI Part 1,4,3.4.27,KING HENRY VI,And in our coronation take your place.
4954,Henry VI Part 1,4,,KING HENRY VI,Sennet. Flourish. Exeunt all but VERNON and BASSET
4955,Henry VI Part 1,5,3.4.28,VERNON,"Now, sir, to you, that were so hot at sea,"
4956,Henry VI Part 1,5,3.4.29,VERNON,Disgracing of these colours that I wear
4957,Henry VI Part 1,5,3.4.30,VERNON,In honour of my noble Lord of York:
4958,Henry VI Part 1,5,3.4.31,VERNON,Darest thou maintain the former words thou spakest?
4959,Henry VI Part 1,6,3.4.32,BASSET,"Yes, sir, as well as you dare patronage"
4960,Henry VI Part 1,6,3.4.33,BASSET,The envious barking of your saucy tongue
4961,Henry VI Part 1,6,3.4.34,BASSET,Against my lord the Duke of Somerset.
4962,Henry VI Part 1,7,3.4.35,VERNON,"Sirrah, thy lord I honour as he is."
4963,Henry VI Part 1,8,3.4.36,BASSET,"Why, what is he? as good a man as York."
4964,Henry VI Part 1,9,3.4.37,VERNON,"Hark ye, not so: in witness, take ye that."
4965,Henry VI Part 1,9,,VERNON,Strikes him
4966,Henry VI Part 1,10,3.4.38,BASSET,"Villain, thou know'st the law of arms is such"
4967,Henry VI Part 1,10,3.4.39,BASSET,"That whoso draws a sword, 'tis present death,"
4968,Henry VI Part 1,10,3.4.40,BASSET,Or else this blow should broach thy dearest blood.
4969,Henry VI Part 1,10,3.4.41,BASSET,"But I'll unto his majesty, and crave"
4970,Henry VI Part 1,10,3.4.42,BASSET,"I may have liberty to venge this wrong,"
4971,Henry VI Part 1,10,3.4.43,BASSET,When thou shalt see I'll meet thee to thy cost.
4972,Henry VI Part 1,11,3.4.44,VERNON,"Well, miscreant, I'll be there as soon as you,"
4973,Henry VI Part 1,11,3.4.45,VERNON,"And, after, meet you sooner than you would."
4974,Henry VI Part 1,11,,VERNON,Exeunt
4975,Henry VI Part 1,11,,VERNON,ACT IV
4976,Henry VI Part 1,11,,VERNON,SCENE I. Paris. A hall of state.
4977,Henry VI Part 1,11,,VERNON,"Enter KING HENRY VI, GLOUCESTER, BISHOP OF  WINCHESTER, YORK, SUFFOLK, SOMERSET, WARWICK, TALBOT, EXETER, the Governor, of Paris, and others"
4978,Henry VI Part 1,1,4.1.1,GLOUCESTER,"Lord bishop, set the crown upon his head."
4979,Henry VI Part 1,1,4.1.2,GLOUCESTER,BISHOP
4980,Henry VI Part 1,2,4.1.3,OF WINCHESTER,"God save King Henry, of that name the sixth!"
4981,Henry VI Part 1,3,4.1.4,GLOUCESTER,"Now, governor of Paris, take your oath,"
4982,Henry VI Part 1,3,4.1.5,GLOUCESTER,"That you elect no other king but him,"
4983,Henry VI Part 1,3,4.1.6,GLOUCESTER,"Esteem none friends but such as are his friends,"
4984,Henry VI Part 1,3,4.1.7,GLOUCESTER,And none your foes but such as shall pretend
4985,Henry VI Part 1,3,4.1.8,GLOUCESTER,Malicious practises against his state:
4986,Henry VI Part 1,3,4.1.9,GLOUCESTER,"This shall ye do, so help you righteous God!"
4987,Henry VI Part 1,3,,GLOUCESTER,Enter FASTOLFE
4988,Henry VI Part 1,4,4.1.10,FASTOLFE,"My gracious sovereign, as I rode from Calais,"
4989,Henry VI Part 1,4,4.1.11,FASTOLFE,"To haste unto your coronation,"
4990,Henry VI Part 1,4,4.1.12,FASTOLFE,"A letter was deliver'd to my hands,"
4991,Henry VI Part 1,4,4.1.13,FASTOLFE,Writ to your grace from the Duke of Burgundy.
4992,Henry VI Part 1,5,4.1.14,TALBOT,Shame to the Duke of Burgundy and thee!
4993,Henry VI Part 1,5,4.1.15,TALBOT,"I vow'd, base knight, when I did meet thee next,"
4994,Henry VI Part 1,5,4.1.16,TALBOT,"To tear the garter from thy craven's leg,"
4995,Henry VI Part 1,5,,TALBOT,Plucking it off
4996,Henry VI Part 1,5,4.1.17,TALBOT,"Which I have done, because unworthily"
4997,Henry VI Part 1,5,4.1.18,TALBOT,Thou wast installed in that high degree.
4998,Henry VI Part 1,5,4.1.19,TALBOT,"Pardon me, princely Henry, and the rest"
4999,Henry VI Part 1,5,4.1.20,TALBOT,"This dastard, at the battle of Patay,"
5000,Henry VI Part 1,5,4.1.21,TALBOT,When but in all I was six thousand strong
5001,Henry VI Part 1,5,4.1.22,TALBOT,"And that the French were almost ten to one,"
5002,Henry VI Part 1,5,4.1.23,TALBOT,"Before we met or that a stroke was given,"
5003,Henry VI Part 1,5,4.1.24,TALBOT,Like to a trusty squire did run away:
5004,Henry VI Part 1,5,4.1.25,TALBOT,"In which assault we lost twelve hundred men,"
5005,Henry VI Part 1,5,4.1.26,TALBOT,Myself and divers gentlemen beside
5006,Henry VI Part 1,5,4.1.27,TALBOT,Were there surprised and taken prisoners.
5007,Henry VI Part 1,5,4.1.28,TALBOT,"Then judge, great lords, if I have done amiss,"
5008,Henry VI Part 1,5,4.1.29,TALBOT,Or whether that such cowards ought to wear
5009,Henry VI Part 1,5,4.1.30,TALBOT,"This ornament of knighthood, yea or no."
5010,Henry VI Part 1,6,4.1.31,GLOUCESTER,"To say the truth, this fact was infamous"
5011,Henry VI Part 1,6,4.1.32,GLOUCESTER,"And ill beseeming any common man,"
5012,Henry VI Part 1,6,4.1.33,GLOUCESTER,"Much more a knight, a captain and a leader."
5013,Henry VI Part 1,7,4.1.34,TALBOT,"When first this order was ordain'd, my lords,"
5014,Henry VI Part 1,7,4.1.35,TALBOT,"Knights of the garter were of noble birth,"
5015,Henry VI Part 1,7,4.1.36,TALBOT,"Valiant and virtuous, full of haughty courage,"
5016,Henry VI Part 1,7,4.1.37,TALBOT,"Such as were grown to credit by the wars,"
5017,Henry VI Part 1,7,4.1.38,TALBOT,"Not fearing death, nor shrinking for distress,"
5018,Henry VI Part 1,7,4.1.39,TALBOT,But always resolute in most extremes.
5019,Henry VI Part 1,7,4.1.40,TALBOT,He then that is not furnish'd in this sort
5020,Henry VI Part 1,7,4.1.41,TALBOT,"Doth but usurp the sacred name of knight,"
5021,Henry VI Part 1,7,4.1.42,TALBOT,"Profaning this most honourable order,"
5022,Henry VI Part 1,7,4.1.43,TALBOT,"And should, if I were worthy to be judge,"
5023,Henry VI Part 1,7,4.1.44,TALBOT,"Be quite degraded, like a hedge-born swain"
5024,Henry VI Part 1,7,4.1.45,TALBOT,That doth presume to boast of gentle blood.
5025,Henry VI Part 1,8,4.1.46,KING HENRY VI,"Stain to thy countrymen, thou hear'st thy doom!"
5026,Henry VI Part 1,8,4.1.47,KING HENRY VI,"Be packing, therefore, thou that wast a knight:"
5027,Henry VI Part 1,8,4.1.48,KING HENRY VI,"Henceforth we banish thee, on pain of death."
5028,Henry VI Part 1,8,,KING HENRY VI,Exit FASTOLFE
5029,Henry VI Part 1,8,4.1.49,KING HENRY VI,"And now, my lord protector, view the letter"
5030,Henry VI Part 1,8,4.1.50,KING HENRY VI,Sent from our uncle Duke of Burgundy.
5031,Henry VI Part 1,9,4.1.51,GLOUCESTER,"What means his grace, that he hath changed his style?"
5032,Henry VI Part 1,9,4.1.52,GLOUCESTER,"No more but, plain and bluntly, 'To the king!'"
5033,Henry VI Part 1,9,4.1.53,GLOUCESTER,Hath he forgot he is his sovereign?
5034,Henry VI Part 1,9,4.1.54,GLOUCESTER,Or doth this churlish superscription
5035,Henry VI Part 1,9,4.1.55,GLOUCESTER,Pretend some alteration in good will?
5036,Henry VI Part 1,9,4.1.56,GLOUCESTER,What's here?
5037,Henry VI Part 1,9,,GLOUCESTER,Reads
5038,Henry VI Part 1,9,4.1.57,GLOUCESTER,"'I have, upon especial cause,"
5039,Henry VI Part 1,9,4.1.58,GLOUCESTER,"Moved with compassion of my country's wreck,"
5040,Henry VI Part 1,9,4.1.59,GLOUCESTER,Together with the pitiful complaints
5041,Henry VI Part 1,9,4.1.60,GLOUCESTER,"Of such as your oppression feeds upon,"
5042,Henry VI Part 1,9,4.1.61,GLOUCESTER,Forsaken your pernicious faction
5043,Henry VI Part 1,9,4.1.62,GLOUCESTER,"And join'd with Charles, the rightful King of France.'"
5044,Henry VI Part 1,9,4.1.63,GLOUCESTER,"O monstrous treachery! can this be so,"
5045,Henry VI Part 1,9,4.1.64,GLOUCESTER,"That in alliance, amity and oaths,"
5046,Henry VI Part 1,9,4.1.65,GLOUCESTER,There should be found such false dissembling guile?
5047,Henry VI Part 1,10,4.1.66,KING HENRY VI,What! doth my uncle Burgundy revolt?
5048,Henry VI Part 1,11,4.1.67,GLOUCESTER,"He doth, my lord, and is become your foe."
5049,Henry VI Part 1,12,4.1.68,KING HENRY VI,Is that the worst this letter doth contain?
5050,Henry VI Part 1,13,4.1.69,GLOUCESTER,"It is the worst, and all, my lord, he writes."
5051,Henry VI Part 1,14,4.1.70,KING HENRY VI,"Why, then, Lord Talbot there shall talk with him"
5052,Henry VI Part 1,14,4.1.71,KING HENRY VI,And give him chastisement for this abuse.
5053,Henry VI Part 1,14,4.1.72,KING HENRY VI,"How say you, my lord? are you not content?"
5054,Henry VI Part 1,15,4.1.73,TALBOT,"Content, my liege! yes, but that I am prevented,"
5055,Henry VI Part 1,15,4.1.74,TALBOT,I should have begg'd I might have been employ'd.
5056,Henry VI Part 1,16,4.1.75,KING HENRY VI,Then gather strength and march unto him straight:
5057,Henry VI Part 1,16,4.1.76,KING HENRY VI,Let him perceive how ill we brook his treason
5058,Henry VI Part 1,16,4.1.77,KING HENRY VI,And what offence it is to flout his friends.
5059,Henry VI Part 1,17,4.1.78,TALBOT,"I go, my lord, in heart desiring still"
5060,Henry VI Part 1,17,4.1.79,TALBOT,You may behold confusion of your foes.
5061,Henry VI Part 1,17,,TALBOT,Exit
5062,Henry VI Part 1,17,,TALBOT,Enter VERNON and BASSET
5063,Henry VI Part 1,18,4.1.80,VERNON,"Grant me the combat, gracious sovereign."
5064,Henry VI Part 1,19,4.1.81,BASSET,"And me, my lord, grant me the combat too."
5065,Henry VI Part 1,20,4.1.82,YORK,"This is my servant: hear him, noble prince."
5066,Henry VI Part 1,21,4.1.83,SOMERSET,"And this is mine: sweet Henry, favour him."
5067,Henry VI Part 1,22,4.1.84,KING HENRY VI,"Be patient, lords, and give them leave to speak."
5068,Henry VI Part 1,22,4.1.85,KING HENRY VI,"Say, gentlemen, what makes you thus exclaim?"
5069,Henry VI Part 1,22,4.1.86,KING HENRY VI,And wherefore crave you combat? or with whom?
5070,Henry VI Part 1,23,4.1.87,VERNON,"With him, my lord, for he hath done me wrong."
5071,Henry VI Part 1,24,4.1.88,BASSET,"And I with him, for he hath done me wrong."
5072,Henry VI Part 1,25,4.1.89,KING HENRY VI,What is that wrong whereof you both complain?
5073,Henry VI Part 1,25,4.1.90,KING HENRY VI,"First let me know, and then I'll answer you."
5074,Henry VI Part 1,26,4.1.91,BASSET,"Crossing the sea from England into France,"
5075,Henry VI Part 1,26,4.1.92,BASSET,"This fellow here, with envious carping tongue,"
5076,Henry VI Part 1,26,4.1.93,BASSET,"Upbraided me about the rose I wear,"
5077,Henry VI Part 1,26,4.1.94,BASSET,"Saying, the sanguine colour of the leaves"
5078,Henry VI Part 1,26,4.1.95,BASSET,"Did represent my master's blushing cheeks,"
5079,Henry VI Part 1,26,4.1.96,BASSET,When stubbornly he did repugn the truth
5080,Henry VI Part 1,26,4.1.97,BASSET,About a certain question in the law
5081,Henry VI Part 1,26,4.1.98,BASSET,"Argued betwixt the Duke of York and him,"
5082,Henry VI Part 1,26,4.1.99,BASSET,With other vile and ignominious terms:
5083,Henry VI Part 1,26,4.1.100,BASSET,In confutation of which rude reproach
5084,Henry VI Part 1,26,4.1.101,BASSET,"And in defence of my lord's worthiness,"
5085,Henry VI Part 1,26,4.1.102,BASSET,I crave the benefit of law of arms.
5086,Henry VI Part 1,27,4.1.103,VERNON,"And that is my petition, noble lord:"
5087,Henry VI Part 1,27,4.1.104,VERNON,For though he seem with forged quaint conceit
5088,Henry VI Part 1,27,4.1.105,VERNON,"To set a gloss upon his bold intent,"
5089,Henry VI Part 1,27,4.1.106,VERNON,"Yet know, my lord, I was provoked by him,"
5090,Henry VI Part 1,27,4.1.107,VERNON,"And he first took exceptions at this badge,"
5091,Henry VI Part 1,27,4.1.108,VERNON,Pronouncing that the paleness of this flower
5092,Henry VI Part 1,27,4.1.109,VERNON,Bewray'd the faintness of my master's heart.
5093,Henry VI Part 1,28,4.1.110,YORK,"Will not this malice, Somerset, be left?"
5094,Henry VI Part 1,29,4.1.111,SOMERSET,"Your private grudge, my Lord of York, will out,"
5095,Henry VI Part 1,29,4.1.112,SOMERSET,Though ne'er so cunningly you smother it.
5096,Henry VI Part 1,30,4.1.113,KING HENRY VI,"Good Lord, what madness rules in brainsick men,"
5097,Henry VI Part 1,30,4.1.114,KING HENRY VI,When for so slight and frivolous a cause
5098,Henry VI Part 1,30,4.1.115,KING HENRY VI,Such factious emulations shall arise!
5099,Henry VI Part 1,30,4.1.116,KING HENRY VI,"Good cousins both, of York and Somerset,"
5100,Henry VI Part 1,30,4.1.117,KING HENRY VI,"Quiet yourselves, I pray, and be at peace."
5101,Henry VI Part 1,31,4.1.118,YORK,"Let this dissension first be tried by fight,"
5102,Henry VI Part 1,31,4.1.119,YORK,And then your highness shall command a peace.
5103,Henry VI Part 1,32,4.1.120,SOMERSET,"The quarrel toucheth none but us alone,"
5104,Henry VI Part 1,32,4.1.121,SOMERSET,Betwixt ourselves let us decide it then.
5105,Henry VI Part 1,33,4.1.122,YORK,"There is my pledge, accept it, Somerset."
5106,Henry VI Part 1,34,4.1.123,VERNON,"Nay, let it rest where it began at first."
5107,Henry VI Part 1,35,4.1.124,BASSET,"Confirm it so, mine honourable lord."
5108,Henry VI Part 1,36,4.1.125,GLOUCESTER,Confirm it so! Confounded be your strife!
5109,Henry VI Part 1,36,4.1.126,GLOUCESTER,"And perish ye, with your audacious prate!"
5110,Henry VI Part 1,36,4.1.127,GLOUCESTER,"Presumptuous vassals, are you not ashamed"
5111,Henry VI Part 1,36,4.1.128,GLOUCESTER,With this immodest clamorous outrage
5112,Henry VI Part 1,36,4.1.129,GLOUCESTER,To trouble and disturb the king and us?
5113,Henry VI Part 1,36,4.1.130,GLOUCESTER,"And you, my lords, methinks you do not well"
5114,Henry VI Part 1,36,4.1.131,GLOUCESTER,"To bear with their perverse objections,"
5115,Henry VI Part 1,36,4.1.132,GLOUCESTER,Much less to take occasion from their mouths
5116,Henry VI Part 1,36,4.1.133,GLOUCESTER,To raise a mutiny betwixt yourselves:
5117,Henry VI Part 1,36,4.1.134,GLOUCESTER,Let me persuade you take a better course.
5118,Henry VI Part 1,37,4.1.135,EXETER,"It grieves his highness: good my lords, be friends."
5119,Henry VI Part 1,38,4.1.136,KING HENRY VI,"Come hither, you that would be combatants:"
5120,Henry VI Part 1,38,4.1.137,KING HENRY VI,"Henceforth I charge you, as you love our favour,"
5121,Henry VI Part 1,38,4.1.138,KING HENRY VI,Quite to forget this quarrel and the cause.
5122,Henry VI Part 1,38,4.1.139,KING HENRY VI,"And you, my lords, remember where we are,"
5123,Henry VI Part 1,38,4.1.140,KING HENRY VI,"In France, amongst a fickle wavering nation:"
5124,Henry VI Part 1,38,4.1.141,KING HENRY VI,If they perceive dissension in our looks
5125,Henry VI Part 1,38,4.1.142,KING HENRY VI,"And that within ourselves we disagree,"
5126,Henry VI Part 1,38,4.1.143,KING HENRY VI,How will their grudging stomachs be provoked
5127,Henry VI Part 1,38,4.1.144,KING HENRY VI,"To wilful disobedience, and rebel!"
5128,Henry VI Part 1,38,4.1.145,KING HENRY VI,"Beside, what infamy will there arise,"
5129,Henry VI Part 1,38,4.1.146,KING HENRY VI,When foreign princes shall be certified
5130,Henry VI Part 1,38,4.1.147,KING HENRY VI,"That for a toy, a thing of no regard,"
5131,Henry VI Part 1,38,4.1.148,KING HENRY VI,King Henry's peers and chief nobility
5132,Henry VI Part 1,38,4.1.149,KING HENRY VI,"Destroy'd themselves, and lost the realm of France!"
5133,Henry VI Part 1,38,4.1.150,KING HENRY VI,"O, think upon the conquest of my father,"
5134,Henry VI Part 1,38,4.1.151,KING HENRY VI,"My tender years, and let us not forego"
5135,Henry VI Part 1,38,4.1.152,KING HENRY VI,That for a trifle that was bought with blood
5136,Henry VI Part 1,38,4.1.153,KING HENRY VI,Let me be umpire in this doubtful strife.
5137,Henry VI Part 1,38,4.1.154,KING HENRY VI,"I see no reason, if I wear this rose,"
5138,Henry VI Part 1,38,,KING HENRY VI,Putting on a red rose
5139,Henry VI Part 1,38,4.1.155,KING HENRY VI,That any one should therefore be suspicious
5140,Henry VI Part 1,38,4.1.156,KING HENRY VI,I more incline to Somerset than York:
5141,Henry VI Part 1,38,4.1.157,KING HENRY VI,"Both are my kinsmen, and I love them both:"
5142,Henry VI Part 1,38,4.1.158,KING HENRY VI,"As well they may upbraid me with my crown,"
5143,Henry VI Part 1,38,4.1.159,KING HENRY VI,"Because, forsooth, the king of Scots is crown'd."
5144,Henry VI Part 1,38,4.1.160,KING HENRY VI,But your discretions better can persuade
5145,Henry VI Part 1,38,4.1.161,KING HENRY VI,Than I am able to instruct or teach:
5146,Henry VI Part 1,38,4.1.162,KING HENRY VI,"And therefore, as we hither came in peace,"
5147,Henry VI Part 1,38,4.1.163,KING HENRY VI,So let us still continue peace and love.
5148,Henry VI Part 1,38,4.1.164,KING HENRY VI,"Cousin of York, we institute your grace"
5149,Henry VI Part 1,38,4.1.165,KING HENRY VI,To be our regent in these parts of France:
5150,Henry VI Part 1,38,4.1.166,KING HENRY VI,"And, good my Lord of Somerset, unite"
5151,Henry VI Part 1,38,4.1.167,KING HENRY VI,"Your troops of horsemen with his bands of foot,"
5152,Henry VI Part 1,38,4.1.168,KING HENRY VI,"And, like true subjects, sons of your progenitors,"
5153,Henry VI Part 1,38,4.1.169,KING HENRY VI,Go cheerfully together and digest.
5154,Henry VI Part 1,38,4.1.170,KING HENRY VI,Your angry choler on your enemies.
5155,Henry VI Part 1,38,4.1.171,KING HENRY VI,"Ourself, my lord protector and the rest"

5203,Henry VI Part 1,2,4.2.17,General,The period of thy tyranny approacheth.
5204,Henry VI Part 1,2,4.2.18,General,"On us thou canst not enter but by death,"
5205,Henry VI Part 1,2,4.2.19,General,"For, I protest, we are well fortified"
5206,Henry VI Part 1,2,4.2.20,General,And strong enough to issue out and fight:
5207,Henry VI Part 1,2,4.2.21,General,"If thou retire, the Dauphin, well appointed,"
5208,Henry VI Part 1,2,4.2.22,General,Stands with the snares of war to tangle thee:

5211,Henry VI Part 1,2,4.2.25,General,"And no way canst thou turn thee for redress,"
5212,Henry VI Part 1,2,4.2.26,General,But death doth front thee with apparent spoil
5213,Henry VI Part 1,2,4.2.27,General,And pale destruction meets thee in the face.
5214,Henry VI Part 1,2,4.2.28,General,Ten thousand French have ta'en the sacrament
5215,Henry VI Part 1,2,4.2.29,General,To rive their dangerous artillery

5219,Henry VI Part 1,2,4.2.33,General,This is the latest glory of thy praise
5220,Henry VI Part 1,2,4.2.34,General,"That I, thy enemy, due thee withal,"
5221,Henry VI Part 1,2,4.2.35,General,"For ere the glass, that now begins to run,"
5222,Henry VI Part 1,2,4.2.36,General,"Finish the process of his sandy hour,"
5223,Henry VI Part 1,2,4.2.37,General,"These eyes, that see thee now well coloured,"

5232,Henry VI Part 1,3,4.2.44,TALBOT,"O, negligent and heedless discipline!"
5233,Henry VI Part 1,3,4.2.45,TALBOT,"How are we park'd and bounded in a pale,"
5234,Henry VI Part 1,3,4.2.46,TALBOT,"A little herd of England's timorous deer,"
5235,Henry VI Part 1,3,4.2.47,TALBOT,Mazed with a yelping kennel of French curs!
5236,Henry VI Part 1,3,4.2.48,TALBOT,"If we be English deer, be then in blood,"
5237,Henry VI Part 1,3,4.2.49,TALBOT,"Not rascal-like, to fall down with a pinch,"
5238,Henry VI Part 1,3,4.2.50,TALBOT,"But rather, moody-mad and desperate stags,"
5239,Henry VI Part 1,3,4.2.51,TALBOT,Turn on the bloody hounds with heads of steel
5240,Henry VI Part 1,3,4.2.52,TALBOT,And make the cowards stand aloof at bay:
5241,Henry VI Part 1,3,4.2.53,TALBOT,"Sell every man his life as dear as mine,"
5242,Henry VI Part 1,3,4.2.54,TALBOT,"And they shall find dear deer of us, my friends."
5243,Henry VI Part 1,3,4.2.55,TALBOT,"God and Saint George, Talbot and England's right,"

5249,Henry VI Part 1,1,4.3.2,YORK,That dogg'd the mighty army of the Dauphin?
5250,Henry VI Part 1,2,4.3.3,Messenger,"They are return'd, my lord, and give it out"
5251,Henry VI Part 1,2,4.3.4,Messenger,"That he is march'd to Bourdeaux with his power,"
5252,Henry VI Part 1,2,4.3.5,Messenger,"To fight with Talbot: as he march'd along,"
5253,Henry VI Part 1,2,4.3.6,Messenger,By your espials were discovered
5254,Henry VI Part 1,2,4.3.7,Messenger,"Two mightier troops than that the Dauphin led,"
5255,Henry VI Part 1,2,4.3.8,Messenger,Which join'd with him and made their march for Bourdeaux.
5256,Henry VI Part 1,3,4.3.9,YORK,"A plague upon that villain Somerset,"
5257,Henry VI Part 1,3,4.3.10,YORK,That thus delays my promised supply
5258,Henry VI Part 1,3,4.3.11,YORK,"Of horsemen, that were levied for this siege!"
5259,Henry VI Part 1,3,4.3.12,YORK,"Renowned Talbot doth expect my aid,"
5260,Henry VI Part 1,3,4.3.13,YORK,And I am lowted by a traitor villain
5261,Henry VI Part 1,3,4.3.14,YORK,And cannot help the noble chevalier:
5262,Henry VI Part 1,3,4.3.15,YORK,God comfort him in this necessity!

5267,Henry VI Part 1,4,4.3.19,LUCY,"Spur to the rescue of the noble Talbot,"
5268,Henry VI Part 1,4,4.3.20,LUCY,Who now is girdled with a waist of iron
5269,Henry VI Part 1,4,4.3.21,LUCY,And hemm'd about with grim destruction:
5270,Henry VI Part 1,4,4.3.22,LUCY,"To Bourdeaux, warlike duke! to Bourdeaux, York!"
5271,Henry VI Part 1,4,4.3.23,LUCY,"Else, farewell Talbot, France, and England's honour."

5273,Henry VI Part 1,5,4.3.25,YORK,"Doth stop my cornets, were in Talbot's place!"
5274,Henry VI Part 1,5,4.3.26,YORK,So should we save a valiant gentleman
5275,Henry VI Part 1,5,4.3.27,YORK,By forfeiting a traitor and a coward.
5276,Henry VI Part 1,5,4.3.28,YORK,"Mad ire and wrathful fury makes me weep,"
5277,Henry VI Part 1,5,4.3.29,YORK,"That thus we die, while remiss traitors sleep."
5278,Henry VI Part 1,6,4.3.30,LUCY,"O, send some succor to the distress'd lord!"
5279,Henry VI Part 1,7,4.3.31,YORK,"He dies, we lose, I break my warlike word,"

5284,Henry VI Part 1,8,4.3.36,LUCY,I met in travel toward his warlike father!
5285,Henry VI Part 1,8,4.3.37,LUCY,"This seven years did not Talbot see his son,"
5286,Henry VI Part 1,8,4.3.38,LUCY,And now they meet where both their lives are done.
5287,Henry VI Part 1,9,4.3.39,YORK,"Alas, what joy shall noble Talbot have"
5288,Henry VI Part 1,9,4.3.40,YORK,To bid his young son welcome to his grave?
5289,Henry VI Part 1,9,4.3.41,YORK,"Away! vexation almost stops my breath,"
5290,Henry VI Part 1,9,4.3.42,YORK,That sunder'd friends greet in the hour of death.
5291,Henry VI Part 1,9,4.3.43,YORK,"Lucy, farewell, no more my fortune can,"
5292,Henry VI Part 1,9,4.3.44,YORK,But curse the cause I cannot aid the man.
5293,Henry VI Part 1,9,4.3.45,YORK,"Maine, Blois, Poictiers, and Tours, are won away,"

5298,Henry VI Part 1,10,4.3.49,LUCY,Sleeping neglection doth betray to loss
5299,Henry VI Part 1,10,4.3.50,LUCY,"The conquest of our scarce cold conqueror,"
5300,Henry VI Part 1,10,4.3.51,LUCY,"That ever living man of memory,"

5307,Henry VI Part 1,1,4.4.2,SOMERSET,This expedition was by York and Talbot
5308,Henry VI Part 1,1,4.4.3,SOMERSET,Too rashly plotted: all our general force
5309,Henry VI Part 1,1,4.4.4,SOMERSET,Might with a sally of the very town
5310,Henry VI Part 1,1,4.4.5,SOMERSET,Be buckled with: the over-daring Talbot
5311,Henry VI Part 1,1,4.4.6,SOMERSET,Hath sullied all his gloss of former honour
5312,Henry VI Part 1,1,4.4.7,SOMERSET,"By this unheedful, desperate, wild adventure:"
5313,Henry VI Part 1,1,4.4.8,SOMERSET,"York set him on to fight and die in shame,"
5314,Henry VI Part 1,1,4.4.9,SOMERSET,"That, Talbot dead, great York might bear the name."

5318,Henry VI Part 1,3,4.4.12,SOMERSET,"How now, Sir William! whither were you sent?"
5319,Henry VI Part 1,4,4.4.13,LUCY,"Whither, my lord? from bought and sold Lord Talbot,"
5320,Henry VI Part 1,4,4.4.14,LUCY,"Who, ring'd about with bold adversity,"
5321,Henry VI Part 1,4,4.4.15,LUCY,"Cries out for noble York and Somerset,"
5322,Henry VI Part 1,4,4.4.16,LUCY,To beat assailing death from his weak legions:
5323,Henry VI Part 1,4,4.4.17,LUCY,And whiles the honourable captain there
5324,Henry VI Part 1,4,4.4.18,LUCY,"Drops bloody sweat from his war-wearied limbs,"
5325,Henry VI Part 1,4,4.4.19,LUCY,"And, in advantage lingering, looks for rescue,"
5326,Henry VI Part 1,4,4.4.20,LUCY,"You, his false hopes, the trust of England's honour,"
5327,Henry VI Part 1,4,4.4.21,LUCY,Keep off aloof with worthless emulation.
5328,Henry VI Part 1,4,4.4.22,LUCY,Let not your private discord keep away
5329,Henry VI Part 1,4,4.4.23,LUCY,"The levied succors that should lend him aid,"
5330,Henry VI Part 1,4,4.4.24,LUCY,"While he, renowned noble gentleman,"
5331,Henry VI Part 1,4,4.4.25,LUCY,Yields up his life unto a world of odds:
5332,Henry VI Part 1,4,4.4.26,LUCY,"Orleans the Bastard, Charles, Burgundy,"
5333,Henry VI Part 1,4,4.4.27,LUCY,"Alencon, Reignier, compass him about,"
5334,Henry VI Part 1,4,4.4.28,LUCY,And Talbot perisheth by your default.
5335,Henry VI Part 1,5,4.4.29,SOMERSET,"York set him on, York should have sent him aid."
5336,Henry VI Part 1,6,4.4.30,LUCY,"And York as fast upon your grace exclaims,"
5337,Henry VI Part 1,6,4.4.31,LUCY,"Swearing that you withhold his levied host,"
5338,Henry VI Part 1,6,4.4.32,LUCY,Collected for this expedition.
5339,Henry VI Part 1,7,4.4.33,SOMERSET,"York lies, he might have sent and had the horse,"
5340,Henry VI Part 1,7,4.4.34,SOMERSET,"I owe him little duty, and less love,"
5341,Henry VI Part 1,7,4.4.35,SOMERSET,And take foul scorn to fawn on him by sending.
5342,Henry VI Part 1,8,4.4.36,LUCY,"The fraud of England, not the force of France,"
5343,Henry VI Part 1,8,4.4.37,LUCY,Hath now entrapp'd the noble-minded Talbot:

5347,Henry VI Part 1,9,4.4.41,SOMERSET,Within six hours they will be at his aid.
5348,Henry VI Part 1,10,4.4.42,LUCY,"Too late comes rescue: he is ta'en or slain,"
5349,Henry VI Part 1,10,4.4.43,LUCY,"For fly he could not, if he would have fled,"
5350,Henry VI Part 1,10,4.4.44,LUCY,"And fly would Talbot never, though he might."
5351,Henry VI Part 1,11,4.4.45,SOMERSET,"If he be dead, brave Talbot, then adieu!"
5352,Henry VI Part 1,12,4.4.46,LUCY,"His fame lives in the world, his shame in you."

5357,Henry VI Part 1,1,4.5.2,TALBOT,"To tutor thee in stratagems of war,"
5358,Henry VI Part 1,1,4.5.3,TALBOT,That Talbot's name might be in thee revived
5359,Henry VI Part 1,1,4.5.4,TALBOT,When sapless age and weak unable limbs
5360,Henry VI Part 1,1,4.5.5,TALBOT,Should bring thy father to his drooping chair.
5361,Henry VI Part 1,1,4.5.6,TALBOT,"But, O malignant and ill-boding stars!"
5362,Henry VI Part 1,1,4.5.7,TALBOT,"Now thou art come unto a feast of death,"
5363,Henry VI Part 1,1,4.5.8,TALBOT,A terrible and unavoided danger:
5364,Henry VI Part 1,1,4.5.9,TALBOT,"Therefore, dear boy, mount on my swiftest horse,"
5365,Henry VI Part 1,1,4.5.10,TALBOT,And I'll direct thee how thou shalt escape
5366,Henry VI Part 1,1,4.5.11,TALBOT,"By sudden flight: come, dally not, be gone."
5367,Henry VI Part 1,2,4.5.12,JOHN TALBOT,Is my name Talbot? and am I your son?
5368,Henry VI Part 1,2,4.5.13,JOHN TALBOT,"And shall I fly? O if you love my mother,"
5369,Henry VI Part 1,2,4.5.14,JOHN TALBOT,"Dishonour not her honourable name,"
5370,Henry VI Part 1,2,4.5.15,JOHN TALBOT,To make a bastard and a slave of me!
5371,Henry VI Part 1,2,4.5.16,JOHN TALBOT,"The world will say, he is not Talbot's blood,"
5372,Henry VI Part 1,2,4.5.17,JOHN TALBOT,That basely fled when noble Talbot stood.
5373,Henry VI Part 1,3,4.5.18,TALBOT,"Fly, to revenge my death, if I be slain."
5374,Henry VI Part 1,4,4.5.19,JOHN TALBOT,He that flies so will ne'er return again.
5375,Henry VI Part 1,5,4.5.20,TALBOT,"If we both stay, we both are sure to die."
5376,Henry VI Part 1,6,4.5.21,JOHN TALBOT,"Then let me stay, and, father, do you fly:"
5377,Henry VI Part 1,6,4.5.22,JOHN TALBOT,"Your loss is great, so your regard should be,"
5378,Henry VI Part 1,6,4.5.23,JOHN TALBOT,"My worth unknown, no loss is known in me."
5379,Henry VI Part 1,6,4.5.24,JOHN TALBOT,"Upon my death the French can little boast,"
5380,Henry VI Part 1,6,4.5.25,JOHN TALBOT,"In yours they will, in you all hopes are lost."

5382,Henry VI Part 1,6,4.5.27,JOHN TALBOT,"But mine it will, that no exploit have done:"
5383,Henry VI Part 1,6,4.5.28,JOHN TALBOT,"You fled for vantage, everyone will swear,"
5384,Henry VI Part 1,6,4.5.29,JOHN TALBOT,"But, if I bow, they'll say it was for fear."
5385,Henry VI Part 1,6,4.5.30,JOHN TALBOT,"There is no hope that ever I will stay,"
5386,Henry VI Part 1,6,4.5.31,JOHN TALBOT,If the first hour I shrink and run away.
5387,Henry VI Part 1,6,4.5.32,JOHN TALBOT,"Here on my knee I beg mortality,"
5388,Henry VI Part 1,6,4.5.33,JOHN TALBOT,Rather than life preserved with infamy.
5389,Henry VI Part 1,7,4.5.34,TALBOT,Shall all thy mother's hopes lie in one tomb?
5390,Henry VI Part 1,8,4.5.35,JOHN TALBOT,"Ay, rather than I'll shame my mother's womb."
5391,Henry VI Part 1,9,4.5.36,TALBOT,"Upon my blessing, I command thee go."
5392,Henry VI Part 1,10,4.5.37,JOHN TALBOT,"To fight I will, but not to fly the foe."
5393,Henry VI Part 1,11,4.5.38,TALBOT,Part of thy father may be saved in thee.
5394,Henry VI Part 1,12,4.5.39,JOHN TALBOT,No part of him but will be shame in me.

5397,Henry VI Part 1,15,4.5.42,TALBOT,Thy father's charge shall clear thee from that stain.
5398,Henry VI Part 1,16,4.5.43,JOHN TALBOT,"You cannot witness for me, being slain."

5400,Henry VI Part 1,17,4.5.45,TALBOT,And leave my followers here to fight and die?
5401,Henry VI Part 1,17,4.5.46,TALBOT,My age was never tainted with such shame.
5402,Henry VI Part 1,18,4.5.47,JOHN TALBOT,And shall my youth be guilty of such blame?

5404,Henry VI Part 1,18,4.5.49,JOHN TALBOT,Than can yourself yourself in twain divide:

5406,Henry VI Part 1,18,4.5.51,JOHN TALBOT,"For live I will not, if my father die."

5408,Henry VI Part 1,19,4.5.53,TALBOT,Born to eclipse thy life this afternoon.
5409,Henry VI Part 1,19,4.5.54,TALBOT,"Come, side by side together live and die."

5418,Henry VI Part 1,1,4.6.5,TALBOT,I gave thee life and rescued thee from death.
5419,Henry VI Part 1,2,4.6.6,JOHN TALBOT,"O, twice my father, twice am I thy son!"
5420,Henry VI Part 1,2,4.6.7,JOHN TALBOT,"The life thou gavest me first was lost and done,"

5422,Henry VI Part 1,2,4.6.9,JOHN TALBOT,To my determined time thou gavest new date.
5423,Henry VI Part 1,3,4.6.10,TALBOT,"When from the Dauphin's crest thy sword struck fire,"
5424,Henry VI Part 1,3,4.6.11,TALBOT,It warm'd thy father's heart with proud desire
5425,Henry VI Part 1,3,4.6.12,TALBOT,"Of bold-faced victory. Then leaden age,"
5426,Henry VI Part 1,3,4.6.13,TALBOT,"Quicken'd with youthful spleen and warlike rage,"
5427,Henry VI Part 1,3,4.6.14,TALBOT,"Beat down Alencon, Orleans, Burgundy,"
5428,Henry VI Part 1,3,4.6.15,TALBOT,And from the pride of Gallia rescued thee.

5440,Henry VI Part 1,3,4.6.27,TALBOT,"Art thou not weary, John? how dost thou fare?"
5441,Henry VI Part 1,3,4.6.28,TALBOT,"Wilt thou yet leave the battle, boy, and fly,"
5442,Henry VI Part 1,3,4.6.29,TALBOT,Now thou art seal'd the son of chivalry?
5443,Henry VI Part 1,3,4.6.30,TALBOT,"Fly, to revenge my death when I am dead:"
5444,Henry VI Part 1,3,4.6.31,TALBOT,The help of one stands me in little stead.
5445,Henry VI Part 1,3,4.6.32,TALBOT,"O, too much folly is it, well I wot,"
5446,Henry VI Part 1,3,4.6.33,TALBOT,To hazard all our lives in one small boat!
5447,Henry VI Part 1,3,4.6.34,TALBOT,"If I to-day die not with Frenchmen's rage,"
5448,Henry VI Part 1,3,4.6.35,TALBOT,To-morrow I shall die with mickle age:

5456,Henry VI Part 1,4,4.6.43,JOHN TALBOT,These words of yours draw life-blood from my heart:
5457,Henry VI Part 1,4,4.6.44,JOHN TALBOT,"On that advantage, bought with such a shame,"
5458,Henry VI Part 1,4,4.6.45,JOHN TALBOT,"To save a paltry life and slay bright fame,"
5459,Henry VI Part 1,4,4.6.46,JOHN TALBOT,"Before young Talbot from old Talbot fly,"
5460,Henry VI Part 1,4,4.6.47,JOHN TALBOT,The coward horse that bears me fail and die!
5461,Henry VI Part 1,4,4.6.48,JOHN TALBOT,"And like me to the peasant boys of France,"
5462,Henry VI Part 1,4,4.6.49,JOHN TALBOT,To be shame's scorn and subject of mischance!
5463,Henry VI Part 1,4,4.6.50,JOHN TALBOT,"Surely, by all the glory you have won,"
5464,Henry VI Part 1,4,4.6.51,JOHN TALBOT,"An if I fly, I am not Talbot's son:"
5465,Henry VI Part 1,4,4.6.52,JOHN TALBOT,"Then talk no more of flight, it is no boot,"
5466,Henry VI Part 1,4,4.6.53,JOHN TALBOT,"If son to Talbot, die at Talbot's foot."
5467,Henry VI Part 1,5,4.6.54,TALBOT,"Then follow thou thy desperate sire of Crete,"

5476,Henry VI Part 1,1,4.7.3,TALBOT,"Triumphant death, smear'd with captivity,"
5477,Henry VI Part 1,1,4.7.4,TALBOT,Young Talbot's valour makes me smile at thee:
5478,Henry VI Part 1,1,4.7.5,TALBOT,"When he perceived me shrink and on my knee,"
5479,Henry VI Part 1,1,4.7.6,TALBOT,"His bloody sword he brandish'd over me,"
5480,Henry VI Part 1,1,4.7.7,TALBOT,"And, like a hungry lion, did commence"
5481,Henry VI Part 1,1,4.7.8,TALBOT,"Rough deeds of rage and stern impatience,"
5482,Henry VI Part 1,1,4.7.9,TALBOT,"But when my angry guardant stood alone,"
5483,Henry VI Part 1,1,4.7.10,TALBOT,"Tendering my ruin and assail'd of none,"
5484,Henry VI Part 1,1,4.7.11,TALBOT,Dizzy-eyed fury and great rage of heart
5485,Henry VI Part 1,1,4.7.12,TALBOT,Suddenly made him from my side to start
5486,Henry VI Part 1,1,4.7.13,TALBOT,"Into the clustering battle of the French,"
5487,Henry VI Part 1,1,4.7.14,TALBOT,And in that sea of blood my boy did drench

5498,Henry VI Part 1,3,4.7.24,TALBOT,Speak to thy father ere thou yield thy breath!
5499,Henry VI Part 1,3,4.7.25,TALBOT,"Brave death by speaking, whether he will or no,"

5503,Henry VI Part 1,3,4.7.29,TALBOT,"Come, come and lay him in his father's arms:"
5504,Henry VI Part 1,3,4.7.30,TALBOT,My spirit can no longer bear these harms.
5505,Henry VI Part 1,3,4.7.31,TALBOT,"Soldiers, adieu! I have what I would have,"

5512,Henry VI Part 1,5,4.7.36,BASTARD OF ORLEANS,Did flesh his puny sword in Frenchmen's blood!
5513,Henry VI Part 1,6,4.7.37,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Once I encounter'd him, and thus I said:"
5514,Henry VI Part 1,6,4.7.38,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"'Thou maiden youth, be vanquish'd by a maid:'"
5515,Henry VI Part 1,6,4.7.39,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"But, with a proud majestical high scorn,"
5516,Henry VI Part 1,6,4.7.40,JOAN LA PUCELLE,He answer'd thus: 'Young Talbot was not born
5517,Henry VI Part 1,6,4.7.41,JOAN LA PUCELLE,To be the pillage of a giglot wench:'
5518,Henry VI Part 1,6,4.7.42,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"So, rushing in the bowels of the French,"

5600,Henry VI Part 1,7,5.1.23,KING HENRY VI,Than wanton dalliance with a paramour.

5607,Henry VI Part 1,8,5.1.29,EXETER,And call'd unto a cardinal's degree?
5608,Henry VI Part 1,8,5.1.30,EXETER,Then I perceive that will be verified

5701,Henry VI Part 1,1,5.3.25,JOAN LA PUCELLE,That France must vail her lofty-plumed crest

5710,Henry VI Part 1,2,5.3.32,YORK,And try if they can gain your liberty.
5711,Henry VI Part 1,2,5.3.33,YORK,"A goodly prize, fit for the devil's grace!"
5712,Henry VI Part 1,2,5.3.34,YORK,"See, how the ugly wench doth bend her brows,"
5713,Henry VI Part 1,2,5.3.35,YORK,As if with Circe she would change my shape!
5714,Henry VI Part 1,3,5.3.36,JOAN LA PUCELLE,Changed to a worser shape thou canst not be.
5715,Henry VI Part 1,4,5.3.37,YORK,"O, Charles the Dauphin is a proper man,"
5716,Henry VI Part 1,4,5.3.38,YORK,No shape but his can please your dainty eye.
5717,Henry VI Part 1,5,5.3.39,JOAN LA PUCELLE,A plaguing mischief light on Charles and thee!
5718,Henry VI Part 1,5,5.3.40,JOAN LA PUCELLE,And may ye both be suddenly surprised

5720,Henry VI Part 1,6,5.3.42,YORK,"Fell banning hag, enchantress, hold thy tongue!"
5721,Henry VI Part 1,7,5.3.43,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"I prithee, give me leave to curse awhile."

5727,Henry VI Part 1,9,5.3.46,SUFFOLK,"O fairest beauty, do not fear nor fly!"
5728,Henry VI Part 1,9,5.3.47,SUFFOLK,"For I will touch thee but with reverent hands,"
5729,Henry VI Part 1,9,5.3.48,SUFFOLK,"I kiss these fingers for eternal peace,"
5730,Henry VI Part 1,9,5.3.49,SUFFOLK,And lay them gently on thy tender side.
5731,Henry VI Part 1,9,5.3.50,SUFFOLK,"Who art thou? say, that I may honour thee."
5732,Henry VI Part 1,10,5.3.51,MARGARET,"Margaret my name, and daughter to a king,"
5733,Henry VI Part 1,10,5.3.52,MARGARET,"The King of Naples, whosoe'er thou art."
5734,Henry VI Part 1,11,5.3.53,SUFFOLK,"An earl I am, and Suffolk am I call'd."
5735,Henry VI Part 1,11,5.3.54,SUFFOLK,"Be not offended, nature's miracle,"
5736,Henry VI Part 1,11,5.3.55,SUFFOLK,Thou art allotted to be ta'en by me:
5737,Henry VI Part 1,11,5.3.56,SUFFOLK,"So doth the swan her downy cygnets save,"
5738,Henry VI Part 1,11,5.3.57,SUFFOLK,Keeping them prisoner underneath her wings.
5739,Henry VI Part 1,11,5.3.58,SUFFOLK,"Yet, if this servile usage once offend."
5740,Henry VI Part 1,11,5.3.59,SUFFOLK,"Go, and be free again, as Suffolk's friend."
5741,Henry VI Part 1,11,,SUFFOLK,She is going
5742,Henry VI Part 1,11,5.3.60,SUFFOLK,"O, stay! I have no power to let her pass,"
5743,Henry VI Part 1,11,5.3.61,SUFFOLK,"My hand would free her, but my heart says no"
5744,Henry VI Part 1,11,5.3.62,SUFFOLK,"As plays the sun upon the glassy streams,"
5745,Henry VI Part 1,11,5.3.63,SUFFOLK,"Twinkling another counterfeited beam,"
5746,Henry VI Part 1,11,5.3.64,SUFFOLK,So seems this gorgeous beauty to mine eyes.
5747,Henry VI Part 1,11,5.3.65,SUFFOLK,"Fain would I woo her, yet I dare not speak:"
5748,Henry VI Part 1,11,5.3.66,SUFFOLK,"I'll call for pen and ink, and write my mind."
5749,Henry VI Part 1,11,5.3.67,SUFFOLK,"Fie, de la Pole! disable not thyself,"
5750,Henry VI Part 1,11,5.3.68,SUFFOLK,Hast not a tongue? is she not here?
5751,Henry VI Part 1,11,5.3.69,SUFFOLK,Wilt thou be daunted at a woman's sight?
5752,Henry VI Part 1,11,5.3.70,SUFFOLK,"Ay, beauty's princely majesty is such,"
5753,Henry VI Part 1,11,5.3.71,SUFFOLK,Confounds the tongue and makes the senses rough.
5754,Henry VI Part 1,12,5.3.72,MARGARET,"Say, Earl of Suffolk--if thy name be so--"
5755,Henry VI Part 1,12,5.3.73,MARGARET,What ransom must I pay before I pass?
5756,Henry VI Part 1,12,5.3.74,MARGARET,For I perceive I am thy prisoner.
5757,Henry VI Part 1,13,5.3.75,SUFFOLK,"How canst thou tell she will deny thy suit,"
5758,Henry VI Part 1,13,5.3.76,SUFFOLK,Before thou make a trial of her love?
5759,Henry VI Part 1,14,5.3.77,MARGARET,Why speak'st thou not? what ransom must I pay?
5760,Henry VI Part 1,15,5.3.78,SUFFOLK,"She's beautiful, and therefore to be woo'd,"
5761,Henry VI Part 1,15,5.3.79,SUFFOLK,"She is a woman, therefore to be won."
5762,Henry VI Part 1,16,5.3.80,MARGARET,"Wilt thou accept of ransom? yea, or no."
5763,Henry VI Part 1,17,5.3.81,SUFFOLK,"Fond man, remember that thou hast a wife,"
5764,Henry VI Part 1,17,5.3.82,SUFFOLK,Then how can Margaret be thy paramour?
5765,Henry VI Part 1,18,5.3.83,MARGARET,"I were best to leave him, for he will not hear."
5766,Henry VI Part 1,19,5.3.84,SUFFOLK,"There all is marr'd, there lies a cooling card."
5767,Henry VI Part 1,20,5.3.85,MARGARET,"He talks at random, sure, the man is mad."
5768,Henry VI Part 1,21,5.3.86,SUFFOLK,And yet a dispensation may be had.
5769,Henry VI Part 1,22,5.3.87,MARGARET,And yet I would that you would answer me.
5770,Henry VI Part 1,23,5.3.88,SUFFOLK,I'll win this Lady Margaret. For whom?
5771,Henry VI Part 1,23,5.3.89,SUFFOLK,"Why, for my king: tush, that's a wooden thing!"
5772,Henry VI Part 1,24,5.3.90,MARGARET,He talks of wood: it is some carpenter.
5773,Henry VI Part 1,25,5.3.91,SUFFOLK,"Yet so my fancy may be satisfied,"
5774,Henry VI Part 1,25,5.3.92,SUFFOLK,And peace established between these realms
5775,Henry VI Part 1,25,5.3.93,SUFFOLK,"But there remains a scruple in that too,"
5776,Henry VI Part 1,25,5.3.94,SUFFOLK,"For though her father be the King of Naples,"
5777,Henry VI Part 1,25,5.3.95,SUFFOLK,"Duke of Anjou and Maine, yet is he poor,"
5778,Henry VI Part 1,25,5.3.96,SUFFOLK,And our nobility will scorn the match.
5779,Henry VI Part 1,26,5.3.97,MARGARET,"Hear ye, captain, are you not at leisure?"
5780,Henry VI Part 1,27,5.3.98,SUFFOLK,"It shall be so, disdain they ne'er so much."
5781,Henry VI Part 1,27,5.3.99,SUFFOLK,Henry is youthful and will quickly yield.
5782,Henry VI Part 1,27,5.3.100,SUFFOLK,"Madam, I have a secret to reveal."
5783,Henry VI Part 1,28,5.3.101,MARGARET,"What though I be enthrall'd? he seems a knight,"
5784,Henry VI Part 1,28,5.3.102,MARGARET,And will not any way dishonour me.
5785,Henry VI Part 1,29,5.3.103,SUFFOLK,"Lady, vouchsafe to listen what I say."
5786,Henry VI Part 1,30,5.3.104,MARGARET,"Perhaps I shall be rescued by the French,"
5787,Henry VI Part 1,30,5.3.105,MARGARET,And then I need not crave his courtesy.
5788,Henry VI Part 1,31,5.3.106,SUFFOLK,"Sweet madam, give me a hearing in a cause--"
5789,Henry VI Part 1,32,5.3.107,MARGARET,"Tush, women have been captivate ere now."
5790,Henry VI Part 1,33,5.3.108,SUFFOLK,"Lady, wherefore talk you so?"
5791,Henry VI Part 1,34,5.3.109,MARGARET,"I cry you mercy, 'tis but Quid for Quo."
5792,Henry VI Part 1,35,5.3.110,SUFFOLK,"Say, gentle princess, would you not suppose"
5793,Henry VI Part 1,35,5.3.111,SUFFOLK,"Your bondage happy, to be made a queen?"
5794,Henry VI Part 1,36,5.3.112,MARGARET,To be a queen in bondage is more vile
5795,Henry VI Part 1,36,5.3.113,MARGARET,"Than is a slave in base servility,"
5796,Henry VI Part 1,36,5.3.114,MARGARET,For princes should be free.
5797,Henry VI Part 1,37,5.3.115,SUFFOLK,"And so shall you,"
5798,Henry VI Part 1,37,5.3.116,SUFFOLK,If happy England's royal king be free.
5799,Henry VI Part 1,38,5.3.117,MARGARET,"Why, what concerns his freedom unto me?"
5800,Henry VI Part 1,39,5.3.118,SUFFOLK,"I'll undertake to make thee Henry's queen,"
5801,Henry VI Part 1,39,5.3.119,SUFFOLK,To put a golden sceptre in thy hand
5802,Henry VI Part 1,39,5.3.120,SUFFOLK,"And set a precious crown upon thy head,"
5803,Henry VI Part 1,39,5.3.121,SUFFOLK,If thou wilt condescend to be my--
5804,Henry VI Part 1,40,5.3.122,MARGARET,What?
5805,Henry VI Part 1,41,5.3.123,SUFFOLK,His love.
5806,Henry VI Part 1,42,5.3.124,MARGARET,I am unworthy to be Henry's wife.
5807,Henry VI Part 1,43,5.3.125,SUFFOLK,"No, gentle madam, I unworthy am"
5808,Henry VI Part 1,43,5.3.126,SUFFOLK,"To woo so fair a dame to be his wife,"
5809,Henry VI Part 1,43,5.3.127,SUFFOLK,And have no portion in the choice myself.
5810,Henry VI Part 1,43,5.3.128,SUFFOLK,"How say you, madam, are ye so content?"
5811,Henry VI Part 1,44,5.3.129,MARGARET,"An if my father please, I am content."
5812,Henry VI Part 1,45,5.3.130,SUFFOLK,Then call our captains and our colours forth.
5813,Henry VI Part 1,45,5.3.131,SUFFOLK,"And, madam, at your father's castle walls"
5814,Henry VI Part 1,45,5.3.132,SUFFOLK,"We'll crave a parley, to confer with him."
5815,Henry VI Part 1,45,,SUFFOLK,A parley sounded. Enter REIGNIER on the walls
5816,Henry VI Part 1,45,5.3.133,SUFFOLK,"See, Reignier, see, thy daughter prisoner!"
5817,Henry VI Part 1,46,5.3.134,REIGNIER,To whom?
5818,Henry VI Part 1,47,5.3.135,SUFFOLK,To me.
5819,Henry VI Part 1,48,5.3.136,REIGNIER,"Suffolk, what remedy?"
5820,Henry VI Part 1,48,5.3.137,REIGNIER,"I am a soldier, and unapt to weep,"
5821,Henry VI Part 1,48,5.3.138,REIGNIER,Or to exclaim on fortune's fickleness.
5822,Henry VI Part 1,49,5.3.139,SU FFOLK,"Yes, there is remedy enough, my lord:"
5823,Henry VI Part 1,49,5.3.140,SU FFOLK,"Consent, and for thy honour give consent,"
5824,Henry VI Part 1,49,5.3.141,SU FFOLK,"Thy daughter shall be wedded to my king,"
5825,Henry VI Part 1,49,5.3.142,SU FFOLK,"Whom I with pain have woo'd and won thereto,"
5826,Henry VI Part 1,49,5.3.143,SU FFOLK,And this her easy-held imprisonment
5827,Henry VI Part 1,49,5.3.144,SU FFOLK,Hath gained thy daughter princely liberty.
5828,Henry VI Part 1,50,5.3.145,REIGNIER,Speaks Suffolk as he thinks?
5829,Henry VI Part 1,51,5.3.146,SUFFOLK,Fair Margaret knows
5830,Henry VI Part 1,51,5.3.147,SUFFOLK,"That Suffolk doth not flatter, face, or feign."
5831,Henry VI Part 1,52,5.3.148,REIGNIER,"Upon thy princely warrant, I descend"
5832,Henry VI Part 1,52,5.3.149,REIGNIER,To give thee answer of thy just demand.
5833,Henry VI Part 1,52,,REIGNIER,Exit from the walls
5834,Henry VI Part 1,53,5.3.150,SUFFOLK,And here I will expect thy coming.
5835,Henry VI Part 1,53,,SUFFOLK,"Trumpets sound. Enter REIGNIER, below"
5836,Henry VI Part 1,54,5.3.151,REIGNIER,"Welcome, brave earl, into our territories:"
5837,Henry VI Part 1,54,5.3.152,REIGNIER,Command in Anjou what your honour pleases.
5838,Henry VI Part 1,55,5.3.153,SUFFOLK,"Thanks, Reignier, happy for so sweet a child,"
5839,Henry VI Part 1,55,5.3.154,SUFFOLK,Fit to be made companion with a king:
5840,Henry VI Part 1,55,5.3.155,SUFFOLK,What answer makes your grace unto my suit?
5841,Henry VI Part 1,56,5.3.156,REIGNIER,Since thou dost deign to woo her little worth
5842,Henry VI Part 1,56,5.3.157,REIGNIER,"To be the princely bride of such a lord,"
5843,Henry VI Part 1,56,5.3.158,REIGNIER,Upon condition I may quietly
5844,Henry VI Part 1,56,5.3.159,REIGNIER,"Enjoy mine own, the country Maine and Anjou,"
5845,Henry VI Part 1,56,5.3.160,REIGNIER,"Free from oppression or the stroke of war,"
5846,Henry VI Part 1,56,5.3.161,REIGNIER,"My daughter shall be Henry's, if he please."
5847,Henry VI Part 1,57,5.3.162,SUFFOLK,"That is her ransom, I deliver her,"
5848,Henry VI Part 1,57,5.3.163,SUFFOLK,And those two counties I will undertake
5849,Henry VI Part 1,57,5.3.164,SUFFOLK,Your grace shall well and quietly enjoy.
5850,Henry VI Part 1,58,5.3.165,REIGNIER,"And I again, in Henry's royal name,"
5851,Henry VI Part 1,58,5.3.166,REIGNIER,"As deputy unto that gracious king,"
5852,Henry VI Part 1,58,5.3.167,REIGNIER,"Give thee her hand, for sign of plighted faith."
5853,Henry VI Part 1,59,5.3.168,SUFFOLK,"Reignier of France, I give thee kingly thanks,"
5854,Henry VI Part 1,59,5.3.169,SUFFOLK,Because this is in traffic of a king.
5855,Henry VI Part 1,59,,SUFFOLK,Aside
5856,Henry VI Part 1,59,5.3.170,SUFFOLK,"And yet, methinks, I could be well content"
5857,Henry VI Part 1,59,5.3.171,SUFFOLK,To be mine own attorney in this case.
5858,Henry VI Part 1,59,5.3.172,SUFFOLK,"I'll over then to England with this news,"
5859,Henry VI Part 1,59,5.3.173,SUFFOLK,And make this marriage to be solemnized.
5860,Henry VI Part 1,59,5.3.174,SUFFOLK,"So farewell, Reignier: set this diamond safe"
5861,Henry VI Part 1,59,5.3.175,SUFFOLK,"In golden palaces, as it becomes."
5862,Henry VI Part 1,60,5.3.176,REIGNIER,"I do embrace thee, as I would embrace"
5863,Henry VI Part 1,60,5.3.177,REIGNIER,"The Christian prince, King Henry, were he here."
5864,Henry VI Part 1,61,5.3.178,MARGARET,"Farewell, my lord: good wishes, praise and prayers"
5865,Henry VI Part 1,61,5.3.179,MARGARET,Shall Suffolk ever have of Margaret.
5866,Henry VI Part 1,61,,MARGARET,Going
5867,Henry VI Part 1,62,5.3.180,SUFFOLK,"Farewell, sweet madam: but hark you, Margaret,"
5868,Henry VI Part 1,62,5.3.181,SUFFOLK,No princely commendations to my king?
5869,Henry VI Part 1,63,5.3.182,MARGARET,"Such commendations as becomes a maid,"
5870,Henry VI Part 1,63,5.3.183,MARGARET,"A virgin and his servant, say to him."
5871,Henry VI Part 1,64,5.3.184,SUFFOLK,Words sweetly placed and modestly directed.
5872,Henry VI Part 1,64,5.3.185,SUFFOLK,"But madam, I must trouble you again,"
5873,Henry VI Part 1,64,5.3.186,SUFFOLK,No loving token to his majesty?
5874,Henry VI Part 1,65,5.3.187,MARGARET,"Yes, my good lord, a pure unspotted heart,"
5875,Henry VI Part 1,65,5.3.188,MARGARET,"Never yet taint with love, I send the king."
5876,Henry VI Part 1,66,5.3.189,SUFFOLK,And this withal.
5877,Henry VI Part 1,66,,SUFFOLK,Kisses her
5878,Henry VI Part 1,67,5.3.190,MARGARET,That for thyself: I will not so presume
5879,Henry VI Part 1,67,5.3.191,MARGARET,To send such peevish tokens to a king.
5880,Henry VI Part 1,67,,MARGARET,Exeunt REIGNIER and MARGARET
5881,Henry VI Part 1,68,5.3.192,SUFFOLK,"O, wert thou for myself! But, Suffolk, stay,"
5882,Henry VI Part 1,68,5.3.193,SUFFOLK,"Thou mayst not wander in that labyrinth,"
5883,Henry VI Part 1,68,5.3.194,SUFFOLK,There Minotaurs and ugly treasons lurk.
5884,Henry VI Part 1,68,5.3.195,SUFFOLK,Solicit Henry with her wondrous praise:
5885,Henry VI Part 1,68,5.3.196,SUFFOLK,"Bethink thee on her virtues that surmount,"
5886,Henry VI Part 1,68,5.3.197,SUFFOLK,"And natural graces that extinguish art,"
5887,Henry VI Part 1,68,5.3.198,SUFFOLK,"Repeat their semblance often on the seas,"
5888,Henry VI Part 1,68,5.3.199,SUFFOLK,"That, when thou comest to kneel at Henry's feet,"
5889,Henry VI Part 1,68,5.3.200,SUFFOLK,Thou mayst bereave him of his wits with wonder.
5890,Henry VI Part 1,68,,SUFFOLK,Exit
5891,Henry VI Part 1,68,,SUFFOLK,SCENE IV. Camp of the YORK in Anjou.
5892,Henry VI Part 1,68,,SUFFOLK,"Enter YORK, WARWICK, and others"
5893,Henry VI Part 1,1,5.4.1,YORK,Bring forth that sorceress condemn'd to burn.
5894,Henry VI Part 1,1,,YORK,"Enter JOAN LA PUCELLE, guarded, and a Shepherd"
5895,Henry VI Part 1,2,5.4.2,Shepherd,"Ah, Joan, this kills thy father's heart outright!"
5896,Henry VI Part 1,2,5.4.3,Shepherd,"Have I sought every country far and near,"
5897,Henry VI Part 1,2,5.4.4,Shepherd,"And, now it is my chance to find thee out,"
5898,Henry VI Part 1,2,5.4.5,Shepherd,Must I behold thy timeless cruel death?
5899,Henry VI Part 1,2,5.4.6,Shepherd,"Ah, Joan, sweet daughter Joan, I'll die with thee!"
5900,Henry VI Part 1,3,5.4.7,JOAN LA PUCELLE,Decrepit miser! base ignoble wretch!
5901,Henry VI Part 1,3,5.4.8,JOAN LA PUCELLE,I am descended of a gentler blood:
5902,Henry VI Part 1,3,5.4.9,JOAN LA PUCELLE,Thou art no father nor no friend of mine.
5903,Henry VI Part 1,4,5.4.10,Shepherd,"Out, out! My lords, an please you, 'tis not so,"
5904,Henry VI Part 1,4,5.4.11,Shepherd,"I did beget her, all the parish knows:"
5905,Henry VI Part 1,4,5.4.12,Shepherd,"Her mother liveth yet, can testify"
5906,Henry VI Part 1,4,5.4.13,Shepherd,She was the first fruit of my bachelorship.
5907,Henry VI Part 1,5,5.4.14,WARWICK,Graceless! wilt thou deny thy parentage?
5908,Henry VI Part 1,6,5.4.15,YORK,"This argues what her kind of life hath been,"
5909,Henry VI Part 1,6,5.4.16,YORK,"Wicked and vile, and so her death concludes."
5910,Henry VI Part 1,7,5.4.17,Shepherd,"Fie, Joan, that thou wilt be so obstacle!"
5911,Henry VI Part 1,7,5.4.18,Shepherd,"God knows thou art a collop of my flesh,"
5912,Henry VI Part 1,7,5.4.19,Shepherd,And for thy sake have I shed many a tear:
5913,Henry VI Part 1,7,5.4.20,Shepherd,"Deny me not, I prithee, gentle Joan."
5914,Henry VI Part 1,8,5.4.21,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Peasant, avaunt! You have suborn'd this man,"
5915,Henry VI Part 1,8,5.4.22,JOAN LA PUCELLE,Of purpose to obscure my noble birth.
5916,Henry VI Part 1,9,5.4.23,Shepherd,"'Tis true, I gave a noble to the priest"
5917,Henry VI Part 1,9,5.4.24,Shepherd,The morn that I was wedded to her mother.
5918,Henry VI Part 1,9,5.4.25,Shepherd,"Kneel down and take my blessing, good my girl."
5919,Henry VI Part 1,9,5.4.26,Shepherd,Wilt thou not stoop? Now cursed be the time
5920,Henry VI Part 1,9,5.4.27,Shepherd,Of thy nativity! I would the milk
5921,Henry VI Part 1,9,5.4.28,Shepherd,"Thy mother gave thee when thou suck'dst her breast,"
5922,Henry VI Part 1,9,5.4.29,Shepherd,Had been a little ratsbane for thy sake!
5923,Henry VI Part 1,9,5.4.30,Shepherd,"Or else, when thou didst keep my lambs a-field,"
5924,Henry VI Part 1,9,5.4.31,Shepherd,I wish some ravenous wolf had eaten thee!
5925,Henry VI Part 1,9,5.4.32,Shepherd,"Dost thou deny thy father, cursed drab?"
5926,Henry VI Part 1,9,5.4.33,Shepherd,"O, burn her, burn her! hanging is too good."
5927,Henry VI Part 1,9,,Shepherd,Exit
5928,Henry VI Part 1,10,5.4.34,YORK,"Take her away, for she hath lived too long,"
5929,Henry VI Part 1,10,5.4.35,YORK,To fill the world with vicious qualities.
5930,Henry VI Part 1,11,5.4.36,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"First, let me tell you whom you have condemn'd:"
5931,Henry VI Part 1,11,5.4.37,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Not me begotten of a shepherd swain,"
5932,Henry VI Part 1,11,5.4.38,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"But issued from the progeny of kings,"
5933,Henry VI Part 1,11,5.4.39,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Virtuous and holy, chosen from above,"
5934,Henry VI Part 1,11,5.4.40,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"By inspiration of celestial grace,"
5935,Henry VI Part 1,11,5.4.41,JOAN LA PUCELLE,To work exceeding miracles on earth.
5936,Henry VI Part 1,11,5.4.42,JOAN LA PUCELLE,I never had to do with wicked spirits:
5937,Henry VI Part 1,11,5.4.43,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"But you, that are polluted with your lusts,"
5938,Henry VI Part 1,11,5.4.44,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Stain'd with the guiltless blood of innocents,"
5939,Henry VI Part 1,11,5.4.45,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Corrupt and tainted with a thousand vices,"
5940,Henry VI Part 1,11,5.4.46,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Because you want the grace that others have,"
5941,Henry VI Part 1,11,5.4.47,JOAN LA PUCELLE,You judge it straight a thing impossible
5942,Henry VI Part 1,11,5.4.48,JOAN LA PUCELLE,To compass wonders but by help of devils.
5943,Henry VI Part 1,11,5.4.49,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"No, misconceived! Joan of Arc hath been"
5944,Henry VI Part 1,11,5.4.50,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"A virgin from her tender infancy,"
5945,Henry VI Part 1,11,5.4.51,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Chaste and immaculate in very thought,"
5946,Henry VI Part 1,11,5.4.52,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Whose maiden blood, thus rigorously effused,"
5947,Henry VI Part 1,11,5.4.53,JOAN LA PUCELLE,Will cry for vengeance at the gates of heaven.
5948,Henry VI Part 1,12,5.4.54,YORK,"Ay, ay: away with her to execution!"
5949,Henry VI Part 1,13,5.4.55,WARWICK,"And hark ye, sirs, because she is a maid,"
5950,Henry VI Part 1,13,5.4.56,WARWICK,"Spare for no faggots, let there be enow:"
5951,Henry VI Part 1,13,5.4.57,WARWICK,"Place barrels of pitch upon the fatal stake,"
5952,Henry VI Part 1,13,5.4.58,WARWICK,That so her torture may be shortened.
5953,Henry VI Part 1,14,5.4.59,JOAN LA PUCELLE,Will nothing turn your unrelenting hearts?
5954,Henry VI Part 1,14,5.4.60,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Then, Joan, discover thine infirmity,"
5955,Henry VI Part 1,14,5.4.61,JOAN LA PUCELLE,That warranteth by law to be thy privilege.
5956,Henry VI Part 1,14,5.4.62,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"I am with child, ye bloody homicides:"
5957,Henry VI Part 1,14,5.4.63,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Murder not then the fruit within my womb,"
5958,Henry VI Part 1,14,5.4.64,JOAN LA PUCELLE,Although ye hale me to a violent death.
5959,Henry VI Part 1,15,5.4.65,YORK,Now heaven forfend! the holy maid with child!
5960,Henry VI Part 1,16,5.4.66,WARWICK,The greatest miracle that e'er ye wrought:
5961,Henry VI Part 1,16,5.4.67,WARWICK,Is all your strict preciseness come to this?
5962,Henry VI Part 1,17,5.4.68,YORK,She and the Dauphin have been juggling:
5963,Henry VI Part 1,17,5.4.69,YORK,I did imagine what would be her refuge.
5964,Henry VI Part 1,18,5.4.70,WARWICK,"Well, go to, we'll have no bastards live,"
5965,Henry VI Part 1,18,5.4.71,WARWICK,Especially since Charles must father it.
5966,Henry VI Part 1,19,5.4.72,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"You are deceived, my child is none of his:"
5967,Henry VI Part 1,19,5.4.73,JOAN LA PUCELLE,It was Alencon that enjoy'd my love.
5968,Henry VI Part 1,20,5.4.74,YORK,Alencon! that notorious Machiavel!
5969,Henry VI Part 1,20,5.4.75,YORK,"It dies, an if it had a thousand lives."
5970,Henry VI Part 1,21,5.4.76,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"O, give me leave, I have deluded you:"
5971,Henry VI Part 1,21,5.4.77,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"'Twas neither Charles nor yet the duke I named,"
5972,Henry VI Part 1,21,5.4.78,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"But Reignier, king of Naples, that prevail'd."
5973,Henry VI Part 1,22,5.4.79,WARWICK,A married man! that's most intolerable.
5974,Henry VI Part 1,23,5.4.80,YORK,"Why, here's a girl! I think she knows not well,"
5975,Henry VI Part 1,23,5.4.81,YORK,"There were so many, whom she may accuse."
5976,Henry VI Part 1,24,5.4.82,WARWICK,It's sign she hath been liberal and free.
5977,Henry VI Part 1,25,5.4.83,YORK,"And yet, forsooth, she is a virgin pure."
5978,Henry VI Part 1,25,5.4.84,YORK,"Strumpet, thy words condemn thy brat and thee:"
5979,Henry VI Part 1,25,5.4.85,YORK,"Use no entreaty, for it is in vain."
5980,Henry VI Part 1,26,5.4.86,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Then lead me hence, with whom I leave my curse:"
5981,Henry VI Part 1,26,5.4.87,JOAN LA PUCELLE,May never glorious sun reflex his beams
5982,Henry VI Part 1,26,5.4.88,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Upon the country where you make abode,"
5983,Henry VI Part 1,26,5.4.89,JOAN LA PUCELLE,But darkness and the gloomy shade of death
5984,Henry VI Part 1,26,5.4.90,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Environ you, till mischief and despair"
5985,Henry VI Part 1,26,5.4.91,JOAN LA PUCELLE,Drive you to break your necks or hang yourselves!
5986,Henry VI Part 1,26,,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Exit, guarded"
5987,Henry VI Part 1,27,5.4.92,YORK,"Break thou in pieces and consume to ashes,"
5988,Henry VI Part 1,27,5.4.93,YORK,Thou foul accursed minister of hell!
5989,Henry VI Part 1,27,,YORK,"Enter CARDINAL OF WINCHESTER, attended"

5998,Henry VI Part 1,28,5.4.102,OF WINCHESTER,"Approacheth, to confer about some matter."
5999,Henry VI Part 1,29,5.4.103,YORK,Is all our travail turn'd to this effect?
6000,Henry VI Part 1,29,5.4.104,YORK,"After the slaughter of so many peers,"
6001,Henry VI Part 1,29,5.4.105,YORK,"So many captains, gentlemen and soldiers,"
6002,Henry VI Part 1,29,5.4.106,YORK,That in this quarrel have been overthrown
6003,Henry VI Part 1,29,5.4.107,YORK,"And sold their bodies for their country's benefit,"
6004,Henry VI Part 1,29,5.4.108,YORK,Shall we at last conclude effeminate peace?
6005,Henry VI Part 1,29,5.4.109,YORK,"Have we not lost most part of all the towns,"
6006,Henry VI Part 1,29,5.4.110,YORK,"By treason, falsehood and by treachery,"
6007,Henry VI Part 1,29,5.4.111,YORK,Our great progenitors had conquered?
6008,Henry VI Part 1,29,5.4.112,YORK,"O Warwick, Warwick! I foresee with grief"
6009,Henry VI Part 1,29,5.4.113,YORK,The utter loss of all the realm of France.
6010,Henry VI Part 1,30,5.4.114,WARWICK,"Be patient, York: if we conclude a peace,"
6011,Henry VI Part 1,30,5.4.115,WARWICK,It shall be with such strict and severe covenants
6012,Henry VI Part 1,30,5.4.116,WARWICK,As little shall the Frenchmen gain thereby.
6013,Henry VI Part 1,30,,WARWICK,"Enter CHARLES, ALENCON, BASTARD OF ORLEANS, REIGNIER, and others"

6024,Henry VI Part 1,33,5.4.127,OF WINCHESTER,"Of mere compassion and of lenity,"

6032,Henry VI Part 1,34,5.4.135,ALENCON,Must he be then as shadow of himself?
6033,Henry VI Part 1,34,5.4.136,ALENCON,"Adorn his temples with a coronet,"
6034,Henry VI Part 1,34,5.4.137,ALENCON,"And yet, in substance and authority,"
6035,Henry VI Part 1,34,5.4.138,ALENCON,Retain but privilege of a private man?
6036,Henry VI Part 1,34,5.4.139,ALENCON,This proffer is absurd and reasonless.
6037,Henry VI Part 1,35,5.4.140,CHARLES,'Tis known already that I am possess'd
6038,Henry VI Part 1,35,5.4.141,CHARLES,"With more than half the Gallian territories,"

6040,Henry VI Part 1,35,5.4.143,CHARLES,"Shall I, for lucre of the rest unvanquish'd,"
6041,Henry VI Part 1,35,5.4.144,CHARLES,"Detract so much from that prerogative,"
6042,Henry VI Part 1,35,5.4.145,CHARLES,As to be call'd but viceroy of the whole?
6043,Henry VI Part 1,35,5.4.146,CHARLES,"No, lord ambassador, I'll rather keep"
6044,Henry VI Part 1,35,5.4.147,CHARLES,"That which I have than, coveting for more,"
6045,Henry VI Part 1,35,5.4.148,CHARLES,Be cast from possibility of all.
6046,Henry VI Part 1,36,5.4.149,YORK,Insulting Charles! hast thou by secret means
6047,Henry VI Part 1,36,5.4.150,YORK,"Used intercession to obtain a league,"
6048,Henry VI Part 1,36,5.4.151,YORK,"And, now the matter grows to compromise,"
6049,Henry VI Part 1,36,5.4.152,YORK,Stand'st thou aloof upon comparison?
6050,Henry VI Part 1,36,5.4.153,YORK,"Either accept the title thou usurp'st,"
6051,Henry VI Part 1,36,5.4.154,YORK,Of benefit proceeding from our king
6052,Henry VI Part 1,36,5.4.155,YORK,"And not of any challenge of desert,"
6053,Henry VI Part 1,36,5.4.156,YORK,Or we will plague thee with incessant wars.
6054,Henry VI Part 1,37,5.4.157,REIGNIER,"My lord, you do not well in obstinacy"
6055,Henry VI Part 1,37,5.4.158,REIGNIER,To cavil in the course of this contract:
6056,Henry VI Part 1,37,5.4.159,REIGNIER,"If once it be neglected, ten to one"
6057,Henry VI Part 1,37,5.4.160,REIGNIER,We shall not find like opportunity.
6058,Henry VI Part 1,38,5.4.161,ALENCON,"To say the truth, it is your policy"
6059,Henry VI Part 1,38,5.4.162,ALENCON,To save your subjects from such massacre
6060,Henry VI Part 1,38,5.4.163,ALENCON,And ruthless slaughters as are daily seen
6061,Henry VI Part 1,38,5.4.164,ALENCON,"By our proceeding in hostility,"
6062,Henry VI Part 1,38,5.4.165,ALENCON,"And therefore take this compact of a truce,"
6063,Henry VI Part 1,38,5.4.166,ALENCON,Although you break it when your pleasure serves.
6064,Henry VI Part 1,39,5.4.167,WARWICK,"How say'st thou, Charles? shall our condition stand?"
6065,Henry VI Part 1,40,5.4.168,CHARLES,"It shall,"

6070,Henry VI Part 1,41,5.4.173,YORK,"Nor be rebellious to the crown of England,"

6072,Henry VI Part 1,41,5.4.175,YORK,"So, now dismiss your army when ye please:"
6073,Henry VI Part 1,41,5.4.176,YORK,"Hang up your ensign, let your drums be still,"
6074,Henry VI Part 1,41,5.4.177,YORK,For here we entertain a solemn peace.

6076,Henry VI Part 1,41,,YORK,SCENE V. London. The palace.
6077,Henry VI Part 1,41,,YORK,"Enter SUFFOLK in conference with KING HENRY VI, GLOUCESTER and EXETER"
6078,Henry VI Part 1,1,5.5.1,KING HENRY VI,"Your wondrous rare description, noble earl,"
6079,Henry VI Part 1,1,5.5.2,KING HENRY VI,Of beauteous Margaret hath astonish'd me:
6080,Henry VI Part 1,1,5.5.3,KING HENRY VI,Her virtues graced with external gifts
6081,Henry VI Part 1,1,5.5.4,KING HENRY VI,Do breed love's settled passions in my heart:
6082,Henry VI Part 1,1,5.5.5,KING HENRY VI,And like as rigor of tempestuous gusts
6083,Henry VI Part 1,1,5.5.6,KING HENRY VI,"Provokes the mightiest hulk against the tide,"
6084,Henry VI Part 1,1,5.5.7,KING HENRY VI,So am I driven by breath of her renown
6085,Henry VI Part 1,1,5.5.8,KING HENRY VI,Either to suffer shipwreck or arrive
6086,Henry VI Part 1,1,5.5.9,KING HENRY VI,Where I may have fruition of her love.
6087,Henry VI Part 1,2,5.5.10,SUFFOLK,"Tush, my good lord, this superficial tale"
6088,Henry VI Part 1,2,5.5.11,SUFFOLK,"Is but a preface of her worthy praise,"
6089,Henry VI Part 1,2,5.5.12,SUFFOLK,The chief perfections of that lovely dame
6090,Henry VI Part 1,2,5.5.13,SUFFOLK,"Had I sufficient skill to utter them,"
6091,Henry VI Part 1,2,5.5.14,SUFFOLK,"Would make a volume of enticing lines,"
6092,Henry VI Part 1,2,5.5.15,SUFFOLK,Able to ravish any dull conceit:
6093,Henry VI Part 1,2,5.5.16,SUFFOLK,"And, which is more, she is not so divine,"
6094,Henry VI Part 1,2,5.5.17,SUFFOLK,"So full-replete with choice of all delights,"
6095,Henry VI Part 1,2,5.5.18,SUFFOLK,But with as humble lowliness of mind
6096,Henry VI Part 1,2,5.5.19,SUFFOLK,"She is content to be at your command,"
6097,Henry VI Part 1,2,5.5.20,SUFFOLK,"Command, I mean, of virtuous chaste intents,"
6098,Henry VI Part 1,2,5.5.21,SUFFOLK,To love and honour Henry as her lord.
6099,Henry VI Part 1,3,5.5.22,KING HENRY VI,And otherwise will Henry ne'er presume.
6100,Henry VI Part 1,3,5.5.23,KING HENRY VI,"Therefore, my lord protector, give consent"
6101,Henry VI Part 1,3,5.5.24,KING HENRY VI,That Margaret may be England's royal queen.
6102,Henry VI Part 1,4,5.5.25,GLOUCESTER,So should I give consent to flatter sin.
6103,Henry VI Part 1,4,5.5.26,GLOUCESTER,"You know, my lord, your highness is betroth'd"
6104,Henry VI Part 1,4,5.5.27,GLOUCESTER,Unto another lady of esteem:
6105,Henry VI Part 1,4,5.5.28,GLOUCESTER,"How shall we then dispense with that contract,"
6106,Henry VI Part 1,4,5.5.29,GLOUCESTER,And not deface your honour with reproach?
6107,Henry VI Part 1,5,5.5.30,SUFFOLK,"As doth a ruler with unlawful oaths,"
6108,Henry VI Part 1,5,5.5.31,SUFFOLK,"Or one that, at a triumph having vow'd"
6109,Henry VI Part 1,5,5.5.32,SUFFOLK,"To try his strength, forsaketh yet the lists"
6110,Henry VI Part 1,5,5.5.33,SUFFOLK,By reason of his adversary's odds:
6111,Henry VI Part 1,5,5.5.34,SUFFOLK,"A poor earl's daughter is unequal odds,"
6112,Henry VI Part 1,5,5.5.35,SUFFOLK,And therefore may be broke without offence.
6113,Henry VI Part 1,6,5.5.36,GLOUCESTER,"Why, what, I pray, is Margaret more than that?"
6114,Henry VI Part 1,6,5.5.37,GLOUCESTER,"Her father is no better than an earl,"
6115,Henry VI Part 1,6,5.5.38,GLOUCESTER,Although in glorious titles he excel.
6116,Henry VI Part 1,7,5.5.39,SUFFOLK,"Yes, lord, her father is a king,"
6117,Henry VI Part 1,7,5.5.40,SUFFOLK,"The King of Naples and Jerusalem,"
6118,Henry VI Part 1,7,5.5.41,SUFFOLK,And of such great authority in France
6119,Henry VI Part 1,7,5.5.42,SUFFOLK,As his alliance will confirm our peace
6120,Henry VI Part 1,7,5.5.43,SUFFOLK,And keep the Frenchmen in allegiance.
6121,Henry VI Part 1,8,5.5.44,GLOUCESTER,"And so the Earl of Armagnac may do,"
6122,Henry VI Part 1,8,5.5.45,GLOUCESTER,Because he is near kinsman unto Charles.
6123,Henry VI Part 1,9,5.5.46,EXETER,"Beside, his wealth doth warrant a liberal dower,"
6124,Henry VI Part 1,9,5.5.47,EXETER,Where Reignier sooner will receive than give.
6125,Henry VI Part 1,10,5.5.48,SUFFOLK,"A dower, my lords! disgrace not so your king,"
6126,Henry VI Part 1,10,5.5.49,SUFFOLK,"That he should be so abject, base and poor,"
6127,Henry VI Part 1,10,5.5.50,SUFFOLK,To choose for wealth and not for perfect love.
6128,Henry VI Part 1,10,5.5.51,SUFFOLK,Henry is able to enrich his queen
6129,Henry VI Part 1,10,5.5.52,SUFFOLK,And not seek a queen to make him rich:
6130,Henry VI Part 1,10,5.5.53,SUFFOLK,"So worthless peasants bargain for their wives,"
6131,Henry VI Part 1,10,5.5.54,SUFFOLK,"As market-men for oxen, sheep, or horse."
6132,Henry VI Part 1,10,5.5.55,SUFFOLK,Marriage is a matter of more worth
6133,Henry VI Part 1,10,5.5.56,SUFFOLK,"Than to be dealt in by attorneyship,"
6134,Henry VI Part 1,10,5.5.57,SUFFOLK,"Not whom we will, but whom his grace affects,"
6135,Henry VI Part 1,10,5.5.58,SUFFOLK,Must be companion of his nuptial bed:
6136,Henry VI Part 1,10,5.5.59,SUFFOLK,"And therefore, lords, since he affects her most,"
6137,Henry VI Part 1,10,5.5.60,SUFFOLK,"It most of all these reasons bindeth us,"
6138,Henry VI Part 1,10,5.5.61,SUFFOLK,In our opinions she should be preferr'd.
6139,Henry VI Part 1,10,5.5.62,SUFFOLK,"For what is wedlock forced but a hell,"
6140,Henry VI Part 1,10,5.5.63,SUFFOLK,An age of discord and continual strife?
6141,Henry VI Part 1,10,5.5.64,SUFFOLK,"Whereas the contrary bringeth bliss,"
6142,Henry VI Part 1,10,5.5.65,SUFFOLK,And is a pattern of celestial peace.
6143,Henry VI Part 1,10,5.5.66,SUFFOLK,"Whom should we match with Henry, being a king,"
6144,Henry VI Part 1,10,5.5.67,SUFFOLK,"But Margaret, that is daughter to a king?"
6145,Henry VI Part 1,10,5.5.68,SUFFOLK,"Her peerless feature, joined with her birth,"
6146,Henry VI Part 1,10,5.5.69,SUFFOLK,Approves her fit for none but for a king:
6147,Henry VI Part 1,10,5.5.70,SUFFOLK,"Her valiant courage and undaunted spirit,"
6148,Henry VI Part 1,10,5.5.71,SUFFOLK,"More than in women commonly is seen,"
6149,Henry VI Part 1,10,5.5.72,SUFFOLK,"Will answer our hope in issue of a king,"
6150,Henry VI Part 1,10,5.5.73,SUFFOLK,"For Henry, son unto a conqueror,"
6151,Henry VI Part 1,10,5.5.74,SUFFOLK,"Is likely to beget more conquerors,"
6152,Henry VI Part 1,10,5.5.75,SUFFOLK,If with a lady of so high resolve
6153,Henry VI Part 1,10,5.5.76,SUFFOLK,As is fair Margaret he be link'd in love.
6154,Henry VI Part 1,10,5.5.77,SUFFOLK,"Then yield, my lords, and here conclude with me"
6155,Henry VI Part 1,10,5.5.78,SUFFOLK,"That Margaret shall be queen, and none but she."
6156,Henry VI Part 1,11,5.5.79,KING HENRY VI,"Whether it be through force of your report,"
6157,Henry VI Part 1,11,5.5.80,KING HENRY VI,"My noble Lord of Suffolk, or for that"
6158,Henry VI Part 1,11,5.5.81,KING HENRY VI,My tender youth was never yet attaint
6159,Henry VI Part 1,11,5.5.82,KING HENRY VI,"With any passion of inflaming love,"
6160,Henry VI Part 1,11,5.5.83,KING HENRY VI,"I cannot tell, but this I am assured,"
6161,Henry VI Part 1,11,5.5.84,KING HENRY VI,"I feel such sharp dissension in my breast,"
6162,Henry VI Part 1,11,5.5.85,KING HENRY VI,"Such fierce alarums both of hope and fear,"
6163,Henry VI Part 1,11,5.5.86,KING HENRY VI,As I am sick with working of my thoughts.
6164,Henry VI Part 1,11,5.5.87,KING HENRY VI,"Take, therefore, shipping, post, my lord, to France,"
6165,Henry VI Part 1,11,5.5.88,KING HENRY VI,"Agree to any covenants, and procure"
6166,Henry VI Part 1,11,5.5.89,KING HENRY VI,That Lady Margaret do vouchsafe to come
6167,Henry VI Part 1,11,5.5.90,KING HENRY VI,To cross the seas to England and be crown'd
6168,Henry VI Part 1,11,5.5.91,KING HENRY VI,King Henry's faithful and anointed queen:
6169,Henry VI Part 1,11,5.5.92,KING HENRY VI,"For your expenses and sufficient charge,"
6170,Henry VI Part 1,11,5.5.93,KING HENRY VI,Among the people gather up a tenth.
6171,Henry VI Part 1,11,5.5.94,KING HENRY VI,"Be gone, I say, for, till you do return,"
6172,Henry VI Part 1,11,5.5.95,KING HENRY VI,I rest perplexed with a thousand cares.
6173,Henry VI Part 1,11,5.5.96,KING HENRY VI,"And you, good uncle, banish all offence:"
6174,Henry VI Part 1,11,5.5.97,KING HENRY VI,"If you do censure me by what you were,"
6175,Henry VI Part 1,11,5.5.98,KING HENRY VI,"Not what you are, I know it will excuse"
6176,Henry VI Part 1,11,5.5.99,KING HENRY VI,This sudden execution of my will.
6177,Henry VI Part 1,11,5.5.100,KING HENRY VI,"And so, conduct me where, from company,"
6178,Henry VI Part 1,11,5.5.101,KING HENRY VI,I may revolve and ruminate my grief.
6179,Henry VI Part 1,11,,KING HENRY VI,Exit
6180,Henry VI Part 1,12,5.5.102,GLOUCESTER,"Ay, grief, I fear me, both at first and last."
6181,Henry VI Part 1,12,,GLOUCESTER,Exeunt GLOUCESTER and EXETER

6328,Henry VI Part 2,20,1.1.134,GLOUCESTER,For costs and charges in transporting her!
6329,Henry VI Part 2,20,1.1.135,GLOUCESTER,She should have stayed in France and starved

6420,Henry VI Part 2,33,1.1.222,YORK,"'Tis thine they give away, and not their own."
6421,Henry VI Part 2,33,1.1.223,YORK,Pirates may make cheap pennyworths of their pillage

6432,Henry VI Part 2,33,1.1.234,YORK,Bear that proportion to my flesh and blood

6435,Henry VI Part 2,33,1.1.237,YORK,Anjou and Maine both given unto the French!

6457,Henry VI Part 2,33,1.1.259,YORK,"And, force perforce, I'll make him yield the crown,"
6458,Henry VI Part 2,33,1.1.260,YORK,Whose bookish rule hath pull'd fair England down.
6459,Henry VI Part 2,33,,YORK,Exit
6460,Henry VI Part 2,33,,YORK,SCENE II. GLOUCESTER'S house.
6461,Henry VI Part 2,33,,YORK,Enter GLOUCESTER and his DUCHESS
6462,Henry VI Part 2,1,1.2.1,DUCHESS,"Why droops my lord, like over-ripen'd corn,"
6463,Henry VI Part 2,1,1.2.2,DUCHESS,Hanging the head at Ceres' plenteous load?
6464,Henry VI Part 2,1,1.2.3,DUCHESS,"Why doth the great Duke Humphrey knit his brows,"
6465,Henry VI Part 2,1,1.2.4,DUCHESS,As frowning at the favours of the world?
6466,Henry VI Part 2,1,1.2.5,DUCHESS,"Why are thine eyes fixed to the sullen earth,"
6467,Henry VI Part 2,1,1.2.6,DUCHESS,Gazing on that which seems to dim thy sight?
6468,Henry VI Part 2,1,1.2.7,DUCHESS,"What seest thou there? King Henry's diadem,"
6469,Henry VI Part 2,1,1.2.8,DUCHESS,Enchased with all the honours of the world?
6470,Henry VI Part 2,1,1.2.9,DUCHESS,"If so, gaze on, and grovel on thy face,"
6471,Henry VI Part 2,1,1.2.10,DUCHESS,Until thy head be circled with the same.
6472,Henry VI Part 2,1,1.2.11,DUCHESS,"Put forth thy hand, reach at the glorious gold."
6473,Henry VI Part 2,1,1.2.12,DUCHESS,"What, is't too short? I'll lengthen it with mine:"
6474,Henry VI Part 2,1,1.2.13,DUCHESS,"And, having both together heaved it up,"
6475,Henry VI Part 2,1,1.2.14,DUCHESS,"We'll both together lift our heads to heaven,"
6476,Henry VI Part 2,1,1.2.15,DUCHESS,And never more abase our sight so low
6477,Henry VI Part 2,1,1.2.16,DUCHESS,As to vouchsafe one glance unto the ground.
6478,Henry VI Part 2,2,1.2.17,GLOUCESTER,"O Nell, sweet Nell, if thou dost love thy lord,"
6479,Henry VI Part 2,2,1.2.18,GLOUCESTER,Banish the canker of ambitious thoughts.
6480,Henry VI Part 2,2,1.2.19,GLOUCESTER,"And may that thought, when I imagine ill"
6481,Henry VI Part 2,2,1.2.20,GLOUCESTER,"Against my king and nephew, virtuous Henry,"
6482,Henry VI Part 2,2,1.2.21,GLOUCESTER,Be my last breathing in this mortal world!
6483,Henry VI Part 2,2,1.2.22,GLOUCESTER,My troublous dream this night doth make me sad.
6484,Henry VI Part 2,3,1.2.23,DUCHESS,"What dream'd my lord? tell me, and I'll requite it"
6485,Henry VI Part 2,3,1.2.24,DUCHESS,With sweet rehearsal of my morning's dream.
6486,Henry VI Part 2,4,1.2.25,GLOUCESTER,"Methought this staff, mine office-badge in court,"
6487,Henry VI Part 2,4,1.2.26,GLOUCESTER,"Was broke in twain, by whom I have forgot,"
6488,Henry VI Part 2,4,1.2.27,GLOUCESTER,"But, as I think, it was by the cardinal,"
6489,Henry VI Part 2,4,1.2.28,GLOUCESTER,And on the pieces of the broken wand
6490,Henry VI Part 2,4,1.2.29,GLOUCESTER,"Were placed the heads of Edmund Duke of Somerset,"
6491,Henry VI Part 2,4,1.2.30,GLOUCESTER,"And William de la Pole, first duke of Suffolk."
6492,Henry VI Part 2,4,1.2.31,GLOUCESTER,"This was my dream: what it doth bode, God knows."
6493,Henry VI Part 2,5,1.2.32,DUCHESS,"Tut, this was nothing but an argument"
6494,Henry VI Part 2,5,1.2.33,DUCHESS,That he that breaks a stick of Gloucester's grove
6495,Henry VI Part 2,5,1.2.34,DUCHESS,Shall lose his head for his presumption.
6496,Henry VI Part 2,5,1.2.35,DUCHESS,"But list to me, my Humphrey, my sweet duke:"
6497,Henry VI Part 2,5,1.2.36,DUCHESS,Methought I sat in seat of majesty
6498,Henry VI Part 2,5,1.2.37,DUCHESS,"In the cathedral church of Westminster,"
6499,Henry VI Part 2,5,1.2.38,DUCHESS,"And in that chair where kings and queens are crown'd,"
6500,Henry VI Part 2,5,1.2.39,DUCHESS,Where Henry and dame Margaret kneel'd to me
6501,Henry VI Part 2,5,1.2.40,DUCHESS,And on my head did set the diadem.
6502,Henry VI Part 2,6,1.2.41,GLOUCESTER,"Nay, Eleanor, then must I chide outright:"
6503,Henry VI Part 2,6,1.2.42,GLOUCESTER,"Presumptuous dame, ill-nurtured Eleanor,"
6504,Henry VI Part 2,6,1.2.43,GLOUCESTER,"Art thou not second woman in the realm,"
6505,Henry VI Part 2,6,1.2.44,GLOUCESTER,"And the protector's wife, beloved of him?"
6506,Henry VI Part 2,6,1.2.45,GLOUCESTER,"Hast thou not worldly pleasure at command,"
6507,Henry VI Part 2,6,1.2.46,GLOUCESTER,Above the reach or compass of thy thought?
6508,Henry VI Part 2,6,1.2.47,GLOUCESTER,"And wilt thou still be hammering treachery,"
6509,Henry VI Part 2,6,1.2.48,GLOUCESTER,To tumble down thy husband and thyself
6510,Henry VI Part 2,6,1.2.49,GLOUCESTER,From top of honour to disgrace's feet?
6511,Henry VI Part 2,6,1.2.50,GLOUCESTER,"Away from me, and let me hear no more!"
6512,Henry VI Part 2,7,1.2.51,DUCHESS,"What, what, my lord! are you so choleric"
6513,Henry VI Part 2,7,1.2.52,DUCHESS,"With Eleanor, for telling but her dream?"
6514,Henry VI Part 2,7,1.2.53,DUCHESS,"Next time I'll keep my dreams unto myself,"
6515,Henry VI Part 2,7,1.2.54,DUCHESS,And not be cheque'd.
6516,Henry VI Part 2,8,1.2.55,GLOUCESTER,"Nay, be not angry, I am pleased again."
6517,Henry VI Part 2,8,,GLOUCESTER,Enter Messenger
6518,Henry VI Part 2,9,1.2.56,Messenger,"My lord protector, 'tis his highness' pleasure"
6519,Henry VI Part 2,9,1.2.57,Messenger,"You do prepare to ride unto Saint Alban's,"
6520,Henry VI Part 2,9,1.2.58,Messenger,Where as the king and queen do mean to hawk.
6521,Henry VI Part 2,10,1.2.59,GLOUCESTER,"I go. Come, Nell, thou wilt ride with us?"
6522,Henry VI Part 2,11,1.2.60,DUCHESS,"Yes, my good lord, I'll follow presently."
6523,Henry VI Part 2,11,,DUCHESS,Exeunt GLOUCESTER and Messenger
6524,Henry VI Part 2,11,1.2.61,DUCHESS,"Follow I must, I cannot go before,"
6525,Henry VI Part 2,11,1.2.62,DUCHESS,While Gloucester bears this base and humble mind.
6526,Henry VI Part 2,11,1.2.63,DUCHESS,"Were I a man, a duke, and next of blood,"
6527,Henry VI Part 2,11,1.2.64,DUCHESS,I would remove these tedious stumbling-blocks
6528,Henry VI Part 2,11,1.2.65,DUCHESS,"And smooth my way upon their headless necks,"
6529,Henry VI Part 2,11,1.2.66,DUCHESS,"And, being a woman, I will not be slack"
6530,Henry VI Part 2,11,1.2.67,DUCHESS,To play my part in Fortune's pageant.
6531,Henry VI Part 2,11,1.2.68,DUCHESS,"Where are you there? Sir John! nay, fear not, man,"
6532,Henry VI Part 2,11,1.2.69,DUCHESS,"We are alone, here's none but thee and I."
6533,Henry VI Part 2,11,,DUCHESS,Enter HUME
6534,Henry VI Part 2,12,1.2.70,HUME,Jesus preserve your royal majesty!
6535,Henry VI Part 2,13,1.2.71,DUCHESS,What say'st thou? majesty! I am but grace.
6536,Henry VI Part 2,14,1.2.72,HUME,"But, by the grace of God, and Hume's advice,"
6537,Henry VI Part 2,14,1.2.73,HUME,Your grace's title shall be multiplied.
6538,Henry VI Part 2,15,1.2.74,DUCHESS,"What say'st thou, man? hast thou as yet conferr'd"
6539,Henry VI Part 2,15,1.2.75,DUCHESS,"With Margery Jourdain, the cunning witch,"
6540,Henry VI Part 2,15,1.2.76,DUCHESS,"With Roger Bolingbroke, the conjurer?"
6541,Henry VI Part 2,15,1.2.77,DUCHESS,And will they undertake to do me good?
6542,Henry VI Part 2,16,1.2.78,HUME,"This they have promised, to show your highness"
6543,Henry VI Part 2,16,1.2.79,HUME,"A spirit raised from depth of under-ground,"
6544,Henry VI Part 2,16,1.2.80,HUME,That shall make answer to such questions
6545,Henry VI Part 2,16,1.2.81,HUME,As by your grace shall be propounded him.
6546,Henry VI Part 2,17,1.2.82,DUCHESS,"It is enough, I'll think upon the questions:"
6547,Henry VI Part 2,17,1.2.83,DUCHESS,"When from St. Alban's we do make return,"
6548,Henry VI Part 2,17,1.2.84,DUCHESS,We'll see these things effected to the full.
6549,Henry VI Part 2,17,1.2.85,DUCHESS,"Here, Hume, take this reward, make merry, man,"
6550,Henry VI Part 2,17,1.2.86,DUCHESS,With thy confederates in this weighty cause.
6551,Henry VI Part 2,17,,DUCHESS,Exit
6552,Henry VI Part 2,18,1.2.87,HUME,"Hume must make merry with the duchess' gold,"
6553,Henry VI Part 2,18,1.2.88,HUME,"Marry, and shall. But how now, Sir John Hume!"
6554,Henry VI Part 2,18,1.2.89,HUME,"Seal up your lips, and give no words but mum:"
6555,Henry VI Part 2,18,1.2.90,HUME,The business asketh silent secrecy.
6556,Henry VI Part 2,18,1.2.91,HUME,Dame Eleanor gives gold to bring the witch:
6557,Henry VI Part 2,18,1.2.92,HUME,"Gold cannot come amiss, were she a devil."
6558,Henry VI Part 2,18,1.2.93,HUME,"Yet have I gold flies from another coast,"
6559,Henry VI Part 2,18,1.2.94,HUME,"I dare not say, from the rich cardinal"
6560,Henry VI Part 2,18,1.2.95,HUME,"And from the great and new-made Duke of Suffolk,"
6561,Henry VI Part 2,18,1.2.96,HUME,"Yet I do find it so, for to be plain,"
6562,Henry VI Part 2,18,1.2.97,HUME,"They, knowing Dame Eleanor's aspiring humour,"
6563,Henry VI Part 2,18,1.2.98,HUME,Have hired me to undermine the duchess
6564,Henry VI Part 2,18,1.2.99,HUME,And buz these conjurations in her brain.
6565,Henry VI Part 2,18,1.2.100,HUME,"They say 'A crafty knave does need no broker,'"
6566,Henry VI Part 2,18,1.2.101,HUME,Yet am I Suffolk and the cardinal's broker.
6567,Henry VI Part 2,18,1.2.102,HUME,"Hume, if you take not heed, you shall go near"
6568,Henry VI Part 2,18,1.2.103,HUME,To call them both a pair of crafty knaves.
6569,Henry VI Part 2,18,1.2.104,HUME,"Well, so it stands, and thus, I fear, at last"
6570,Henry VI Part 2,18,1.2.105,HUME,"Hume's knavery will be the duchess' wreck,"
6571,Henry VI Part 2,18,1.2.106,HUME,And her attainture will be Humphrey's fall:
6572,Henry VI Part 2,18,1.2.107,HUME,"Sort how it will, I shall have gold for all."
6573,Henry VI Part 2,18,,HUME,Exit
6574,Henry VI Part 2,18,,HUME,SCENE III. The palace.
6575,Henry VI Part 2,18,,HUME,"Enter three or four Petitioners, PETER, the Armourer's man, being one"
6576,Henry VI Part 2,1,1.3.1,First Petitioner,"My masters, let's stand close: my lord protector"
6577,Henry VI Part 2,1,1.3.2,First Petitioner,"will come this way by and by, and then we may deliver"
6578,Henry VI Part 2,1,1.3.3,First Petitioner,our supplications in the quill.
6579,Henry VI Part 2,2,1.3.4,Second Petitioner,"Marry, the Lord protect him, for he's a good man!"
6580,Henry VI Part 2,2,1.3.5,Second Petitioner,Jesu bless him!
6581,Henry VI Part 2,2,,Second Petitioner,Enter SUFFOLK and QUEEN MARGARET
6582,Henry VI Part 2,3,1.3.6,PETER,"Here a' comes, methinks, and the queen with him."
6583,Henry VI Part 2,3,1.3.7,PETER,"I'll be the first, sure."
6584,Henry VI Part 2,4,1.3.8,Second Petitioner,"Come back, fool, this is the Duke of Suffolk, and"
6585,Henry VI Part 2,4,1.3.9,Second Petitioner,not my lord protector.
6586,Henry VI Part 2,5,1.3.10,SUFFOLK,"How now, fellow! would'st anything with me?"
6587,Henry VI Part 2,6,1.3.11,First Petitioner,"I pray, my lord, pardon me, I took ye for my lord"
6588,Henry VI Part 2,6,1.3.12,First Petitioner,protector.
6589,Henry VI Part 2,7,1.3.13,QUEEN MARGARET,[Reading]  'To my Lord Protector!' Are your
6590,Henry VI Part 2,7,1.3.14,QUEEN MARGARET,supplications to his lordship? Let me see them:
6591,Henry VI Part 2,7,1.3.15,QUEEN MARGARET,what is thine?
6592,Henry VI Part 2,8,1.3.16,First Petitioner,"Mine is, an't please your grace, against John"
6593,Henry VI Part 2,8,1.3.17,First Petitioner,"Goodman, my lord cardinal's man, for keeping my"
6594,Henry VI Part 2,8,1.3.18,First Petitioner,"house, and lands, and wife and all, from me."
6595,Henry VI Part 2,9,1.3.19,SUFFOLK,"Thy wife, too! that's some wrong, indeed. What's"
6596,Henry VI Part 2,9,1.3.20,SUFFOLK,yours? What's here!
6597,Henry VI Part 2,9,,SUFFOLK,Reads
6598,Henry VI Part 2,9,1.3.21,SUFFOLK,"'Against the Duke of Suffolk, for enclosing the"

6600,Henry VI Part 2,10,1.3.23,Second Petitioner,"Alas, sir, I am but a poor petitioner of our whole township."
6601,Henry VI Part 2,11,1.3.24,PETER,"[Giving his petition]  Against my master, Thomas"
6602,Henry VI Part 2,11,1.3.25,PETER,"Horner, for saying that the Duke of York was rightful"
6603,Henry VI Part 2,11,1.3.26,PETER,heir to the crown.
6604,Henry VI Part 2,12,1.3.27,QUEEN MARGARET,What sayst thou? did the Duke of York say he was
6605,Henry VI Part 2,12,1.3.28,QUEEN MARGARET,rightful heir to the crown?
6606,Henry VI Part 2,13,1.3.29,PETER,"That my master was? no, forsooth: my master said"
6607,Henry VI Part 2,13,1.3.30,PETER,"that he was, and that the king was an usurper."
6608,Henry VI Part 2,14,1.3.31,SUFFOLK,Who is there?
6609,Henry VI Part 2,14,,SUFFOLK,Enter Servant
6610,Henry VI Part 2,14,1.3.32,SUFFOLK,"Take this fellow in, and send for"
6611,Henry VI Part 2,14,1.3.33,SUFFOLK,his master with a pursuivant presently: we'll hear
6612,Henry VI Part 2,14,1.3.34,SUFFOLK,more of your matter before the King.
6613,Henry VI Part 2,14,,SUFFOLK,Exit Servant with PETER
6614,Henry VI Part 2,15,1.3.35,QUEEN MARGARET,"And as for you, that love to be protected"
6615,Henry VI Part 2,15,1.3.36,QUEEN MARGARET,"Under the wings of our protector's grace,"
6616,Henry VI Part 2,15,1.3.37,QUEEN MARGARET,"Begin your suits anew, and sue to him."
6617,Henry VI Part 2,15,,QUEEN MARGARET,Tears the supplication
6618,Henry VI Part 2,15,1.3.38,QUEEN MARGARET,"Away, base cullions! Suffolk, let them go."
6619,Henry VI Part 2,16,1.3.39,ALL,"Come, let's be gone."
6620,Henry VI Part 2,16,,ALL,Exeunt
6621,Henry VI Part 2,17,1.3.40,QUEEN MARGARET,"My Lord of Suffolk, say, is this the guise,"
6622,Henry VI Part 2,17,1.3.41,QUEEN MARGARET,Is this the fashion in the court of England?
6623,Henry VI Part 2,17,1.3.42,QUEEN MARGARET,"Is this the government of Britain's isle,"
6624,Henry VI Part 2,17,1.3.43,QUEEN MARGARET,And this the royalty of Albion's king?
6625,Henry VI Part 2,17,1.3.44,QUEEN MARGARET,What shall King Henry be a pupil still
6626,Henry VI Part 2,17,1.3.45,QUEEN MARGARET,Under the surly Gloucester's governance?
6627,Henry VI Part 2,17,1.3.46,QUEEN MARGARET,"Am I a queen in title and in style,"
6628,Henry VI Part 2,17,1.3.47,QUEEN MARGARET,And must be made a subject to a duke?
6629,Henry VI Part 2,17,1.3.48,QUEEN MARGARET,"I tell thee, Pole, when in the city Tours"
6630,Henry VI Part 2,17,1.3.49,QUEEN MARGARET,Thou ran'st a tilt in honour of my love
6631,Henry VI Part 2,17,1.3.50,QUEEN MARGARET,"And stolest away the ladies' hearts of France,"
6632,Henry VI Part 2,17,1.3.51,QUEEN MARGARET,I thought King Henry had resembled thee
6633,Henry VI Part 2,17,1.3.52,QUEEN MARGARET,"In courage, courtship and proportion:"
6634,Henry VI Part 2,17,1.3.53,QUEEN MARGARET,"But all his mind is bent to holiness,"
6635,Henry VI Part 2,17,1.3.54,QUEEN MARGARET,"To number Ave-Maries on his beads,"
6636,Henry VI Part 2,17,1.3.55,QUEEN MARGARET,"His champions are the prophets and apostles,"
6637,Henry VI Part 2,17,1.3.56,QUEEN MARGARET,"His weapons holy saws of sacred writ,"
6638,Henry VI Part 2,17,1.3.57,QUEEN MARGARET,"His study is his tilt-yard, and his loves"
6639,Henry VI Part 2,17,1.3.58,QUEEN MARGARET,Are brazen images of canonized saints.
6640,Henry VI Part 2,17,1.3.59,QUEEN MARGARET,I would the college of the cardinals
6641,Henry VI Part 2,17,1.3.60,QUEEN MARGARET,"Would choose him pope, and carry him to Rome,"
6642,Henry VI Part 2,17,1.3.61,QUEEN MARGARET,And set the triple crown upon his head:
6643,Henry VI Part 2,17,1.3.62,QUEEN MARGARET,That were a state fit for his holiness.
6644,Henry VI Part 2,18,1.3.63,SUFFOLK,"Madam, be patient: as I was cause"
6645,Henry VI Part 2,18,1.3.64,SUFFOLK,"Your highness came to England, so will I"
6646,Henry VI Part 2,18,1.3.65,SUFFOLK,In England work your grace's full content.
6647,Henry VI Part 2,19,1.3.66,QUEEN MARGARET,"Beside the haughty protector, have we Beaufort,"
6648,Henry VI Part 2,19,1.3.67,QUEEN MARGARET,"The imperious churchman, Somerset, Buckingham,"
6649,Henry VI Part 2,19,1.3.68,QUEEN MARGARET,And grumbling York: and not the least of these
6650,Henry VI Part 2,19,1.3.69,QUEEN MARGARET,But can do more in England than the king.
6651,Henry VI Part 2,20,1.3.70,SUFFOLK,And he of these that can do most of all
6652,Henry VI Part 2,20,1.3.71,SUFFOLK,Cannot do more in England than the Nevils:
6653,Henry VI Part 2,20,1.3.72,SUFFOLK,Salisbury and Warwick are no simple peers.
6654,Henry VI Part 2,21,1.3.73,QUEEN MARGARET,Not all these lords do vex me half so much
6655,Henry VI Part 2,21,1.3.74,QUEEN MARGARET,"As that proud dame, the lord protector's wife."
6656,Henry VI Part 2,21,1.3.75,QUEEN MARGARET,"She sweeps it through the court with troops of ladies,"
6657,Henry VI Part 2,21,1.3.76,QUEEN MARGARET,More like an empress than Duke Humphrey's wife:
6658,Henry VI Part 2,21,1.3.77,QUEEN MARGARET,Strangers in court do take her for the queen:
6659,Henry VI Part 2,21,1.3.78,QUEEN MARGARET,"She bears a duke's revenues on her back,"
6660,Henry VI Part 2,21,1.3.79,QUEEN MARGARET,And in her heart she scorns our poverty:
6661,Henry VI Part 2,21,1.3.80,QUEEN MARGARET,Shall I not live to be avenged on her?
6662,Henry VI Part 2,21,1.3.81,QUEEN MARGARET,"Contemptuous base-born callet as she is,"
6663,Henry VI Part 2,21,1.3.82,QUEEN MARGARET,"She vaunted 'mongst her minions t'other day,"
6664,Henry VI Part 2,21,1.3.83,QUEEN MARGARET,The very train of her worst wearing gown
6665,Henry VI Part 2,21,1.3.84,QUEEN MARGARET,"Was better worth than all my father's lands,"
6666,Henry VI Part 2,21,1.3.85,QUEEN MARGARET,Till Suffolk gave two dukedoms for his daughter.
6667,Henry VI Part 2,22,1.3.86,SUFFOLK,"Madam, myself have limed a bush for her,"
6668,Henry VI Part 2,22,1.3.87,SUFFOLK,"And placed a quire of such enticing birds,"
6669,Henry VI Part 2,22,1.3.88,SUFFOLK,"That she will light to listen to the lays,"
6670,Henry VI Part 2,22,1.3.89,SUFFOLK,And never mount to trouble you again.
6671,Henry VI Part 2,22,1.3.90,SUFFOLK,"So, let her rest: and, madam, list to me,"
6672,Henry VI Part 2,22,1.3.91,SUFFOLK,For I am bold to counsel you in this.

6674,Henry VI Part 2,22,1.3.93,SUFFOLK,"Yet must we join with him and with the lords,"
6675,Henry VI Part 2,22,1.3.94,SUFFOLK,Till we have brought Duke Humphrey in disgrace.
6676,Henry VI Part 2,22,1.3.95,SUFFOLK,"As for the Duke of York, this late complaint"
6677,Henry VI Part 2,22,1.3.96,SUFFOLK,Will make but little for his benefit.
6678,Henry VI Part 2,22,1.3.97,SUFFOLK,"So, one by one, we'll weed them all at last,"
6679,Henry VI Part 2,22,1.3.98,SUFFOLK,And you yourself shall steer the happy helm.

6739,Henry VI Part 2,45,1.3.152,GLOUCESTER,I come to talk of commonwealth affairs.
6740,Henry VI Part 2,45,1.3.153,GLOUCESTER,"As for your spiteful false objections,"
6741,Henry VI Part 2,45,1.3.154,GLOUCESTER,"Prove them, and I lie open to the law:"

6749,Henry VI Part 2,46,1.3.162,SUFFOLK,That York is most unmeet of any man.
6750,Henry VI Part 2,47,1.3.163,YORK,"I'll tell thee, Suffolk, why I am unmeet:"
6751,Henry VI Part 2,47,1.3.164,YORK,"First, for I cannot flatter thee in pride,"
6752,Henry VI Part 2,47,1.3.165,YORK,"Next, if I be appointed for the place,"
6753,Henry VI Part 2,47,1.3.166,YORK,"My Lord of Somerset will keep me here,"
6754,Henry VI Part 2,47,1.3.167,YORK,"Without discharge, money, or furniture,"

6762,Henry VI Part 2,50,,WARWICK,"Enter HORNER, the Armourer, and his man PETER, guarded"
6763,Henry VI Part 2,51,1.3.175,SUFFOLK,Because here is a man accused of treason:

6765,Henry VI Part 2,52,1.3.177,YORK,Doth any one accuse York for a traitor?
6766,Henry VI Part 2,53,1.3.178,KING HENRY VI,"What mean'st thou, Suffolk, tell me, what are these?"
6767,Henry VI Part 2,54,1.3.179,SUFFOLK,"Please it your majesty, this is the man"
6768,Henry VI Part 2,54,1.3.180,SUFFOLK,That doth accuse his master of high treason:
6769,Henry VI Part 2,54,1.3.181,SUFFOLK,"His words were these: that Richard, Duke of York,"
6770,Henry VI Part 2,54,1.3.182,SUFFOLK,Was rightful heir unto the English crown
6771,Henry VI Part 2,54,1.3.183,SUFFOLK,And that your majesty was a usurper.
6772,Henry VI Part 2,55,1.3.184,KING HENRY VI,"Say, man, were these thy words?"
6773,Henry VI Part 2,56,1.3.185,HORNER,"An't shall please your majesty, I never said nor"
6774,Henry VI Part 2,56,1.3.186,HORNER,"thought any such matter: God is my witness, I am"
6775,Henry VI Part 2,56,1.3.187,HORNER,falsely accused by the villain.
6776,Henry VI Part 2,57,1.3.188,PETER,"By these ten bones, my lords, he did speak them to"
6777,Henry VI Part 2,57,1.3.189,PETER,"me in the garret one night, as we were scouring my"

6779,Henry VI Part 2,58,1.3.191,YORK,"Base dunghill villain and mechanical,"
6780,Henry VI Part 2,58,1.3.192,YORK,I'll have thy head for this thy traitor's speech.
6781,Henry VI Part 2,58,1.3.193,YORK,"I do beseech your royal majesty,"
6782,Henry VI Part 2,58,1.3.194,YORK,Let him have all the rigor of the law.
6783,Henry VI Part 2,59,1.3.195,HORNER,"Alas, my lord, hang me, if ever I spake the words."

6786,Henry VI Part 2,59,1.3.198,HORNER,knees he would be even with me: I have good
6787,Henry VI Part 2,59,1.3.199,HORNER,"witness of this: therefore I beseech your majesty,"
6788,Henry VI Part 2,59,1.3.200,HORNER,do not cast away an honest man for a villain's

6793,Henry VI Part 2,61,1.3.205,GLOUCESTER,Because in York this breeds suspicion:

6796,Henry VI Part 2,61,1.3.208,GLOUCESTER,For he hath witness of his servant's malice:

6798,Henry VI Part 2,62,1.3.210,SOMERSET,I humbly thank your royal majesty.
6799,Henry VI Part 2,63,1.3.211,HORNER,And I accept the combat willingly.

6888,Henry VI Part 2,20,1.4.68,YORK,"Let him shun castles,"
6889,Henry VI Part 2,20,1.4.69,YORK,Safer shall he be upon the sandy plains
6890,Henry VI Part 2,20,1.4.70,YORK,Than where castles mounted stand.'

6909,Henry VI Part 2,22,,YORK,"Enter KING HENRY VI, QUEEN MARGARET, GLOUCESTER, CARDINAL, and SUFFOLK, with Falconers halloing"
6910,Henry VI Part 2,1,2.1.1,QUEEN MARGARET,"Believe me, lords, for flying at the brook,"
6911,Henry VI Part 2,1,2.1.2,QUEEN MARGARET,I saw not better sport these seven years' day:
6912,Henry VI Part 2,1,2.1.3,QUEEN MARGARET,"Yet, by your leave, the wind was very high,"
6913,Henry VI Part 2,1,2.1.4,QUEEN MARGARET,"And, ten to one, old Joan had not gone out."
6914,Henry VI Part 2,2,2.1.5,KING HENRY VI,"But what a point, my lord, your falcon made,"
6915,Henry VI Part 2,2,2.1.6,KING HENRY VI,And what a pitch she flew above the rest!
6916,Henry VI Part 2,2,2.1.7,KING HENRY VI,To see how God in all his creatures works!
6917,Henry VI Part 2,2,2.1.8,KING HENRY VI,"Yea, man and birds are fain of climbing high."
6918,Henry VI Part 2,3,2.1.9,SUFFOLK,"No marvel, an it like your majesty,"
6919,Henry VI Part 2,3,2.1.10,SUFFOLK,"My lord protector's hawks do tower so well,"
6920,Henry VI Part 2,3,2.1.11,SUFFOLK,"They know their master loves to be aloft,"
6921,Henry VI Part 2,3,2.1.12,SUFFOLK,And bears his thoughts above his falcon's pitch.
6922,Henry VI Part 2,4,2.1.13,GLOUCESTER,"My lord, 'tis but a base ignoble mind"
6923,Henry VI Part 2,4,2.1.14,GLOUCESTER,That mounts no higher than a bird can soar.
6924,Henry VI Part 2,5,2.1.15,CARDINAL,"I thought as much, he would be above the clouds."
6925,Henry VI Part 2,6,2.1.16,GLOUCESTER,"Ay, my lord cardinal? how think you by that?"
6926,Henry VI Part 2,6,2.1.17,GLOUCESTER,Were it not good your grace could fly to heaven?
6927,Henry VI Part 2,7,2.1.18,KING HENRY VI,The treasury of everlasting joy.
6928,Henry VI Part 2,8,2.1.19,CARDINAL,"Thy heaven is on earth, thine eyes and thoughts"
6929,Henry VI Part 2,8,2.1.20,CARDINAL,"Beat on a crown, the treasure of thy heart,"
6930,Henry VI Part 2,8,2.1.21,CARDINAL,"Pernicious protector, dangerous peer,"
6931,Henry VI Part 2,8,2.1.22,CARDINAL,That smooth'st it so with king and commonweal!
6932,Henry VI Part 2,9,2.1.23,GLOUCESTER,"What, cardinal, is your priesthood grown peremptory?"
6933,Henry VI Part 2,9,2.1.24,GLOUCESTER,Tantaene animis coelestibus irae?
6934,Henry VI Part 2,9,2.1.25,GLOUCESTER,"Churchmen so hot? good uncle, hide such malice,"
6935,Henry VI Part 2,9,2.1.26,GLOUCESTER,With such holiness can you do it?
6936,Henry VI Part 2,10,2.1.27,SUFFOLK,"No malice, sir, no more than well becomes"
6937,Henry VI Part 2,10,2.1.28,SUFFOLK,So good a quarrel and so bad a peer.
6938,Henry VI Part 2,11,2.1.29,GLOUCESTER,"As who, my lord?"
6939,Henry VI Part 2,12,2.1.30,SUFFOLK,"Why, as you, my lord,"
6940,Henry VI Part 2,12,2.1.31,SUFFOLK,An't like your lordly lord-protectorship.
6941,Henry VI Part 2,13,2.1.32,GLOUCESTER,"Why, Suffolk, England knows thine insolence."
6942,Henry VI Part 2,14,2.1.33,QUEEN MARGARET,"And thy ambition, Gloucester."
6943,Henry VI Part 2,15,2.1.34,KING HENRY VI,"I prithee, peace, good queen,"
6944,Henry VI Part 2,15,2.1.35,KING HENRY VI,"And whet not on these furious peers,"
6945,Henry VI Part 2,15,2.1.36,KING HENRY VI,For blessed are the peacemakers on earth.
6946,Henry VI Part 2,16,2.1.37,CARDINAL,"Let me be blessed for the peace I make,"
6947,Henry VI Part 2,16,2.1.38,CARDINAL,"Against this proud protector, with my sword!"
6948,Henry VI Part 2,17,2.1.39,GLOUCESTER,"[Aside to CARDINAL]  Faith, holy uncle, would"
6949,Henry VI Part 2,17,2.1.40,GLOUCESTER,'twere come to that!

6952,Henry VI Part 2,19,2.1.43,GLOUCESTER,"numbers for the matter,"

6954,Henry VI Part 2,20,2.1.45,CARDINAL,"[Aside to GLOUCESTER]  Ay, where thou darest"
6955,Henry VI Part 2,20,2.1.46,CARDINAL,"not peep: an if thou darest,"
6956,Henry VI Part 2,20,2.1.47,CARDINAL,"This evening, on the east side of the grove."
6957,Henry VI Part 2,21,2.1.48,KING HENRY VI,"How now, my lords!"
6958,Henry VI Part 2,22,2.1.49,CARDINAL,"Believe me, cousin Gloucester,"
6959,Henry VI Part 2,22,2.1.50,CARDINAL,"Had not your man put up the fowl so suddenly,"
6960,Henry VI Part 2,22,2.1.51,CARDINAL,We had had more sport.
6961,Henry VI Part 2,22,,CARDINAL,Aside to GLOUCESTER
6962,Henry VI Part 2,22,2.1.52,CARDINAL,Come with thy two-hand sword.
6963,Henry VI Part 2,23,2.1.53,GLOUCESTER,"True, uncle."
6964,Henry VI Part 2,24,2.1.54,CARDINAL,[Aside to GLOUCESTER]  Are ye advised? the
6965,Henry VI Part 2,24,2.1.55,CARDINAL,east side of the grove?
6966,Henry VI Part 2,25,2.1.56,GLOUCESTER,"[Aside to CARDINAL]  Cardinal, I am with you."
6967,Henry VI Part 2,26,2.1.57,KING HENRY VI,"Why, how now, uncle Gloucester!"
6968,Henry VI Part 2,27,2.1.58,GLOUCESTER,"Talking of hawking, nothing else, my lord."
6969,Henry VI Part 2,27,,GLOUCESTER,Aside to CARDINAL
6970,Henry VI Part 2,27,2.1.59,GLOUCESTER,"Now, by God's mother, priest, I'll shave your crown for this,"
6971,Henry VI Part 2,27,2.1.60,GLOUCESTER,Or all my fence shall fail.
6972,Henry VI Part 2,28,2.1.61,CARDINAL,"[Aside to GLOUCESTER]  Medice, teipsum--"
6973,Henry VI Part 2,28,2.1.62,CARDINAL,"Protector, see to't well, protect yourself."
6974,Henry VI Part 2,29,2.1.63,KING HENRY VI,"The winds grow high, so do your stomachs, lords."
6975,Henry VI Part 2,29,2.1.64,KING HENRY VI,How irksome is this music to my heart!
6976,Henry VI Part 2,29,2.1.65,KING HENRY VI,"When such strings jar, what hope of harmony?"
6977,Henry VI Part 2,29,2.1.66,KING HENRY VI,"I pray, my lords, let me compound this strife."
6978,Henry VI Part 2,29,2.1.66,KING HENRY VI,"Enter a Townsman of Saint Alban's, crying 'A miracle!'"
6979,Henry VI Part 2,30,2.1.67,GLOUCESTER,What means this noise?
6980,Henry VI Part 2,30,2.1.68,GLOUCESTER,"Fellow, what miracle dost thou proclaim?"
6981,Henry VI Part 2,31,2.1.69,Townsman,A miracle! a miracle!
6982,Henry VI Part 2,32,2.1.70,SUFFOLK,Come to the king and tell him what miracle.
6983,Henry VI Part 2,33,2.1.71,Townsman,"Forsooth, a blind man at Saint Alban's shrine,"
6984,Henry VI Part 2,33,2.1.72,Townsman,"Within this half-hour, hath received his sight,"
6985,Henry VI Part 2,33,2.1.73,Townsman,A man that ne'er saw in his life before.
6986,Henry VI Part 2,34,2.1.74,KING HENRY VI,"Now, God be praised, that to believing souls"
6987,Henry VI Part 2,34,2.1.75,KING HENRY VI,"Gives light in darkness, comfort in despair!"
6988,Henry VI Part 2,34,,KING HENRY VI,"Enter the Mayor of Saint Alban's and his  brethren, bearing SIMPCOX, between two in a chair, SIMPCOX's Wife following"
6989,Henry VI Part 2,35,2.1.76,CARDINAL,"Here comes the townsmen on procession,"
6990,Henry VI Part 2,35,2.1.77,CARDINAL,To present your highness with the man.
6991,Henry VI Part 2,36,2.1.78,KING HENRY VI,"Great is his comfort in this earthly vale,"
6992,Henry VI Part 2,36,2.1.79,KING HENRY VI,Although by his sight his sin be multiplied.
6993,Henry VI Part 2,37,2.1.80,GLOUCESTER,"Stand by, my masters: bring him near the king,"
6994,Henry VI Part 2,37,2.1.81,GLOUCESTER,His highness' pleasure is to talk with him.
6995,Henry VI Part 2,38,2.1.82,KING HENRY VI,"Good fellow, tell us here the circumstance,"
6996,Henry VI Part 2,38,2.1.83,KING HENRY VI,That we for thee may glorify the Lord.
6997,Henry VI Part 2,38,2.1.84,KING HENRY VI,"What, hast thou been long blind and now restored?"
6998,Henry VI Part 2,39,2.1.85,SIMPCOX,"Born blind, an't please your grace."
6999,Henry VI Part 2,40,2.1.86,Wife,"Ay, indeed, was he."
7000,Henry VI Part 2,41,2.1.87,SUFFOLK,What woman is this?
7001,Henry VI Part 2,42,2.1.88,Wife,"His wife, an't like your worship."
7002,Henry VI Part 2,43,2.1.89,GLOUCESTER,"Hadst thou been his mother, thou couldst have"
7003,Henry VI Part 2,43,2.1.90,GLOUCESTER,better told.
7004,Henry VI Part 2,44,2.1.91,KING HENRY VI,Where wert thou born?
7005,Henry VI Part 2,45,2.1.92,SIMPCOX,"At Berwick in the north, an't like your grace."
7006,Henry VI Part 2,46,2.1.93,KING HENRY VI,"Poor soul, God's goodness hath been great to thee:"
7007,Henry VI Part 2,46,2.1.94,KING HENRY VI,"Let never day nor night unhallow'd pass,"
7008,Henry VI Part 2,46,2.1.95,KING HENRY VI,But still remember what the Lord hath done.
7009,Henry VI Part 2,47,2.1.96,QUEEN MARGARET,"Tell me, good fellow, camest thou here by chance,"
7010,Henry VI Part 2,47,2.1.97,QUEEN MARGARET,"Or of devotion, to this holy shrine?"
7011,Henry VI Part 2,48,2.1.98,SIMPCOX,"God knows, of pure devotion, being call'd"
7012,Henry VI Part 2,48,2.1.99,SIMPCOX,"A hundred times and oftener, in my sleep,"
7013,Henry VI Part 2,48,2.1.100,SIMPCOX,"By good Saint Alban, who said, 'Simpcox, come,"
7014,Henry VI Part 2,48,2.1.101,SIMPCOX,"Come, offer at my shrine, and I will help thee.'"
7015,Henry VI Part 2,49,2.1.102,Wife,"Most true, forsooth, and many time and oft"
7016,Henry VI Part 2,49,2.1.103,Wife,Myself have heard a voice to call him so.
7017,Henry VI Part 2,50,2.1.104,CARDINAL,"What, art thou lame?"
7018,Henry VI Part 2,51,2.1.105,SIMPCOX,"Ay, God Almighty help me!"
7019,Henry VI Part 2,52,2.1.106,SUFFOLK,How camest thou so?
7020,Henry VI Part 2,53,2.1.107,SIMPCOX,A fall off of a tree.
7021,Henry VI Part 2,54,2.1.108,Wife,"A plum-tree, master."
7022,Henry VI Part 2,55,2.1.109,GLOUCESTER,How long hast thou been blind?
7023,Henry VI Part 2,56,2.1.110,SIMPCOX,"Born so, master."
7024,Henry VI Part 2,57,2.1.111,GLOUCESTER,"What, and wouldst climb a tree?"
7025,Henry VI Part 2,58,2.1.112,SIMPCOX,"But that in all my life, when I was a youth."
7026,Henry VI Part 2,59,2.1.113,Wife,"Too true, and bought his climbing very dear."
7027,Henry VI Part 2,60,2.1.114,GLOUCESTER,"Mass, thou lovedst plums well, that wouldst"
7028,Henry VI Part 2,60,2.1.115,GLOUCESTER,venture so.
7029,Henry VI Part 2,61,2.1.116,SIMPCOX,"Alas,  good master, my wife desired some damsons,"
7030,Henry VI Part 2,61,2.1.117,SIMPCOX,"And made me climb, with danger of my life."
7031,Henry VI Part 2,62,2.1.118,GLOUCESTER,A subtle knave! but yet it shall not serve.
7032,Henry VI Part 2,62,2.1.119,GLOUCESTER,Let me see thine eyes: wink now: now open them:
7033,Henry VI Part 2,62,2.1.120,GLOUCESTER,In my opinion yet thou seest not well.
7034,Henry VI Part 2,63,2.1.121,SIMPCOX,"Yes, master, clear as day, I thank God and"
7035,Henry VI Part 2,63,2.1.122,SIMPCOX,Saint Alban.
7036,Henry VI Part 2,64,2.1.123,GLOUCESTER,Say'st thou me so? What colour is this cloak of?
7037,Henry VI Part 2,65,2.1.124,SIMPCOX,"Red, master, red as blood."
7038,Henry VI Part 2,66,2.1.125,GLOUCESTER,"Why, that's well said. What colour is my gown of?"
7039,Henry VI Part 2,67,2.1.126,SIMPCOX,"Black, forsooth: coal-black as jet."
7040,Henry VI Part 2,68,2.1.127,KING HENRY VI,"Why, then, thou know'st what colour jet is of?"
7041,Henry VI Part 2,69,2.1.128,SUFFOLK,"And yet, I think, jet did he never see."
7042,Henry VI Part 2,70,2.1.129,GLOUCESTER,"But cloaks and gowns, before this day, a many."
7043,Henry VI Part 2,71,2.1.130,Wife,"Never, before this day, in all his life."
7044,Henry VI Part 2,72,2.1.131,GLOUCESTER,"Tell me, sirrah, what's my name?"
7045,Henry VI Part 2,73,2.1.132,SIMPCOX,"Alas, master, I know not."
7046,Henry VI Part 2,74,2.1.133,GLOUCESTER,What's his name?
7047,Henry VI Part 2,75,2.1.134,SIMPCOX,I know not.
7048,Henry VI Part 2,76,2.1.135,GLOUCESTER,Nor his?
7049,Henry VI Part 2,77,2.1.136,SIMPCOX,"No, indeed, master."
7050,Henry VI Part 2,78,2.1.137,GLOUCESTER,What's thine own name?
7051,Henry VI Part 2,79,2.1.138,SIMPCOX,"Saunder Simpcox, an if it please you, master."
7052,Henry VI Part 2,80,2.1.139,GLOUCESTER,"Then, Saunder, sit there, the lyingest knave in"
7053,Henry VI Part 2,80,2.1.140,GLOUCESTER,"Christendom. If thou hadst been born blind, thou"
7054,Henry VI Part 2,80,2.1.141,GLOUCESTER,mightest as well have known all our names as thus to
7055,Henry VI Part 2,80,2.1.142,GLOUCESTER,name the several colours we do wear. Sight may
7056,Henry VI Part 2,80,2.1.143,GLOUCESTER,"distinguish of colours, but suddenly to nominate them"
7057,Henry VI Part 2,80,2.1.144,GLOUCESTER,"all, it is impossible. My lords, Saint Alban here"
7058,Henry VI Part 2,80,2.1.145,GLOUCESTER,"hath done a miracle, and would ye not think his"
7059,Henry VI Part 2,80,2.1.146,GLOUCESTER,"cunning to be great, that could restore this cripple"
7060,Henry VI Part 2,80,2.1.147,GLOUCESTER,to his legs again?
7061,Henry VI Part 2,81,2.1.148,SIMPCOX,"O master, that you could!"
7062,Henry VI Part 2,82,2.1.149,GLOUCESTER,"My masters of Saint Alban's, have you not beadles in"
7063,Henry VI Part 2,82,2.1.150,GLOUCESTER,"your town, and things called whips?"
7064,Henry VI Part 2,83,2.1.151,Mayor,"Yes, my lord, if it please your grace."
7065,Henry VI Part 2,84,2.1.152,GLOUCESTER,Then send for one presently.
7066,Henry VI Part 2,85,2.1.153,Mayor,"Sirrah, go fetch the beadle hither straight."
7067,Henry VI Part 2,85,,Mayor,Exit an Attendant
7068,Henry VI Part 2,86,2.1.154,GLOUCESTER,"Now fetch me a stool hither by and by. Now, sirrah,"
7069,Henry VI Part 2,86,2.1.155,GLOUCESTER,"if you mean to save yourself from whipping, leap me"
7070,Henry VI Part 2,86,2.1.156,GLOUCESTER,over this stool and run away.
7071,Henry VI Part 2,87,2.1.157,SIMPCOX,"Alas, master, I am not able to stand alone:"
7072,Henry VI Part 2,87,2.1.158,SIMPCOX,You go about to torture me in vain.
7073,Henry VI Part 2,87,,SIMPCOX,Enter a Beadle with whips
7074,Henry VI Part 2,88,2.1.159,GLOUCESTER,"Well, sir, we must have you find your legs. Sirrah"
7075,Henry VI Part 2,88,2.1.160,GLOUCESTER,"beadle, whip him till he leap over that same stool."
7076,Henry VI Part 2,89,2.1.161,Beadle,"I will, my lord. Come on, sirrah, off with your"
7077,Henry VI Part 2,89,2.1.162,Beadle,doublet quickly.
7078,Henry VI Part 2,90,2.1.163,SIMPCOX,"Alas, master, what shall I do? I am not able to stand."
7079,Henry VI Part 2,90,2.1.163,SIMPCOX,"After the Beadle hath hit him once, he leaps over the stool and runs away, and they follow and cry, 'A miracle!'"
7080,Henry VI Part 2,91,2.1.164,KING HENRY VI,"O God, seest Thou this, and bearest so long?"
7081,Henry VI Part 2,92,2.1.165,QUEEN MARGARET,It made me laugh to see the villain run.
7082,Henry VI Part 2,93,2.1.166,GLOUCESTER,"Follow the knave, and take this drab away."
7083,Henry VI Part 2,94,2.1.167,Wife,"Alas, sir, we did it for pure need."
7084,Henry VI Part 2,95,2.1.168,GLOUCESTER,"Let them be whipped through every market-town, till"
7085,Henry VI Part 2,95,2.1.169,GLOUCESTER,"they come to Berwick, from whence they came."

7087,Henry VI Part 2,96,2.1.170,CARDINAL,Duke Humphrey has done a miracle to-day.
7088,Henry VI Part 2,97,2.1.171,SUFFOLK,"True, made the lame to leap and fly away."
7089,Henry VI Part 2,98,2.1.172,GLOUCESTER,"But you have done more miracles than I,"
7090,Henry VI Part 2,98,2.1.173,GLOUCESTER,"You made in a day, my lord, whole towns to fly."
7091,Henry VI Part 2,98,,GLOUCESTER,Enter BUCKINGHAM
7092,Henry VI Part 2,99,2.1.174,KING HENRY VI,What tidings with our cousin Buckingham?
7093,Henry VI Part 2,100,2.1.175,BUCKINGHAM,Such as my heart doth tremble to unfold.
7094,Henry VI Part 2,100,2.1.176,BUCKINGHAM,"A sort of naughty persons, lewdly bent,"

7098,Henry VI Part 2,100,2.1.180,BUCKINGHAM,"Have practised dangerously against your state,"
7099,Henry VI Part 2,100,2.1.181,BUCKINGHAM,Dealing with witches and with conjurers:
7100,Henry VI Part 2,100,2.1.182,BUCKINGHAM,"Whom we have apprehended in the fact,"
7101,Henry VI Part 2,100,2.1.183,BUCKINGHAM,"Raising up wicked spirits from under ground,"

7104,Henry VI Part 2,100,2.1.186,BUCKINGHAM,As more at large your grace shall understand.
7105,Henry VI Part 2,101,2.1.187,CARDINAL,"[Aside to GLOUCESTER]  And so, my lord protector,"
7106,Henry VI Part 2,101,2.1.188,CARDINAL,by this means
7107,Henry VI Part 2,101,2.1.189,CARDINAL,Your lady is forthcoming yet at London.
7108,Henry VI Part 2,101,2.1.190,CARDINAL,"This news, I think, hath turn'd your weapon's edge,"
7109,Henry VI Part 2,101,2.1.191,CARDINAL,"'Tis like, my lord, you will not keep your hour."
7110,Henry VI Part 2,102,2.1.192,GLOUCESTER,"Ambitious churchman, leave to afflict my heart:"
7111,Henry VI Part 2,102,2.1.193,GLOUCESTER,"Sorrow and grief have vanquish'd all my powers,"
7112,Henry VI Part 2,102,2.1.194,GLOUCESTER,"And, vanquish'd as I am, I yield to thee,"
7113,Henry VI Part 2,102,2.1.195,GLOUCESTER,Or to the meanest groom.
7114,Henry VI Part 2,103,2.1.196,KING HENRY VI,"O God, what mischiefs work the wicked ones,"
7115,Henry VI Part 2,103,2.1.197,KING HENRY VI,Heaping confusion on their own heads thereby!
7116,Henry VI Part 2,104,2.1.198,QUEEN MARGARET,"Gloucester, see here the tainture of thy nest."
7117,Henry VI Part 2,104,2.1.199,QUEEN MARGARET,"And look thyself be faultless, thou wert best."
7118,Henry VI Part 2,105,2.1.200,GLOUCESTER,"Madam, for myself, to heaven I do appeal,"
7119,Henry VI Part 2,105,2.1.201,GLOUCESTER,How I have loved my king and commonweal:
7120,Henry VI Part 2,105,2.1.202,GLOUCESTER,"And, for my wife, I know not how it stands,"
7121,Henry VI Part 2,105,2.1.203,GLOUCESTER,Sorry I am to hear what I have heard:
7122,Henry VI Part 2,105,2.1.204,GLOUCESTER,"Noble she is, but if she have forgot"
7123,Henry VI Part 2,105,2.1.205,GLOUCESTER,Honour and virtue and conversed with such
7124,Henry VI Part 2,105,2.1.206,GLOUCESTER,"As, like to pitch, defile nobility,"
7125,Henry VI Part 2,105,2.1.207,GLOUCESTER,I banish her my bed and company
7126,Henry VI Part 2,105,2.1.208,GLOUCESTER,"And give her as a prey to law and shame,"
7127,Henry VI Part 2,105,2.1.209,GLOUCESTER,That hath dishonour'd Gloucester's honest name.
7128,Henry VI Part 2,106,2.1.210,KING HENRY VI,"Well, for this night we will repose us here:"
7129,Henry VI Part 2,106,2.1.211,KING HENRY VI,"To-morrow toward London back again,"
7130,Henry VI Part 2,106,2.1.212,KING HENRY VI,To look into this business thoroughly
7131,Henry VI Part 2,106,2.1.213,KING HENRY VI,And call these foul offenders to their answers
7132,Henry VI Part 2,106,2.1.214,KING HENRY VI,"And poise the cause in justice' equal scales,"
7133,Henry VI Part 2,106,2.1.215,KING HENRY VI,"Whose beam stands sure, whose rightful cause prevails."
7134,Henry VI Part 2,106,,KING HENRY VI,Flourish. Exeunt
7135,Henry VI Part 2,106,,KING HENRY VI,SCENE II. London. YORK'S garden.
7136,Henry VI Part 2,106,,KING HENRY VI,"Enter YORK, SALISBURY, and WARWICK"
7137,Henry VI Part 2,1,2.2.1,YORK,"Now, my good Lords of Salisbury and Warwick,"
7138,Henry VI Part 2,1,2.2.2,YORK,"Our simple supper ended, give me leave"
7139,Henry VI Part 2,1,2.2.3,YORK,"In this close walk to satisfy myself,"
7140,Henry VI Part 2,1,2.2.4,YORK,"In craving your opinion of my title,"
7141,Henry VI Part 2,1,2.2.5,YORK,"Which is infallible, to England's crown."
7142,Henry VI Part 2,2,2.2.6,SALISBURY,"My lord, I long to hear it at full."
7143,Henry VI Part 2,3,2.2.7,WARWICK,"Sweet York, begin: and if thy claim be good,"
7144,Henry VI Part 2,3,2.2.8,WARWICK,The Nevils are thy subjects to command.
7145,Henry VI Part 2,4,2.2.9,YORK,Then thus:
7146,Henry VI Part 2,4,2.2.10,YORK,"Edward the Third, my lords, had seven sons:"
7147,Henry VI Part 2,4,2.2.11,YORK,"The first, Edward the Black Prince, Prince of Wales,"
7148,Henry VI Part 2,4,2.2.12,YORK,"The second, William of Hatfield, and the third,"
7149,Henry VI Part 2,4,2.2.13,YORK,Lionel Duke of Clarence: next to whom
7150,Henry VI Part 2,4,2.2.14,YORK,"Was John of Gaunt, the Duke of Lancaster,"
7151,Henry VI Part 2,4,2.2.15,YORK,"The fifth was Edmund Langley, Duke of York,"
7152,Henry VI Part 2,4,2.2.16,YORK,"The sixth was Thomas of Woodstock, Duke of Gloucester,"
7153,Henry VI Part 2,4,2.2.17,YORK,William of Windsor was the seventh and last.
7154,Henry VI Part 2,4,2.2.18,YORK,Edward the Black Prince died before his father
7155,Henry VI Part 2,4,2.2.19,YORK,"And left behind him Richard, his only son,"
7156,Henry VI Part 2,4,2.2.20,YORK,"Who after Edward the Third's death reign'd as king,"
7157,Henry VI Part 2,4,2.2.21,YORK,"Till Henry Bolingbroke, Duke of Lancaster,"
7158,Henry VI Part 2,4,2.2.22,YORK,"The eldest son and heir of John of Gaunt,"
7159,Henry VI Part 2,4,2.2.23,YORK,"Crown'd by the name of Henry the Fourth,"
7160,Henry VI Part 2,4,2.2.24,YORK,"Seized on the realm, deposed the rightful king,"
7161,Henry VI Part 2,4,2.2.25,YORK,"Sent his poor queen to France, from whence she came,"
7162,Henry VI Part 2,4,2.2.26,YORK,"And him to Pomfret, where, as all you know,"
7163,Henry VI Part 2,4,2.2.27,YORK,Harmless Richard was murder'd traitorously.
7164,Henry VI Part 2,5,2.2.28,WARWICK,"Father, the duke hath told the truth:"
7165,Henry VI Part 2,5,2.2.29,WARWICK,Thus got the house of Lancaster the crown.
7166,Henry VI Part 2,6,2.2.30,YORK,"Which now they hold by force and not by right,"
7167,Henry VI Part 2,6,2.2.31,YORK,"For Richard, the first son's heir, being dead,"
7168,Henry VI Part 2,6,2.2.32,YORK,The issue of the next son should have reign'd.
7169,Henry VI Part 2,7,2.2.33,SALISBURY,But William of Hatfield died without an heir.
7170,Henry VI Part 2,8,2.2.34,YORK,"The third son, Duke of Clarence, from whose line"
7171,Henry VI Part 2,8,2.2.35,YORK,"I claimed the crown, had issue, Philippe, a daughter,"
7172,Henry VI Part 2,8,2.2.36,YORK,"Who married Edmund Mortimer, Earl of March:"
7173,Henry VI Part 2,8,2.2.37,YORK,"Edmund had issue, Roger Earl of March,"
7174,Henry VI Part 2,8,2.2.38,YORK,"Roger had issue, Edmund, Anne and Eleanor."
7175,Henry VI Part 2,9,2.2.39,SALISBURY,"This Edmund, in the reign of Bolingbroke,"
7176,Henry VI Part 2,9,2.2.40,SALISBURY,"As I have read, laid claim unto the crown,"
7177,Henry VI Part 2,9,2.2.41,SALISBURY,"And, but for Owen Glendower, had been king,"
7178,Henry VI Part 2,9,2.2.42,SALISBURY,Who kept him in captivity till he died.
7179,Henry VI Part 2,9,2.2.43,SALISBURY,But to the rest.
7180,Henry VI Part 2,10,2.2.44,YORK,"His eldest sister, Anne,"
7181,Henry VI Part 2,10,2.2.45,YORK,"My mother, being heir unto the crown"
7182,Henry VI Part 2,10,2.2.46,YORK,"Married Richard Earl of Cambridge, who was son"
7183,Henry VI Part 2,10,2.2.47,YORK,"To Edmund Langley, Edward the Third's fifth son."
7184,Henry VI Part 2,10,2.2.48,YORK,By her I claim the kingdom: she was heir
7185,Henry VI Part 2,10,2.2.49,YORK,"To Roger Earl of March, who was the son"
7186,Henry VI Part 2,10,2.2.50,YORK,"Of Edmund Mortimer, who married Philippe,"
7187,Henry VI Part 2,10,2.2.51,YORK,Sole daughter unto Lionel Duke of Clarence:
7188,Henry VI Part 2,10,2.2.52,YORK,"So, if the issue of the elder son"
7189,Henry VI Part 2,10,2.2.53,YORK,"Succeed before the younger, I am king."
7190,Henry VI Part 2,11,2.2.54,WARWICK,What plain proceeding is more plain than this?
7191,Henry VI Part 2,11,2.2.55,WARWICK,"Henry doth claim the crown from John of Gaunt,"
7192,Henry VI Part 2,11,2.2.56,WARWICK,"The fourth son, York claims it from the third."
7193,Henry VI Part 2,11,2.2.57,WARWICK,"Till Lionel's issue fails, his should not reign:"
7194,Henry VI Part 2,11,2.2.58,WARWICK,"It fails not yet, but flourishes in thee"
7195,Henry VI Part 2,11,2.2.59,WARWICK,"And in thy sons, fair slips of such a stock."
7196,Henry VI Part 2,11,2.2.60,WARWICK,"Then, father Salisbury, kneel we together,"
7197,Henry VI Part 2,11,2.2.61,WARWICK,And in this private plot be we the first
7198,Henry VI Part 2,11,2.2.62,WARWICK,That shall salute our rightful sovereign
7199,Henry VI Part 2,11,2.2.63,WARWICK,With honour of his birthright to the crown.
7200,Henry VI Part 2,12,2.2.64,BOTH,"Long live our sovereign Richard, England's king!"
7201,Henry VI Part 2,13,2.2.65,YORK,"We thank you, lords. But I am not your king"
7202,Henry VI Part 2,13,2.2.66,YORK,Till I be crown'd and that my sword be stain'd
7203,Henry VI Part 2,13,2.2.67,YORK,"With heart-blood of the house of Lancaster,"
7204,Henry VI Part 2,13,2.2.68,YORK,"And that's not suddenly to be perform'd,"
7205,Henry VI Part 2,13,2.2.69,YORK,But with advice and silent secrecy.
7206,Henry VI Part 2,13,2.2.70,YORK,Do you as I do in these dangerous days:
7207,Henry VI Part 2,13,2.2.71,YORK,"Wink at the Duke of Suffolk's insolence,"
7208,Henry VI Part 2,13,2.2.72,YORK,"At Beaufort's pride, at Somerset's ambition,"
7209,Henry VI Part 2,13,2.2.73,YORK,"At Buckingham and all the crew of them,"
7210,Henry VI Part 2,13,2.2.74,YORK,"Till they have snared the shepherd of the flock,"
7211,Henry VI Part 2,13,2.2.75,YORK,"That virtuous prince, the good Duke Humphrey:"
7212,Henry VI Part 2,13,2.2.76,YORK,"'Tis that they seek, and they in seeking that"
7213,Henry VI Part 2,13,2.2.77,YORK,"Shall find their deaths, if York can prophesy."
7214,Henry VI Part 2,14,2.2.78,SALISBURY,"My lord, break we off, we know your mind at full."
7215,Henry VI Part 2,15,2.2.79,WARWICK,My heart assures me that the Earl of Warwick
7216,Henry VI Part 2,15,2.2.80,WARWICK,Shall one day make the Duke of York a king.
7217,Henry VI Part 2,16,2.2.81,YORK,"And, Nevil, this I do assure myself:"
7218,Henry VI Part 2,16,2.2.82,YORK,Richard shall live to make the Earl of Warwick
7219,Henry VI Part 2,16,2.2.83,YORK,The greatest man in England but the king.
7220,Henry VI Part 2,16,,YORK,Exeunt
7221,Henry VI Part 2,16,,YORK,SCENE III. A hall of justice.
7222,Henry VI Part 2,16,,YORK,"Sound trumpets. Enter KING HENRY VI, QUEEN  MARGARET, GLOUCESTER, YORK, SUFFOLK, and SALISBURY,  the DUCHESS, MARGARET JOURDAIN, SOUTHWELL, HUME, and BOLINGBROKE, under guard"

7224,Henry VI Part 2,1,2.3.2,KING HENRY VI,"In sight of God and us, your guilt is great:"
7225,Henry VI Part 2,1,2.3.3,KING HENRY VI,Receive the sentence of the law for sins
7226,Henry VI Part 2,1,2.3.4,KING HENRY VI,Such as by God's book are adjudged to death.
7227,Henry VI Part 2,1,2.3.5,KING HENRY VI,"You four, from hence to prison back again,"
7228,Henry VI Part 2,1,2.3.6,KING HENRY VI,From thence unto the place of execution:
7229,Henry VI Part 2,1,2.3.7,KING HENRY VI,"The witch in Smithfield shall be burn'd to ashes,"
7230,Henry VI Part 2,1,2.3.8,KING HENRY VI,And you three shall be strangled on the gallows.
7231,Henry VI Part 2,1,2.3.9,KING HENRY VI,"You, madam, for you are more nobly born,"
7232,Henry VI Part 2,1,2.3.10,KING HENRY VI,"Despoiled of your honour in your life,"
7233,Henry VI Part 2,1,2.3.11,KING HENRY VI,"Shall, after three days' open penance done,"
7234,Henry VI Part 2,1,2.3.12,KING HENRY VI,"Live in your country here in banishment,"

7236,Henry VI Part 2,2,2.3.14,DUCHESS,"Welcome is banishment, welcome were my death."
7237,Henry VI Part 2,3,2.3.15,GLOUCESTER,"Eleanor, the law, thou see'st, hath judged thee:"
7238,Henry VI Part 2,3,2.3.16,GLOUCESTER,I cannot justify whom the law condemns.
7239,Henry VI Part 2,3,,GLOUCESTER,"Exeunt DUCHESS and other prisoners, guarded"
7240,Henry VI Part 2,3,2.3.17,GLOUCESTER,"Mine eyes are full of tears, my heart of grief."
7241,Henry VI Part 2,3,2.3.18,GLOUCESTER,"Ah, Humphrey, this dishonour in thine age"
7242,Henry VI Part 2,3,2.3.19,GLOUCESTER,Will bring thy head with sorrow to the ground!
7243,Henry VI Part 2,3,2.3.20,GLOUCESTER,"I beseech your majesty, give me leave to go,"
7244,Henry VI Part 2,3,2.3.21,GLOUCESTER,Sorrow would solace and mine age would ease.
7245,Henry VI Part 2,4,2.3.22,KING HENRY VI,"Stay, Humphrey Duke of Gloucester: ere thou go,"
7246,Henry VI Part 2,4,2.3.23,KING HENRY VI,Give up thy staff: Henry will to himself

7249,Henry VI Part 2,4,2.3.26,KING HENRY VI,"And go in peace, Humphrey, no less beloved"
7250,Henry VI Part 2,4,2.3.27,KING HENRY VI,Than when thou wert protector to thy King.
7251,Henry VI Part 2,5,2.3.28,QUEEN MARGARET,I see no reason why a king of years
7252,Henry VI Part 2,5,2.3.29,QUEEN MARGARET,Should be to be protected like a child.
7253,Henry VI Part 2,5,2.3.30,QUEEN MARGARET,God and King Henry govern England's realm.
7254,Henry VI Part 2,5,2.3.31,QUEEN MARGARET,"Give up your staff, sir, and the king his realm."

7256,Henry VI Part 2,6,2.3.33,GLOUCESTER,As willingly do I the same resign
7257,Henry VI Part 2,6,2.3.34,GLOUCESTER,"As e'er thy father Henry made it mine,"
7258,Henry VI Part 2,6,2.3.35,GLOUCESTER,And even as willingly at thy feet I leave it
7259,Henry VI Part 2,6,2.3.36,GLOUCESTER,As others would ambitiously receive it.
7260,Henry VI Part 2,6,2.3.37,GLOUCESTER,"Farewell, good king: when I am dead and gone,"
7261,Henry VI Part 2,6,2.3.38,GLOUCESTER,May honourable peace attend thy throne!

7263,Henry VI Part 2,7,2.3.39,QUEEN MARGARET,"Why, now is Henry king, and Margaret queen,"

7265,Henry VI Part 2,7,2.3.41,QUEEN MARGARET,"That bears so shrewd a maim, two pulls at once,"
7266,Henry VI Part 2,7,2.3.42,QUEEN MARGARET,"His lady banish'd, and a limb lopp'd off."
7267,Henry VI Part 2,7,2.3.43,QUEEN MARGARET,"This staff of honour raught, there let it stand"

7270,Henry VI Part 2,8,2.3.46,SUFFOLK,Thus Eleanor's pride dies in her youngest days.

7279,Henry VI Part 2,11,2.3.55,KING HENRY VI,"Here let them end it, and God defend the right!"
7280,Henry VI Part 2,12,2.3.56,YORK,"I never saw a fellow worse bested,"
7281,Henry VI Part 2,12,2.3.57,YORK,"Or more afraid to fight, than is the appellant,"
7282,Henry VI Part 2,12,2.3.58,YORK,"The servant of this armourer, my lords."
7283,Henry VI Part 2,12,2.3.58,YORK,"Enter at one door, HORNER, the Armourer, and his  Neighbours, drinking to him so much that he is drunk,  and he enters with a drum before him and his staff  with a sand-bag fastened to it, and at the other  door PETER, his man, with a drum and sand-bag, and 'Prentices drinking to him"

7311,Henry VI Part 2,23,2.3.86,HORNER,"king, nor the queen: and therefore, Peter, have at"
7312,Henry VI Part 2,23,2.3.87,HORNER,thee with a downright blow!
7313,Henry VI Part 2,24,2.3.88,YORK,Dispatch: this knave's tongue begins to double.
7314,Henry VI Part 2,24,2.3.89,YORK,"Sound, trumpets, alarum to the combatants!"
7315,Henry VI Part 2,24,,YORK,"Alarum. They fight, and PETER strikes him down"
7316,Henry VI Part 2,25,2.3.90,HORNER,"Hold, Peter, hold! I confess, I confess treason."
7317,Henry VI Part 2,25,,HORNER,Dies
7318,Henry VI Part 2,26,2.3.91,YORK,"Take away his weapon. Fellow, thank God, and the"
7319,Henry VI Part 2,26,2.3.92,YORK,good wine in thy master's way.
7320,Henry VI Part 2,27,2.3.93,PETER,"O God, have I overcome mine enemy in this presence?"
7321,Henry VI Part 2,27,2.3.94,PETER,"O Peter, thou hast prevailed in right!"
7322,Henry VI Part 2,28,2.3.95,KING HENRY VI,"Go, take hence that traitor from our sight,"
7323,Henry VI Part 2,28,2.3.96,KING HENRY VI,For his death we do perceive his guilt:
7324,Henry VI Part 2,28,2.3.97,KING HENRY VI,And God in justice hath revealed to us
7325,Henry VI Part 2,28,2.3.98,KING HENRY VI,"The truth and innocence of this poor fellow,"
7326,Henry VI Part 2,28,2.3.99,KING HENRY VI,Which he had thought to have murder'd wrongfully.
7327,Henry VI Part 2,28,2.3.100,KING HENRY VI,"Come, fellow, follow us for thy reward."
7328,Henry VI Part 2,28,,KING HENRY VI,Sound a flourish. Exeunt
7329,Henry VI Part 2,28,,KING HENRY VI,SCENE IV. A street.
7330,Henry VI Part 2,28,,KING HENRY VI,"Enter GLOUCESTER and his Servingmen, in mourning cloaks"
7331,Henry VI Part 2,1,2.4.1,GLOUCESTER,"Thus sometimes hath the brightest day a cloud,"
7332,Henry VI Part 2,1,2.4.2,GLOUCESTER,And after summer evermore succeeds
7333,Henry VI Part 2,1,2.4.3,GLOUCESTER,"Barren winter, with his wrathful nipping cold:"
7334,Henry VI Part 2,1,2.4.4,GLOUCESTER,"So cares and joys abound, as seasons fleet."
7335,Henry VI Part 2,1,2.4.5,GLOUCESTER,"Sirs, what's o'clock?"
7336,Henry VI Part 2,2,2.4.6,Servants,"Ten, my lord."
7337,Henry VI Part 2,3,2.4.7,GLOUCESTER,Ten is the hour that was appointed me
7338,Henry VI Part 2,3,2.4.8,GLOUCESTER,To watch the coming of my punish'd duchess:
7339,Henry VI Part 2,3,2.4.9,GLOUCESTER,"Uneath may she endure the flinty streets,"
7340,Henry VI Part 2,3,2.4.10,GLOUCESTER,To tread them with her tender-feeling feet.
7341,Henry VI Part 2,3,2.4.11,GLOUCESTER,"Sweet Nell, ill can thy noble mind abrook"
7342,Henry VI Part 2,3,2.4.12,GLOUCESTER,"The abject people gazing on thy face,"
7343,Henry VI Part 2,3,2.4.13,GLOUCESTER,"With envious looks, laughing at thy shame,"
7344,Henry VI Part 2,3,2.4.14,GLOUCESTER,That erst did follow thy proud chariot-wheels
7345,Henry VI Part 2,3,2.4.15,GLOUCESTER,When thou didst ride in triumph through the streets.
7346,Henry VI Part 2,3,2.4.16,GLOUCESTER,"But, soft! I think she comes, and I'll prepare"
7347,Henry VI Part 2,3,2.4.17,GLOUCESTER,My tear-stain'd eyes to see her miseries.
7348,Henry VI Part 2,3,2.4.17,GLOUCESTER,"Enter the DUCHESS in a white sheet, and a taper  burning in her hand, with STANLEY, the Sheriff, and Officers"
7349,Henry VI Part 2,4,2.4.18,Servant,"So please your grace, we'll take her from the sheriff."
7350,Henry VI Part 2,5,2.4.19,GLOUCESTER,"No, stir not, for your lives, let her pass by."
7351,Henry VI Part 2,6,2.4.20,DUCHESS,"Come you, my lord, to see my open shame?"
7352,Henry VI Part 2,6,2.4.21,DUCHESS,Now thou dost penance too. Look how they gaze!
7353,Henry VI Part 2,6,2.4.22,DUCHESS,"See how the giddy multitude do point,"
7354,Henry VI Part 2,6,2.4.23,DUCHESS,"And nod their heads, and throw their eyes on thee!"
7355,Henry VI Part 2,6,2.4.24,DUCHESS,"Ah, Gloucester, hide thee from their hateful looks,"
7356,Henry VI Part 2,6,2.4.25,DUCHESS,"And, in thy closet pent up, rue my shame,"
7357,Henry VI Part 2,6,2.4.26,DUCHESS,"And ban thine enemies, both mine and thine!"
7358,Henry VI Part 2,7,2.4.27,GLOUCESTER,"Be patient, gentle Nell, forget this grief."
7359,Henry VI Part 2,8,2.4.28,DUCHESS,"Ah, Gloucester, teach me to forget myself!"
7360,Henry VI Part 2,8,2.4.29,DUCHESS,For whilst I think I am thy married wife
7361,Henry VI Part 2,8,2.4.30,DUCHESS,"And thou a prince, protector of this land,"
7362,Henry VI Part 2,8,2.4.31,DUCHESS,"Methinks I should not thus be led along,"
7363,Henry VI Part 2,8,2.4.32,DUCHESS,"Mail'd up in shame, with papers on my back,"
7364,Henry VI Part 2,8,2.4.33,DUCHESS,And followed with a rabble that rejoice
7365,Henry VI Part 2,8,2.4.34,DUCHESS,To see my tears and hear my deep-fet groans.
7366,Henry VI Part 2,8,2.4.35,DUCHESS,"The ruthless flint doth cut my tender feet,"
7367,Henry VI Part 2,8,2.4.36,DUCHESS,"And when I start, the envious people laugh"
7368,Henry VI Part 2,8,2.4.37,DUCHESS,And bid me be advised how I tread.
7369,Henry VI Part 2,8,2.4.38,DUCHESS,"Ah, Humphrey, can I bear this shameful yoke?"
7370,Henry VI Part 2,8,2.4.39,DUCHESS,"Trow'st thou that e'er I'll look upon the world,"
7371,Henry VI Part 2,8,2.4.40,DUCHESS,Or count them happy that enjoy the sun?
7372,Henry VI Part 2,8,2.4.41,DUCHESS,"No, dark shall be my light and night my day,"
7373,Henry VI Part 2,8,2.4.42,DUCHESS,To think upon my pomp shall be my hell.
7374,Henry VI Part 2,8,2.4.43,DUCHESS,"Sometime I'll say, I am Duke Humphrey's wife,"
7375,Henry VI Part 2,8,2.4.44,DUCHESS,And he a prince and ruler of the land:
7376,Henry VI Part 2,8,2.4.45,DUCHESS,Yet so he ruled and such a prince he was
7377,Henry VI Part 2,8,2.4.46,DUCHESS,"As he stood by whilst I, his forlorn duchess,"
7378,Henry VI Part 2,8,2.4.47,DUCHESS,Was made a wonder and a pointing-stock
7379,Henry VI Part 2,8,2.4.48,DUCHESS,To every idle rascal follower.
7380,Henry VI Part 2,8,2.4.49,DUCHESS,"But be thou mild and blush not at my shame,"
7381,Henry VI Part 2,8,2.4.50,DUCHESS,Nor stir at nothing till the axe of death
7382,Henry VI Part 2,8,2.4.51,DUCHESS,"Hang over thee, as, sure, it shortly will,"
7383,Henry VI Part 2,8,2.4.52,DUCHESS,"For Suffolk, he that can do all in all"
7384,Henry VI Part 2,8,2.4.53,DUCHESS,"With her that hateth thee and hates us all,"
7385,Henry VI Part 2,8,2.4.54,DUCHESS,"And York and impious Beaufort, that false priest,"
7386,Henry VI Part 2,8,2.4.55,DUCHESS,"Have all limed bushes to betray thy wings,"
7387,Henry VI Part 2,8,2.4.56,DUCHESS,"And, fly thou how thou canst, they'll tangle thee:"
7388,Henry VI Part 2,8,2.4.57,DUCHESS,"But fear not thou, until thy foot be snared,"
7389,Henry VI Part 2,8,2.4.58,DUCHESS,Nor never seek prevention of thy foes.
7390,Henry VI Part 2,9,2.4.59,GLOUCESTER,"Ah, Nell, forbear! thou aimest all awry,"
7391,Henry VI Part 2,9,2.4.60,GLOUCESTER,"I must offend before I be attainted,"
7392,Henry VI Part 2,9,2.4.61,GLOUCESTER,"And had I twenty times so many foes,"
7393,Henry VI Part 2,9,2.4.62,GLOUCESTER,"And each of them had twenty times their power,"
7394,Henry VI Part 2,9,2.4.63,GLOUCESTER,"All these could not procure me any scathe,"
7395,Henry VI Part 2,9,2.4.64,GLOUCESTER,"So long as I am loyal, true and crimeless."
7396,Henry VI Part 2,9,2.4.65,GLOUCESTER,Wouldst have me rescue thee from this reproach?
7397,Henry VI Part 2,9,2.4.66,GLOUCESTER,"Why, yet thy scandal were not wiped away"
7398,Henry VI Part 2,9,2.4.67,GLOUCESTER,But I in danger for the breach of law.
7399,Henry VI Part 2,9,2.4.68,GLOUCESTER,"Thy greatest help is quiet, gentle Nell:"
7400,Henry VI Part 2,9,2.4.69,GLOUCESTER,"I pray thee, sort thy heart to patience,"
7401,Henry VI Part 2,9,2.4.70,GLOUCESTER,These few days' wonder will be quickly worn.
7402,Henry VI Part 2,9,,GLOUCESTER,Enter a Herald
7403,Henry VI Part 2,10,2.4.71,Herald,"I summon your grace to his majesty's parliament,"
7404,Henry VI Part 2,10,2.4.72,Herald,Holden at Bury the first of this next month.
7405,Henry VI Part 2,11,2.4.73,GLOUCESTER,And my consent ne'er ask'd herein before!
7406,Henry VI Part 2,11,2.4.74,GLOUCESTER,"This is close dealing. Well, I will be there."
7407,Henry VI Part 2,11,,GLOUCESTER,Exit Herald
7408,Henry VI Part 2,11,2.4.75,GLOUCESTER,"My Nell, I take my leave: and, master sheriff,"
7409,Henry VI Part 2,11,2.4.76,GLOUCESTER,Let not her penance exceed the king's commission.
7410,Henry VI Part 2,12,2.4.77,Sheriff,"An't please your grace, here my commission stays,"
7411,Henry VI Part 2,12,2.4.78,Sheriff,And Sir John Stanley is appointed now
7412,Henry VI Part 2,12,2.4.79,Sheriff,To take her with him to the Isle of Man.
7413,Henry VI Part 2,13,2.4.80,GLOUCESTER,"Must you, Sir John, protect my lady here?"
7414,Henry VI Part 2,14,2.4.81,STANLEY,"So am I given in charge, may't please your grace."
7415,Henry VI Part 2,15,2.4.82,GLOUCESTER,Entreat her not the worse in that I pray
7416,Henry VI Part 2,15,2.4.83,GLOUCESTER,"You use her well: the world may laugh again,"
7417,Henry VI Part 2,15,2.4.84,GLOUCESTER,And I may live to do you kindness if
7418,Henry VI Part 2,15,2.4.85,GLOUCESTER,"You do it her: and so, Sir John, farewell!"
7419,Henry VI Part 2,16,2.4.86,DUCHESS,"What, gone, my lord, and bid me not farewell!"
7420,Henry VI Part 2,17,2.4.87,GLOUCESTER,"Witness my tears, I cannot stay to speak."
7421,Henry VI Part 2,17,,GLOUCESTER,Exeunt GLOUCESTER and Servingmen
7422,Henry VI Part 2,18,2.4.88,DUCHESS,Art thou gone too? all comfort go with thee!
7423,Henry VI Part 2,18,2.4.89,DUCHESS,"For none abides with me: my joy is death,"
7424,Henry VI Part 2,18,2.4.90,DUCHESS,"Death, at whose name I oft have been afear'd,"
7425,Henry VI Part 2,18,2.4.91,DUCHESS,Because I wish'd this world's eternity.
7426,Henry VI Part 2,18,2.4.92,DUCHESS,"Stanley, I prithee, go, and take me hence,"
7427,Henry VI Part 2,18,2.4.93,DUCHESS,"I care not whither, for I beg no favour,"
7428,Henry VI Part 2,18,2.4.94,DUCHESS,Only convey me where thou art commanded.
7429,Henry VI Part 2,19,2.4.95,STANLEY,"Why, madam, that is to the Isle of Man,"
7430,Henry VI Part 2,19,2.4.96,STANLEY,There to be used according to your state.
7431,Henry VI Part 2,20,2.4.97,DUCHESS,"That's bad enough, for I am but reproach:"
7432,Henry VI Part 2,20,2.4.98,DUCHESS,And shall I then be used reproachfully?
7433,Henry VI Part 2,21,2.4.99,STANLEY,"Like to a duchess, and Duke Humphrey's lady,"
7434,Henry VI Part 2,21,2.4.100,STANLEY,According to that state you shall be used.
7435,Henry VI Part 2,22,2.4.101,DUCHESS,"Sheriff, farewell, and better than I fare,"
7436,Henry VI Part 2,22,2.4.102,DUCHESS,Although thou hast been conduct of my shame.
7437,Henry VI Part 2,23,2.4.103,Sheriff,"It is my office, and, madam, pardon me."
7438,Henry VI Part 2,24,2.4.104,DUCHESS,"Ay, ay, farewell, thy office is discharged."
7439,Henry VI Part 2,24,2.4.105,DUCHESS,"Come, Stanley, shall we go?"
7440,Henry VI Part 2,25,2.4.106,STANLEY,"Madam, your penance done, throw off this sheet,"
7441,Henry VI Part 2,25,2.4.107,STANLEY,And go we to attire you for our journey.
7442,Henry VI Part 2,26,2.4.108,DUCHESS,My shame will not be shifted with my sheet:
7443,Henry VI Part 2,26,2.4.109,DUCHESS,"No, it will hang upon my richest robes"
7444,Henry VI Part 2,26,2.4.110,DUCHESS,"And show itself, attire me how I can."
7445,Henry VI Part 2,26,2.4.111,DUCHESS,"Go, lead the way, I long to see my prison."

7448,Henry VI Part 2,26,,DUCHESS,SCENE I. The Abbey at Bury St. Edmund's.
7449,Henry VI Part 2,26,,DUCHESS,"Sound a sennet. Enter KING HENRY VI, QUEEN  MARGARET, CARDINAL, SUFFOLK, YORK, BUCKINGHAM, SALISBURY and WARWICK to the Parliament"
7450,Henry VI Part 2,1,3.1.1,KING HENRY VI,I muse my Lord of Gloucester is not come:
7451,Henry VI Part 2,1,3.1.2,KING HENRY VI,"'Tis not his wont to be the hindmost man,"
7452,Henry VI Part 2,1,3.1.3,KING HENRY VI,Whate'er occasion keeps him from us now.
7453,Henry VI Part 2,2,3.1.4,QUEEN MARGARET,Can you not see? or will ye not observe
7454,Henry VI Part 2,2,3.1.5,QUEEN MARGARET,The strangeness of his alter'd countenance?
7455,Henry VI Part 2,2,3.1.6,QUEEN MARGARET,"With what a majesty he bears himself,"
7456,Henry VI Part 2,2,3.1.7,QUEEN MARGARET,"How insolent of late he is become,"
7457,Henry VI Part 2,2,3.1.8,QUEEN MARGARET,"How proud, how peremptory, and unlike himself?"
7458,Henry VI Part 2,2,3.1.9,QUEEN MARGARET,"We know the time since he was mild and affable,"
7459,Henry VI Part 2,2,3.1.10,QUEEN MARGARET,"And if we did but glance a far-off look,"
7460,Henry VI Part 2,2,3.1.11,QUEEN MARGARET,"Immediately he was upon his knee,"
7461,Henry VI Part 2,2,3.1.12,QUEEN MARGARET,That all the court admired him for submission:
7462,Henry VI Part 2,2,3.1.13,QUEEN MARGARET,"But meet him now, and, be it in the morn,"
7463,Henry VI Part 2,2,3.1.14,QUEEN MARGARET,"When every one will give the time of day,"
7464,Henry VI Part 2,2,3.1.15,QUEEN MARGARET,"He knits his brow and shows an angry eye,"
7465,Henry VI Part 2,2,3.1.16,QUEEN MARGARET,"And passeth by with stiff unbowed knee,"
7466,Henry VI Part 2,2,3.1.17,QUEEN MARGARET,Disdaining duty that to us belongs.
7467,Henry VI Part 2,2,3.1.18,QUEEN MARGARET,"Small curs are not regarded when they grin,"
7468,Henry VI Part 2,2,3.1.19,QUEEN MARGARET,"But great men tremble when the lion roars,"
7469,Henry VI Part 2,2,3.1.20,QUEEN MARGARET,And Humphrey is no little man in England.
7470,Henry VI Part 2,2,3.1.21,QUEEN MARGARET,"First note that he is near you in descent,"
7471,Henry VI Part 2,2,3.1.22,QUEEN MARGARET,"And should you fall, he as the next will mount."
7472,Henry VI Part 2,2,3.1.23,QUEEN MARGARET,"Me seemeth then it is no policy,"
7473,Henry VI Part 2,2,3.1.24,QUEEN MARGARET,Respecting what a rancorous mind he bears
7474,Henry VI Part 2,2,3.1.25,QUEEN MARGARET,"And his advantage following your decease,"
7475,Henry VI Part 2,2,3.1.26,QUEEN MARGARET,That he should come about your royal person
7476,Henry VI Part 2,2,3.1.27,QUEEN MARGARET,Or be admitted to your highness' council.
7477,Henry VI Part 2,2,3.1.28,QUEEN MARGARET,"By flattery hath he won the commons' hearts,"
7478,Henry VI Part 2,2,3.1.29,QUEEN MARGARET,"And when he please to make commotion,"
7479,Henry VI Part 2,2,3.1.30,QUEEN MARGARET,'Tis to be fear'd they all will follow him.
7480,Henry VI Part 2,2,3.1.31,QUEEN MARGARET,"Now 'tis the spring, and weeds are shallow-rooted,"
7481,Henry VI Part 2,2,3.1.32,QUEEN MARGARET,"Suffer them now, and they'll o'ergrow the garden"
7482,Henry VI Part 2,2,3.1.33,QUEEN MARGARET,And choke the herbs for want of husbandry.
7483,Henry VI Part 2,2,3.1.34,QUEEN MARGARET,The reverent care I bear unto my lord
7484,Henry VI Part 2,2,3.1.35,QUEEN MARGARET,Made me collect these dangers in the duke.
7485,Henry VI Part 2,2,3.1.36,QUEEN MARGARET,"If it be fond, call it a woman's fear,"
7486,Henry VI Part 2,2,3.1.37,QUEEN MARGARET,"Which fear if better reasons can supplant,"
7487,Henry VI Part 2,2,3.1.38,QUEEN MARGARET,I will subscribe and say I wrong'd the duke.
7488,Henry VI Part 2,2,3.1.39,QUEEN MARGARET,"My Lord of Suffolk, Buckingham, and York,"
7489,Henry VI Part 2,2,3.1.40,QUEEN MARGARET,"Reprove my allegation, if you can,"
7490,Henry VI Part 2,2,3.1.41,QUEEN MARGARET,Or else conclude my words effectual.
7491,Henry VI Part 2,3,3.1.42,SUFFOLK,"Well hath your highness seen into this duke,"
7492,Henry VI Part 2,3,3.1.43,SUFFOLK,"And, had I first been put to speak my mind,"
7493,Henry VI Part 2,3,3.1.44,SUFFOLK,I think I should have told your grace's tale.
7494,Henry VI Part 2,3,3.1.45,SUFFOLK,"The duchess, by his subornation,"
7495,Henry VI Part 2,3,3.1.46,SUFFOLK,"Upon my life, began her devilish practises:"
7496,Henry VI Part 2,3,3.1.47,SUFFOLK,"Or, if he were not privy to those faults,"
7497,Henry VI Part 2,3,3.1.48,SUFFOLK,"Yet, by reputing of his high descent,"
7498,Henry VI Part 2,3,3.1.49,SUFFOLK,"As next the king he was successive heir,"
7499,Henry VI Part 2,3,3.1.50,SUFFOLK,"And such high vaunts of his nobility,"
7500,Henry VI Part 2,3,3.1.51,SUFFOLK,Did instigate the bedlam brain-sick duchess
7501,Henry VI Part 2,3,3.1.52,SUFFOLK,By wicked means to frame our sovereign's fall.
7502,Henry VI Part 2,3,3.1.53,SUFFOLK,"Smooth runs the water where the brook is deep,"
7503,Henry VI Part 2,3,3.1.54,SUFFOLK,And in his simple show he harbours treason.
7504,Henry VI Part 2,3,3.1.55,SUFFOLK,The fox barks not when he would steal the lamb.
7505,Henry VI Part 2,3,3.1.56,SUFFOLK,"No, no, my sovereign, Gloucester is a man"
7506,Henry VI Part 2,3,3.1.57,SUFFOLK,Unsounded yet and full of deep deceit.
7507,Henry VI Part 2,4,3.1.58,CARDINAL,"Did he not, contrary to form of law,"
7508,Henry VI Part 2,4,3.1.59,CARDINAL,Devise strange deaths for small offences done?
7509,Henry VI Part 2,5,3.1.60,YORK,"And did he not, in his protectorship,"
7510,Henry VI Part 2,5,3.1.61,YORK,Levy great sums of money through the realm
7511,Henry VI Part 2,5,3.1.62,YORK,"For soldiers' pay in France, and never sent it?"
7512,Henry VI Part 2,5,3.1.63,YORK,By means whereof the towns each day revolted.
7513,Henry VI Part 2,6,3.1.64,BUCKINGHAM,"Tut, these are petty faults to faults unknown."
7514,Henry VI Part 2,6,3.1.65,BUCKINGHAM,Which time will bring to light in smooth
7515,Henry VI Part 2,6,3.1.66,BUCKINGHAM,Duke Humphrey.
7516,Henry VI Part 2,7,3.1.67,KING HENRY VI,"My lords, at once: the care you have of us,"
7517,Henry VI Part 2,7,3.1.68,KING HENRY VI,"To mow down thorns that would annoy our foot,"
7518,Henry VI Part 2,7,3.1.69,KING HENRY VI,"Is worthy praise: but, shall I speak my conscience,"
7519,Henry VI Part 2,7,3.1.70,KING HENRY VI,Our kinsman Gloucester is as innocent
7520,Henry VI Part 2,7,3.1.71,KING HENRY VI,From meaning treason to our royal person
7521,Henry VI Part 2,7,3.1.72,KING HENRY VI,As is the sucking lamb or harmless dove:
7522,Henry VI Part 2,7,3.1.73,KING HENRY VI,"The duke is virtuous, mild and too well given"
7523,Henry VI Part 2,7,3.1.74,KING HENRY VI,To dream on evil or to work my downfall.
7524,Henry VI Part 2,8,3.1.75,QUEEN MARGARET,"Ah, what's more dangerous than this fond affiance!"
7525,Henry VI Part 2,8,3.1.76,QUEEN MARGARET,"Seems he a dove? his feathers are but borrowed,"
7526,Henry VI Part 2,8,3.1.77,QUEEN MARGARET,For he's disposed as the hateful raven:
7527,Henry VI Part 2,8,3.1.78,QUEEN MARGARET,"Is he a lamb? his skin is surely lent him,"
7528,Henry VI Part 2,8,3.1.79,QUEEN MARGARET,For he's inclined as is the ravenous wolf.
7529,Henry VI Part 2,8,3.1.80,QUEEN MARGARET,Who cannot steal a shape that means deceit?
7530,Henry VI Part 2,8,3.1.81,QUEEN MARGARET,"Take heed, my lord, the welfare of us all"
7531,Henry VI Part 2,8,3.1.82,QUEEN MARGARET,Hangs on the cutting short that fraudful man.
7532,Henry VI Part 2,8,,QUEEN MARGARET,Enter SOMERSET
7533,Henry VI Part 2,9,3.1.83,SOMERSET,All health unto my gracious sovereign!
7534,Henry VI Part 2,10,3.1.84,KING HENRY VI,"Welcome, Lord Somerset. What news from France?"
7535,Henry VI Part 2,11,3.1.85,SOMERSET,That all your interest in those territories
7536,Henry VI Part 2,11,3.1.86,SOMERSET,"Is utterly bereft you, all is lost."
7537,Henry VI Part 2,12,3.1.87,KING HENRY VI,"Cold news, Lord Somerset: but God's will be done!"
7538,Henry VI Part 2,13,3.1.88,YORK,"[Aside]  Cold news for me, for I had hope of France"
7539,Henry VI Part 2,13,3.1.89,YORK,As firmly as I hope for fertile England.
7540,Henry VI Part 2,13,3.1.90,YORK,Thus are my blossoms blasted in the bud
7541,Henry VI Part 2,13,3.1.91,YORK,"And caterpillars eat my leaves away,"
7542,Henry VI Part 2,13,3.1.92,YORK,"But I will remedy this gear ere long,"
7543,Henry VI Part 2,13,3.1.93,YORK,Or sell my title for a glorious grave.
7544,Henry VI Part 2,13,,YORK,Enter GLOUCESTER
7545,Henry VI Part 2,14,3.1.94,GLOUCESTER,All happiness unto my lord the king!
7546,Henry VI Part 2,14,3.1.95,GLOUCESTER,"Pardon, my liege, that I have stay'd so long."
7547,Henry VI Part 2,15,3.1.96,SUFFOLK,"Nay, Gloucester, know that thou art come too soon,"
7548,Henry VI Part 2,15,3.1.97,SUFFOLK,Unless thou wert more loyal than thou art:
7549,Henry VI Part 2,15,3.1.98,SUFFOLK,I do arrest thee of high treason here.
7550,Henry VI Part 2,16,3.1.99,GLOUCESTER,"Well, Suffolk, thou shalt not see me blush"
7551,Henry VI Part 2,16,3.1.100,GLOUCESTER,Nor change my countenance for this arrest:
7552,Henry VI Part 2,16,3.1.101,GLOUCESTER,A heart unspotted is not easily daunted.
7553,Henry VI Part 2,16,3.1.102,GLOUCESTER,The purest spring is not so free from mud
7554,Henry VI Part 2,16,3.1.103,GLOUCESTER,As I am clear from treason to my sovereign:
7555,Henry VI Part 2,16,3.1.104,GLOUCESTER,Who can accuse me? wherein am I guilty?
7556,Henry VI Part 2,17,3.1.105,YORK,"'Tis thought, my lord, that you took bribes of France,"
7557,Henry VI Part 2,17,3.1.106,YORK,"And, being protector, stayed the soldiers' pay,"
7558,Henry VI Part 2,17,3.1.107,YORK,By means whereof his highness hath lost France.
7559,Henry VI Part 2,18,3.1.108,GLOUCESTER,Is it but thought so? what are they that think it?
7560,Henry VI Part 2,18,3.1.109,GLOUCESTER,"I never robb'd the soldiers of their pay,"
7561,Henry VI Part 2,18,3.1.110,GLOUCESTER,Nor ever had one penny bribe from France.
7562,Henry VI Part 2,18,3.1.111,GLOUCESTER,"So help me God, as I have watch'd the night,"
7563,Henry VI Part 2,18,3.1.112,GLOUCESTER,"Ay, night by night, in studying good for England,"
7564,Henry VI Part 2,18,3.1.113,GLOUCESTER,"That doit that e'er I wrested from the king,"
7565,Henry VI Part 2,18,3.1.114,GLOUCESTER,"Or any groat I hoarded to my use,"
7566,Henry VI Part 2,18,3.1.115,GLOUCESTER,Be brought against me at my trial-day!
7567,Henry VI Part 2,18,3.1.116,GLOUCESTER,"No, many a pound of mine own proper store,"
7568,Henry VI Part 2,18,3.1.117,GLOUCESTER,"Because I would not tax the needy commons,"
7569,Henry VI Part 2,18,3.1.118,GLOUCESTER,"Have I disbursed to the garrisons,"
7570,Henry VI Part 2,18,3.1.119,GLOUCESTER,And never ask'd for restitution.
7571,Henry VI Part 2,19,3.1.120,CARDINAL,"It serves you well, my lord, to say so much."
7572,Henry VI Part 2,20,3.1.121,GLOUCESTER,"I say no more than truth, so help me God!"
7573,Henry VI Part 2,21,3.1.122,YORK,In your protectorship you did devise
7574,Henry VI Part 2,21,3.1.123,YORK,"Strange tortures for offenders never heard of,"
7575,Henry VI Part 2,21,3.1.124,YORK,That England was defamed by tyranny.
7576,Henry VI Part 2,22,3.1.125,GLOUCESTER,"Why, 'tis well known that, whiles I was"
7577,Henry VI Part 2,22,3.1.126,GLOUCESTER,"protector,"
7578,Henry VI Part 2,22,3.1.127,GLOUCESTER,"Pity was all the fault that was in me,"
7579,Henry VI Part 2,22,3.1.128,GLOUCESTER,"For I should melt at an offender's tears,"
7580,Henry VI Part 2,22,3.1.129,GLOUCESTER,And lowly words were ransom for their fault.
7581,Henry VI Part 2,22,3.1.130,GLOUCESTER,"Unless it were a bloody murderer,"
7582,Henry VI Part 2,22,3.1.131,GLOUCESTER,"Or foul felonious thief that fleeced poor passengers,"
7583,Henry VI Part 2,22,3.1.132,GLOUCESTER,I never gave them condign punishment:
7584,Henry VI Part 2,22,3.1.133,GLOUCESTER,"Murder indeed, that bloody sin, I tortured"
7585,Henry VI Part 2,22,3.1.134,GLOUCESTER,Above the felon or what trespass else.
7586,Henry VI Part 2,23,3.1.135,SUFFOLK,"My lord, these faults are easy, quickly answered:"
7587,Henry VI Part 2,23,3.1.136,SUFFOLK,"But mightier crimes are laid unto your charge,"
7588,Henry VI Part 2,23,3.1.137,SUFFOLK,Whereof you cannot easily purge yourself.
7589,Henry VI Part 2,23,3.1.138,SUFFOLK,"I do arrest you in his highness' name,"
7590,Henry VI Part 2,23,3.1.139,SUFFOLK,And here commit you to my lord cardinal
7591,Henry VI Part 2,23,3.1.140,SUFFOLK,"To keep, until your further time of trial."
7592,Henry VI Part 2,24,3.1.141,KING HENRY VI,"My lord of Gloucester, 'tis my special hope"
7593,Henry VI Part 2,24,3.1.142,KING HENRY VI,That you will clear yourself from all suspect:
7594,Henry VI Part 2,24,3.1.143,KING HENRY VI,My conscience tells me you are innocent.
7595,Henry VI Part 2,25,3.1.144,GLOUCESTER,"Ah, gracious lord, these days are dangerous:"
7596,Henry VI Part 2,25,3.1.145,GLOUCESTER,Virtue is choked with foul ambition
7597,Henry VI Part 2,25,3.1.146,GLOUCESTER,"And charity chased hence by rancour's hand,"
7598,Henry VI Part 2,25,3.1.147,GLOUCESTER,Foul subornation is predominant
7599,Henry VI Part 2,25,3.1.148,GLOUCESTER,And equity exiled your highness' land.
7600,Henry VI Part 2,25,3.1.149,GLOUCESTER,"I know their complot is to have my life,"
7601,Henry VI Part 2,25,3.1.150,GLOUCESTER,"And if my death might make this island happy,"
7602,Henry VI Part 2,25,3.1.151,GLOUCESTER,"And prove the period of their tyranny,"
7603,Henry VI Part 2,25,3.1.152,GLOUCESTER,I would expend it with all willingness:
7604,Henry VI Part 2,25,3.1.153,GLOUCESTER,"But mine is made the prologue to their play,"
7605,Henry VI Part 2,25,3.1.154,GLOUCESTER,"For thousands more, that yet suspect no peril,"
7606,Henry VI Part 2,25,3.1.155,GLOUCESTER,Will not conclude their plotted tragedy.
7607,Henry VI Part 2,25,3.1.156,GLOUCESTER,"Beaufort's red sparkling eyes blab his heart's malice,"
7608,Henry VI Part 2,25,3.1.157,GLOUCESTER,"And Suffolk's cloudy brow his stormy hate,"
7609,Henry VI Part 2,25,3.1.158,GLOUCESTER,Sharp Buckingham unburthens with his tongue
7610,Henry VI Part 2,25,3.1.159,GLOUCESTER,"The envious load that lies upon his heart,"
7611,Henry VI Part 2,25,3.1.160,GLOUCESTER,"And dogged York, that reaches at the moon,"
7612,Henry VI Part 2,25,3.1.161,GLOUCESTER,"Whose overweening arm I have pluck'd back,"
7613,Henry VI Part 2,25,3.1.162,GLOUCESTER,By false accuse doth level at my life:
7614,Henry VI Part 2,25,3.1.163,GLOUCESTER,"And you, my sovereign lady, with the rest,"
7615,Henry VI Part 2,25,3.1.164,GLOUCESTER,"Causeless have laid disgraces on my head,"
7616,Henry VI Part 2,25,3.1.165,GLOUCESTER,And with your best endeavour have stirr'd up
7617,Henry VI Part 2,25,3.1.166,GLOUCESTER,My liefest liege to be mine enemy:
7618,Henry VI Part 2,25,3.1.167,GLOUCESTER,"Ay, all you have laid your heads together--"
7619,Henry VI Part 2,25,3.1.168,GLOUCESTER,Myself had notice of your conventicles--
7620,Henry VI Part 2,25,3.1.169,GLOUCESTER,And all to make away my guiltless life.
7621,Henry VI Part 2,25,3.1.170,GLOUCESTER,"I shall not want false witness to condemn me,"
7622,Henry VI Part 2,25,3.1.171,GLOUCESTER,"Nor store of treasons to augment my guilt,"
7623,Henry VI Part 2,25,3.1.172,GLOUCESTER,The ancient proverb will be well effected:
7624,Henry VI Part 2,25,3.1.173,GLOUCESTER,'A staff is quickly found to beat a dog.'
7625,Henry VI Part 2,26,3.1.174,CARDINAL,"My liege, his railing is intolerable:"
7626,Henry VI Part 2,26,3.1.175,CARDINAL,If those that care to keep your royal person
7627,Henry VI Part 2,26,3.1.176,CARDINAL,From treason's secret knife and traitors' rage
7628,Henry VI Part 2,26,3.1.177,CARDINAL,"Be thus upbraided, chid and rated at,"
7629,Henry VI Part 2,26,3.1.178,CARDINAL,"And the offender granted scope of speech,"
7630,Henry VI Part 2,26,3.1.179,CARDINAL,'Twill make them cool in zeal unto your grace.
7631,Henry VI Part 2,27,3.1.180,SUFFOLK,Hath he not twit our sovereign lady here
7632,Henry VI Part 2,27,3.1.181,SUFFOLK,"With ignominious words, though clerkly couch'd,"
7633,Henry VI Part 2,27,3.1.182,SUFFOLK,As if she had suborned some to swear
7634,Henry VI Part 2,27,3.1.183,SUFFOLK,False allegations to o'erthrow his state?
7635,Henry VI Part 2,28,3.1.184,QUEEN MARGARET,But I can give the loser leave to chide.
7636,Henry VI Part 2,29,3.1.185,GLOUCESTER,"Far truer spoke than meant: I lose, indeed,"
7637,Henry VI Part 2,29,3.1.186,GLOUCESTER,"Beshrew the winners, for they play'd me false!"
7638,Henry VI Part 2,29,3.1.187,GLOUCESTER,And well such losers may have leave to speak.
7639,Henry VI Part 2,30,3.1.188,BUCKINGHAM,He'll wrest the sense and hold us here all day:
7640,Henry VI Part 2,30,3.1.189,BUCKINGHAM,"Lord cardinal, he is your prisoner."
7641,Henry VI Part 2,31,3.1.190,CARDINAL,"Sirs, take away the duke, and guard him sure."
7642,Henry VI Part 2,32,3.1.191,GLOUCESTER,Ah! thus King Henry throws away his crutch
7643,Henry VI Part 2,32,3.1.192,GLOUCESTER,Before his legs be firm to bear his body.
7644,Henry VI Part 2,32,3.1.193,GLOUCESTER,"Thus is the shepherd beaten from thy side,"
7645,Henry VI Part 2,32,3.1.194,GLOUCESTER,And wolves are gnarling who shall gnaw thee first.
7646,Henry VI Part 2,32,3.1.195,GLOUCESTER,"Ah, that my fear were false! ah, that it were!"
7647,Henry VI Part 2,32,3.1.196,GLOUCESTER,"For, good King Henry, thy decay I fear."
7648,Henry VI Part 2,32,,GLOUCESTER,"Exit, guarded"
7649,Henry VI Part 2,33,3.1.197,KING HENRY VI,"My lords, what to your wisdoms seemeth best,"
7650,Henry VI Part 2,33,3.1.198,KING HENRY VI,"Do or undo, as if ourself were here."
7651,Henry VI Part 2,34,3.1.199,QUEEN MARGARET,"What, will your highness leave the parliament?"
7652,Henry VI Part 2,35,3.1.200,KING HENRY VI,"Ay, Margaret, my heart is drown'd with grief,"
7653,Henry VI Part 2,35,3.1.201,KING HENRY VI,"Whose flood begins to flow within mine eyes,"
7654,Henry VI Part 2,35,3.1.202,KING HENRY VI,"My body round engirt with misery,"
7655,Henry VI Part 2,35,3.1.203,KING HENRY VI,For what's more miserable than discontent?
7656,Henry VI Part 2,35,3.1.204,KING HENRY VI,"Ah, uncle Humphrey! in thy face I see"
7657,Henry VI Part 2,35,3.1.205,KING HENRY VI,"The map of honour, truth and loyalty:"
7658,Henry VI Part 2,35,3.1.206,KING HENRY VI,"And yet, good Humphrey, is the hour to come"
7659,Henry VI Part 2,35,3.1.207,KING HENRY VI,That e'er I proved thee false or fear'd thy faith.
7660,Henry VI Part 2,35,3.1.208,KING HENRY VI,"What louring star now envies thy estate,"
7661,Henry VI Part 2,35,3.1.209,KING HENRY VI,That these great lords and Margaret our queen
7662,Henry VI Part 2,35,3.1.210,KING HENRY VI,Do seek subversion of thy harmless life?
7663,Henry VI Part 2,35,3.1.211,KING HENRY VI,"Thou never didst them wrong, nor no man wrong,"
7664,Henry VI Part 2,35,3.1.212,KING HENRY VI,And as the butcher takes away the calf
7665,Henry VI Part 2,35,3.1.213,KING HENRY VI,"And binds the wretch, and beats it when it strays,"
7666,Henry VI Part 2,35,3.1.214,KING HENRY VI,"Bearing it to the bloody slaughter-house,"
7667,Henry VI Part 2,35,3.1.215,KING HENRY VI,"Even so remorseless have they borne him hence,"
7668,Henry VI Part 2,35,3.1.216,KING HENRY VI,"And as the dam runs lowing up and down,"
7669,Henry VI Part 2,35,3.1.217,KING HENRY VI,"Looking the way her harmless young one went,"
7670,Henry VI Part 2,35,3.1.218,KING HENRY VI,"And can do nought but wail her darling's loss,"
7671,Henry VI Part 2,35,3.1.219,KING HENRY VI,Even so myself bewails good Gloucester's case
7672,Henry VI Part 2,35,3.1.220,KING HENRY VI,"With sad unhelpful tears, and with dimm'd eyes"
7673,Henry VI Part 2,35,3.1.221,KING HENRY VI,"Look after him and cannot do him good,"
7674,Henry VI Part 2,35,3.1.222,KING HENRY VI,So mighty are his vowed enemies.
7675,Henry VI Part 2,35,3.1.223,KING HENRY VI,"His fortunes I will weep, and, 'twixt each groan"
7676,Henry VI Part 2,35,3.1.224,KING HENRY VI,Say 'Who's a traitor? Gloucester he is none.'
7677,Henry VI Part 2,35,3.1.224,KING HENRY VI,"Exeunt all but QUEEN MARGARET, CARDINAL, SUFFOLK, and YORK, SOMERSET remains apart"
7678,Henry VI Part 2,36,3.1.225,QUEEN MARGARET,"Free lords, cold snow melts with the sun's hot beams."
7679,Henry VI Part 2,36,3.1.226,QUEEN MARGARET,"Henry my lord is cold in great affairs,"
7680,Henry VI Part 2,36,3.1.227,QUEEN MARGARET,"Too full of foolish pity, and Gloucester's show"
7681,Henry VI Part 2,36,3.1.228,QUEEN MARGARET,Beguiles him as the mournful crocodile
7682,Henry VI Part 2,36,3.1.229,QUEEN MARGARET,"With sorrow snares relenting passengers,"
7683,Henry VI Part 2,36,3.1.230,QUEEN MARGARET,"Or as the snake roll'd in a flowering bank,"
7684,Henry VI Part 2,36,3.1.231,QUEEN MARGARET,"With shining chequer'd slough, doth sting a child"
7685,Henry VI Part 2,36,3.1.232,QUEEN MARGARET,That for the beauty thinks it excellent.
7686,Henry VI Part 2,36,3.1.233,QUEEN MARGARET,"Believe me, lords, were none more wise than I--"
7687,Henry VI Part 2,36,3.1.234,QUEEN MARGARET,And yet herein I judge mine own wit good--
7688,Henry VI Part 2,36,3.1.235,QUEEN MARGARET,"This Gloucester should be quickly rid the world,"
7689,Henry VI Part 2,36,3.1.236,QUEEN MARGARET,To rid us of the fear we have of him.
7690,Henry VI Part 2,37,3.1.237,CARDINAL,"That he should die is worthy policy,"
7691,Henry VI Part 2,37,3.1.238,CARDINAL,But yet we want a colour for his death:
7692,Henry VI Part 2,37,3.1.239,CARDINAL,'Tis meet he be condemn'd by course of law.
7693,Henry VI Part 2,38,3.1.240,SUFFOLK,"But, in my mind, that were no policy:"
7694,Henry VI Part 2,38,3.1.241,SUFFOLK,"The king will labour still to save his life,"
7695,Henry VI Part 2,38,3.1.242,SUFFOLK,"The commons haply rise, to save his life,"
7696,Henry VI Part 2,38,3.1.243,SUFFOLK,"And yet we have but trivial argument,"
7697,Henry VI Part 2,38,3.1.244,SUFFOLK,"More than mistrust, that shows him worthy death."
7698,Henry VI Part 2,39,3.1.245,YORK,"So that, by this, you would not have him die."
7699,Henry VI Part 2,40,3.1.246,SUFFOLK,"Ah, York, no man alive so fain as I!"
7700,Henry VI Part 2,41,3.1.247,YORK,'Tis York that hath more reason for his death.
7701,Henry VI Part 2,41,3.1.248,YORK,"But, my lord cardinal, and you, my Lord of Suffolk,"
7702,Henry VI Part 2,41,3.1.249,YORK,"Say as you think, and speak it from your souls,"
7703,Henry VI Part 2,41,3.1.250,YORK,"Were't not all one, an empty eagle were set"
7704,Henry VI Part 2,41,3.1.251,YORK,"To guard the chicken from a hungry kite,"
7705,Henry VI Part 2,41,3.1.252,YORK,As place Duke Humphrey for the king's protector?
7706,Henry VI Part 2,42,3.1.253,QUEEN MARGARET,So the poor chicken should be sure of death.
7707,Henry VI Part 2,43,3.1.254,SUFFOLK,"Madam, 'tis true, and were't not madness, then,"
7708,Henry VI Part 2,43,3.1.255,SUFFOLK,To make the fox surveyor of the fold?
7709,Henry VI Part 2,43,3.1.256,SUFFOLK,"Who being accused a crafty murderer,"
7710,Henry VI Part 2,43,3.1.257,SUFFOLK,"His guilt should be but idly posted over,"
7711,Henry VI Part 2,43,3.1.258,SUFFOLK,Because his purpose is not executed.
7712,Henry VI Part 2,43,3.1.259,SUFFOLK,"No, let him die, in that he is a fox,"
7713,Henry VI Part 2,43,3.1.260,SUFFOLK,"By nature proved an enemy to the flock,"
7714,Henry VI Part 2,43,3.1.261,SUFFOLK,"Before his chaps be stain'd with crimson blood,"
7715,Henry VI Part 2,43,3.1.262,SUFFOLK,"As Humphrey, proved by reasons, to my liege."
7716,Henry VI Part 2,43,3.1.263,SUFFOLK,And do not stand on quillets how to slay him:
7717,Henry VI Part 2,43,3.1.264,SUFFOLK,"Be it by gins, by snares, by subtlety,"
7718,Henry VI Part 2,43,3.1.265,SUFFOLK,"Sleeping or waking, 'tis no matter how,"
7719,Henry VI Part 2,43,3.1.266,SUFFOLK,"So he be dead, for that is good deceit"
7720,Henry VI Part 2,43,3.1.267,SUFFOLK,Which mates him first that first intends deceit.
7721,Henry VI Part 2,44,3.1.268,QUEEN MARGARET,"Thrice-noble Suffolk, 'tis resolutely spoke."
7722,Henry VI Part 2,45,3.1.269,SUFFOLK,"Not resolute, except so much were done,"
7723,Henry VI Part 2,45,3.1.270,SUFFOLK,For things are often spoke and seldom meant:
7724,Henry VI Part 2,45,3.1.271,SUFFOLK,"But that my heart accordeth with my tongue,"
7725,Henry VI Part 2,45,3.1.272,SUFFOLK,"Seeing the deed is meritorious,"
7726,Henry VI Part 2,45,3.1.273,SUFFOLK,"And to preserve my sovereign from his foe,"
7727,Henry VI Part 2,45,3.1.274,SUFFOLK,"Say but the word, and I will be his priest."
7728,Henry VI Part 2,46,3.1.275,CARDINAL,"But I would have him dead, my Lord of Suffolk,"
7729,Henry VI Part 2,46,3.1.276,CARDINAL,Ere you can take due orders for a priest:

7731,Henry VI Part 2,46,3.1.278,CARDINAL,"And I'll provide his executioner,"
7732,Henry VI Part 2,46,3.1.279,CARDINAL,I tender so the safety of my liege.
7733,Henry VI Part 2,47,3.1.280,SUFFOLK,"Here is my hand, the deed is worthy doing."
7734,Henry VI Part 2,48,3.1.281,QUEEN MARGARET,And so say I.
7735,Henry VI Part 2,49,3.1.282,YORK,"And I    and now we three have spoke it,"
7736,Henry VI Part 2,49,3.1.283,YORK,It skills not greatly who impugns our doom.
7737,Henry VI Part 2,49,,YORK,Enter a Post
7738,Henry VI Part 2,50,3.1.284,Post,"Great lords, from Ireland am I come amain,"
7739,Henry VI Part 2,50,3.1.285,Post,To signify that rebels there are up
7740,Henry VI Part 2,50,3.1.286,Post,And put the Englishmen unto the sword:
7741,Henry VI Part 2,50,3.1.287,Post,"Send succors, lords, and stop the rage betime,"
7742,Henry VI Part 2,50,3.1.288,Post,"Before the wound do grow uncurable,"
7743,Henry VI Part 2,50,3.1.289,Post,"For, being green, there is great hope of help."
7744,Henry VI Part 2,51,3.1.290,CARDINAL,A breach that craves a quick expedient stop!
7745,Henry VI Part 2,51,3.1.291,CARDINAL,What counsel give you in this weighty cause?
7746,Henry VI Part 2,52,3.1.292,YORK,That Somerset be sent as regent thither:
7747,Henry VI Part 2,52,3.1.293,YORK,"'Tis meet that lucky ruler be employ'd,"
7748,Henry VI Part 2,52,3.1.294,YORK,Witness the fortune he hath had in France.
7749,Henry VI Part 2,53,3.1.295,SOMERSET,"If York, with all his far-fet policy,"
7750,Henry VI Part 2,53,3.1.296,SOMERSET,"Had been the regent there instead of me,"
7751,Henry VI Part 2,53,3.1.297,SOMERSET,He never would have stay'd in France so long.
7752,Henry VI Part 2,54,3.1.298,YORK,"No, not to lose it all, as thou hast done:"
7753,Henry VI Part 2,54,3.1.299,YORK,I rather would have lost my life betimes
7754,Henry VI Part 2,54,3.1.300,YORK,Than bring a burthen of dishonour home
7755,Henry VI Part 2,54,3.1.301,YORK,By staying there so long till all were lost.
7756,Henry VI Part 2,54,3.1.302,YORK,Show me one scar character'd on thy skin:
7757,Henry VI Part 2,54,3.1.303,YORK,Men's flesh preserved so whole do seldom win.
7758,Henry VI Part 2,55,3.1.304,QUEEN MARGARET,"Nay, then, this spark will prove a raging fire,"
7759,Henry VI Part 2,55,3.1.305,QUEEN MARGARET,If wind and fuel be brought to feed it with:
7760,Henry VI Part 2,55,3.1.306,QUEEN MARGARET,"No more, good York, sweet Somerset, be still:"
7761,Henry VI Part 2,55,3.1.307,QUEEN MARGARET,"Thy fortune, York, hadst thou been regent there,"
7762,Henry VI Part 2,55,3.1.308,QUEEN MARGARET,Might happily have proved far worse than his.
7763,Henry VI Part 2,56,3.1.309,YORK,"What, worse than nought? nay, then, a shame take all!"
7764,Henry VI Part 2,57,3.1.310,SOMERSET,"And, in the number, thee that wishest shame!"
7765,Henry VI Part 2,58,3.1.311,CARDINAL,"My Lord of York, try what your fortune is."
7766,Henry VI Part 2,58,3.1.312,CARDINAL,The uncivil kerns of Ireland are in arms
7767,Henry VI Part 2,58,3.1.313,CARDINAL,And temper clay with blood of Englishmen:

7769,Henry VI Part 2,58,3.1.315,CARDINAL,"Collected choicely, from each county some,"
7770,Henry VI Part 2,58,3.1.316,CARDINAL,And try your hap against the Irishmen?
7771,Henry VI Part 2,59,3.1.317,YORK,"I will, my lord, so please his majesty."
7772,Henry VI Part 2,60,3.1.318,SUFFOLK,"Why, our authority is his consent,"
7773,Henry VI Part 2,60,3.1.319,SUFFOLK,And what we do establish he confirms:
7774,Henry VI Part 2,60,3.1.320,SUFFOLK,"Then, noble York, take thou this task in hand."
7775,Henry VI Part 2,61,3.1.321,YORK,"I am content: provide me soldiers, lords,"
7776,Henry VI Part 2,61,3.1.322,YORK,Whiles I take order for mine own affairs.
7777,Henry VI Part 2,62,3.1.323,SUFFOLK,"A charge, Lord York, that I will see perform'd."
7778,Henry VI Part 2,62,3.1.324,SUFFOLK,But now return we to the false Duke Humphrey.
7779,Henry VI Part 2,63,3.1.325,CARDINAL,"No more of him, for I will deal with him"
7780,Henry VI Part 2,63,3.1.326,CARDINAL,That henceforth he shall trouble us no more.
7781,Henry VI Part 2,63,3.1.327,CARDINAL,"And so break off, the day is almost spent:"
7782,Henry VI Part 2,63,3.1.328,CARDINAL,"Lord Suffolk, you and I must talk of that event."
7783,Henry VI Part 2,64,3.1.329,YORK,"My Lord of Suffolk, within fourteen days"
7784,Henry VI Part 2,64,3.1.330,YORK,"At Bristol I expect my soldiers,"
7785,Henry VI Part 2,64,3.1.331,YORK,For there I'll ship them all for Ireland.
7786,Henry VI Part 2,65,3.1.332,SUFFOLK,"I'll see it truly done, my Lord of York."

7789,Henry VI Part 2,66,3.1.334,YORK,And change misdoubt to resolution:
7790,Henry VI Part 2,66,3.1.335,YORK,"Be that thou hopest to be, or what thou art"
7791,Henry VI Part 2,66,3.1.336,YORK,"Resign to death, it is not worth the enjoying:"
7792,Henry VI Part 2,66,3.1.337,YORK,"Let pale-faced fear keep with the mean-born man,"
7793,Henry VI Part 2,66,3.1.338,YORK,And find no harbour in a royal heart.
7794,Henry VI Part 2,66,3.1.339,YORK,Faster than spring-time showers comes thought
7795,Henry VI Part 2,66,3.1.340,YORK,"on thought,"
7796,Henry VI Part 2,66,3.1.341,YORK,And not a thought but thinks on dignity.
7797,Henry VI Part 2,66,3.1.342,YORK,My brain more busy than the labouring spider
7798,Henry VI Part 2,66,3.1.343,YORK,Weaves tedious snares to trap mine enemies.
7799,Henry VI Part 2,66,3.1.344,YORK,"Well, nobles, well, 'tis politicly done,"
7800,Henry VI Part 2,66,3.1.345,YORK,To send me packing with an host of men:
7801,Henry VI Part 2,66,3.1.346,YORK,"I fear me you but warm the starved snake,"
7802,Henry VI Part 2,66,3.1.347,YORK,"Who, cherish'd in your breasts, will sting"
7803,Henry VI Part 2,66,3.1.348,YORK,your hearts.
7804,Henry VI Part 2,66,3.1.349,YORK,'Twas men I lack'd and you will give them me:

7807,Henry VI Part 2,66,3.1.352,YORK,"Whiles I in Ireland nourish a mighty band,"
7808,Henry VI Part 2,66,3.1.353,YORK,I will stir up in England some black storm
7809,Henry VI Part 2,66,3.1.354,YORK,"Shall blow ten thousand souls to heaven or hell,"
7810,Henry VI Part 2,66,3.1.355,YORK,And this fell tempest shall not cease to rage
7811,Henry VI Part 2,66,3.1.356,YORK,"Until the golden circuit on my head,"
7812,Henry VI Part 2,66,3.1.357,YORK,"Like to the glorious sun's transparent beams,"
7813,Henry VI Part 2,66,3.1.358,YORK,Do calm the fury of this mad-bred flaw.
7814,Henry VI Part 2,66,3.1.359,YORK,"And, for a minister of my intent,"
7815,Henry VI Part 2,66,3.1.360,YORK,"I have seduced a headstrong Kentishman,"
7816,Henry VI Part 2,66,3.1.361,YORK,"John Cade of Ashford,"
7817,Henry VI Part 2,66,3.1.362,YORK,"To make commotion, as full well he can,"
7818,Henry VI Part 2,66,3.1.363,YORK,Under the title of John Mortimer.
7819,Henry VI Part 2,66,3.1.364,YORK,In Ireland have I seen this stubborn Cade
7820,Henry VI Part 2,66,3.1.365,YORK,"Oppose himself against a troop of kerns,"
7821,Henry VI Part 2,66,3.1.366,YORK,"And fought so long, till that his thighs with darts"
7822,Henry VI Part 2,66,3.1.367,YORK,"Were almost like a sharp-quill'd porpentine,"
7823,Henry VI Part 2,66,3.1.368,YORK,"And, in the end being rescued, I have seen"
7824,Henry VI Part 2,66,3.1.369,YORK,"Him caper upright like a wild Morisco,"
7825,Henry VI Part 2,66,3.1.370,YORK,Shaking the bloody darts as he his bells.
7826,Henry VI Part 2,66,3.1.371,YORK,"Full often, like a shag-hair'd crafty kern,"
7827,Henry VI Part 2,66,3.1.372,YORK,"Hath he conversed with the enemy,"
7828,Henry VI Part 2,66,3.1.373,YORK,And undiscover'd come to me again
7829,Henry VI Part 2,66,3.1.374,YORK,And given me notice of their villanies.
7830,Henry VI Part 2,66,3.1.375,YORK,"This devil here shall be my substitute,"
7831,Henry VI Part 2,66,3.1.376,YORK,"For that John Mortimer, which now is dead,"
7832,Henry VI Part 2,66,3.1.377,YORK,"In face, in gait, in speech, he doth resemble:"
7833,Henry VI Part 2,66,3.1.378,YORK,"By this I shall perceive the commons' mind,"
7834,Henry VI Part 2,66,3.1.379,YORK,How they affect the house and claim of York.
7835,Henry VI Part 2,66,3.1.380,YORK,"Say he be taken, rack'd and tortured,"
7836,Henry VI Part 2,66,3.1.381,YORK,I know no pain they can inflict upon him
7837,Henry VI Part 2,66,3.1.382,YORK,Will make him say I moved him to those arms.
7838,Henry VI Part 2,66,3.1.383,YORK,"Say that he thrive, as 'tis great like he will,"
7839,Henry VI Part 2,66,3.1.384,YORK,"Why, then from Ireland come I with my strength"
7840,Henry VI Part 2,66,3.1.385,YORK,"And reap the harvest which that rascal sow'd,"
7841,Henry VI Part 2,66,3.1.386,YORK,"For Humphrey being dead, as he shall be,"
7842,Henry VI Part 2,66,3.1.387,YORK,"And Henry put apart, the next for me."

7848,Henry VI Part 2,2,3.2.3,Second Murderer,O that it were to do! What have we done?
7849,Henry VI Part 2,2,3.2.4,Second Murderer,Didst ever hear a man so penitent?
7850,Henry VI Part 2,2,,Second Murderer,Enter SUFFOLK
7851,Henry VI Part 2,3,3.2.5,First Murder,Here comes my lord.

7853,Henry VI Part 2,5,3.2.7,First Murderer,"Ay, my good lord, he's dead."
7854,Henry VI Part 2,6,3.2.8,SUFFOLK,"Why, that's well said. Go, get you to my house,"
7855,Henry VI Part 2,6,3.2.9,SUFFOLK,I will reward you for this venturous deed.
7856,Henry VI Part 2,6,3.2.10,SUFFOLK,The king and all the peers are here at hand.
7857,Henry VI Part 2,6,3.2.11,SUFFOLK,"Have you laid fair the bed? Is all things well,"
7858,Henry VI Part 2,6,3.2.12,SUFFOLK,According as I gave directions?
7859,Henry VI Part 2,7,3.2.13,First Murderer,"'Tis, my good lord."

7864,Henry VI Part 2,9,3.2.16,KING HENRY VI,Say we intend to try his grace to-day.
7865,Henry VI Part 2,9,3.2.17,KING HENRY VI,"If he be guilty, as 'tis published."

7871,Henry VI Part 2,11,3.2.22,KING HENRY VI,He be approved in practise culpable.
7872,Henry VI Part 2,12,3.2.23,QUEEN MARGARET,"God forbid any malice should prevail,"
7873,Henry VI Part 2,12,3.2.24,QUEEN MARGARET,That faultless may condemn a nobleman!
7874,Henry VI Part 2,12,3.2.25,QUEEN MARGARET,Pray God he may acquit him of suspicion!
7875,Henry VI Part 2,13,3.2.26,KING HENRY VI,"I thank thee, Meg, these words content me much."
7876,Henry VI Part 2,13,,KING HENRY VI,Re-enter SUFFOLK
7877,Henry VI Part 2,13,3.2.27,KING HENRY VI,How now! why look'st thou pale? why tremblest thou?

7879,Henry VI Part 2,14,3.2.29,SUFFOLK,"Dead in his bed, my lord, Gloucester is dead."
7880,Henry VI Part 2,15,3.2.30,QUEEN MARGARET,"Marry, God forfend!"
7881,Henry VI Part 2,16,3.2.31,CARDINAL,God's secret judgment: I did dream to-night
7882,Henry VI Part 2,16,3.2.32,CARDINAL,The duke was dumb and could not speak a word.
7883,Henry VI Part 2,16,,CARDINAL,KING HENRY VI swoons
7884,Henry VI Part 2,17,3.2.33,QUEEN MARGARET,"How fares my lord? Help, lords! the king is dead."
7885,Henry VI Part 2,18,3.2.34,SOMERSET,"Rear up his body, wring him by the nose."
7886,Henry VI Part 2,19,3.2.35,QUEEN MARGARET,"Run, go, help, help! O Henry, ope thine eyes!"
7887,Henry VI Part 2,20,3.2.36,SUFFOLK,"He doth revive again: madam, be patient."
7888,Henry VI Part 2,21,3.2.37,KING HENRY VI,O heavenly God!
7889,Henry VI Part 2,22,3.2.38,QUEEN MARGARET,How fares my gracious lord?
7890,Henry VI Part 2,23,3.2.39,SUFFOLK,"Comfort, my sovereign! gracious Henry, comfort!"
7891,Henry VI Part 2,24,3.2.40,KING HENRY VI,"What, doth my Lord of Suffolk comfort me?"
7892,Henry VI Part 2,24,3.2.41,KING HENRY VI,"Came he right now to sing a raven's note,"
7893,Henry VI Part 2,24,3.2.42,KING HENRY VI,"Whose dismal tune bereft my vital powers,"
7894,Henry VI Part 2,24,3.2.43,KING HENRY VI,"And thinks he that the chirping of a wren,"
7895,Henry VI Part 2,24,3.2.44,KING HENRY VI,"By crying comfort from a hollow breast,"
7896,Henry VI Part 2,24,3.2.45,KING HENRY VI,Can chase away the first-conceived sound?
7897,Henry VI Part 2,24,3.2.46,KING HENRY VI,"Hide not thy poison with such sugar'd words,"
7898,Henry VI Part 2,24,3.2.47,KING HENRY VI,"Lay not thy hands on me, forbear, I say,"
7899,Henry VI Part 2,24,3.2.48,KING HENRY VI,Their touch affrights me as a serpent's sting.
7900,Henry VI Part 2,24,3.2.49,KING HENRY VI,"Thou baleful messenger, out of my sight!"
7901,Henry VI Part 2,24,3.2.50,KING HENRY VI,Upon thy eye-balls murderous tyranny
7902,Henry VI Part 2,24,3.2.51,KING HENRY VI,"Sits in grim majesty, to fright the world."
7903,Henry VI Part 2,24,3.2.52,KING HENRY VI,"Look not upon me, for thine eyes are wounding:"
7904,Henry VI Part 2,24,3.2.53,KING HENRY VI,"Yet do not go away: come, basilisk,"
7905,Henry VI Part 2,24,3.2.54,KING HENRY VI,"And kill the innocent gazer with thy sight,"
7906,Henry VI Part 2,24,3.2.55,KING HENRY VI,"For in the shade of death I shall find joy,"
7907,Henry VI Part 2,24,3.2.56,KING HENRY VI,"In life but double death, now Gloucester's dead."
7908,Henry VI Part 2,25,3.2.57,QUEEN MARGARET,Why do you rate my Lord of Suffolk thus?
7909,Henry VI Part 2,25,3.2.58,QUEEN MARGARET,"Although the duke was enemy to him,"
7910,Henry VI Part 2,25,3.2.59,QUEEN MARGARET,Yet he most Christian-like laments his death:
7911,Henry VI Part 2,25,3.2.60,QUEEN MARGARET,"And for myself, foe as he was to me,"
7912,Henry VI Part 2,25,3.2.61,QUEEN MARGARET,Might liquid tears or heart-offending groans
7913,Henry VI Part 2,25,3.2.62,QUEEN MARGARET,"Or blood-consuming sighs recall his life,"
7914,Henry VI Part 2,25,3.2.63,QUEEN MARGARET,"I would be blind with weeping, sick with groans,"
7915,Henry VI Part 2,25,3.2.64,QUEEN MARGARET,"Look pale as primrose with blood-drinking sighs,"
7916,Henry VI Part 2,25,3.2.65,QUEEN MARGARET,And all to have the noble duke alive.
7917,Henry VI Part 2,25,3.2.66,QUEEN MARGARET,What know I how the world may deem of me?
7918,Henry VI Part 2,25,3.2.67,QUEEN MARGARET,For it is known we were but hollow friends:
7919,Henry VI Part 2,25,3.2.68,QUEEN MARGARET,"It may be judged I made the duke away,"
7920,Henry VI Part 2,25,3.2.69,QUEEN MARGARET,"So shall my name with slander's tongue be wounded,"
7921,Henry VI Part 2,25,3.2.70,QUEEN MARGARET,And princes' courts be fill'd with my reproach.
7922,Henry VI Part 2,25,3.2.71,QUEEN MARGARET,"This get I by his death: ay me, unhappy!"
7923,Henry VI Part 2,25,3.2.72,QUEEN MARGARET,"To be a queen, and crown'd with infamy!"
7924,Henry VI Part 2,26,3.2.73,KING HENRY VI,"Ah, woe is me for Gloucester, wretched man!"
7925,Henry VI Part 2,27,3.2.74,QUEEN MARGARET,"Be woe for me, more wretched than he is."
7926,Henry VI Part 2,27,3.2.75,QUEEN MARGARET,"What, dost thou turn away and hide thy face?"
7927,Henry VI Part 2,27,3.2.76,QUEEN MARGARET,"I am no loathsome leper, look on me."
7928,Henry VI Part 2,27,3.2.77,QUEEN MARGARET,"What! art thou, like the adder, waxen deaf?"
7929,Henry VI Part 2,27,3.2.78,QUEEN MARGARET,Be poisonous too and kill thy forlorn queen.
7930,Henry VI Part 2,27,3.2.79,QUEEN MARGARET,Is all thy comfort shut in Gloucester's tomb?
7931,Henry VI Part 2,27,3.2.80,QUEEN MARGARET,"Why, then, dame Margaret was ne'er thy joy."
7932,Henry VI Part 2,27,3.2.81,QUEEN MARGARET,"Erect his statue and worship it,"
7933,Henry VI Part 2,27,3.2.82,QUEEN MARGARET,And make my image but an alehouse sign.
7934,Henry VI Part 2,27,3.2.83,QUEEN MARGARET,Was I for this nigh wreck'd upon the sea
7935,Henry VI Part 2,27,3.2.84,QUEEN MARGARET,And twice by awkward wind from England's bank
7936,Henry VI Part 2,27,3.2.85,QUEEN MARGARET,Drove back again unto my native clime?
7937,Henry VI Part 2,27,3.2.86,QUEEN MARGARET,"What boded this, but well forewarning wind"
7938,Henry VI Part 2,27,3.2.87,QUEEN MARGARET,"Did seem to say 'Seek not a scorpion's nest,"
7939,Henry VI Part 2,27,3.2.88,QUEEN MARGARET,Nor set no footing on this unkind shore'?
7940,Henry VI Part 2,27,3.2.89,QUEEN MARGARET,"What did I then, but cursed the gentle gusts"
7941,Henry VI Part 2,27,3.2.90,QUEEN MARGARET,And he that loosed them forth their brazen caves:
7942,Henry VI Part 2,27,3.2.91,QUEEN MARGARET,"And bid them blow towards England's blessed shore,"
7943,Henry VI Part 2,27,3.2.92,QUEEN MARGARET,Or turn our stern upon a dreadful rock
7944,Henry VI Part 2,27,3.2.93,QUEEN MARGARET,"Yet AEolus would not be a murderer,"
7945,Henry VI Part 2,27,3.2.94,QUEEN MARGARET,But left that hateful office unto thee:
7946,Henry VI Part 2,27,3.2.95,QUEEN MARGARET,"The pretty-vaulting sea refused to drown me,"
7947,Henry VI Part 2,27,3.2.96,QUEEN MARGARET,"Knowing that thou wouldst have me drown'd on shore,"
7948,Henry VI Part 2,27,3.2.97,QUEEN MARGARET,"With tears as salt as sea, through thy unkindness:"
7949,Henry VI Part 2,27,3.2.98,QUEEN MARGARET,The splitting rocks cower'd in the sinking sands
7950,Henry VI Part 2,27,3.2.99,QUEEN MARGARET,"And would not dash me with their ragged sides,"
7951,Henry VI Part 2,27,3.2.100,QUEEN MARGARET,"Because thy flinty heart, more hard than they,"
7952,Henry VI Part 2,27,3.2.101,QUEEN MARGARET,Might in thy palace perish Margaret.
7953,Henry VI Part 2,27,3.2.102,QUEEN MARGARET,"As far as I could ken thy chalky cliffs,"
7954,Henry VI Part 2,27,3.2.103,QUEEN MARGARET,"When from thy shore the tempest beat us back,"
7955,Henry VI Part 2,27,3.2.104,QUEEN MARGARET,"I stood upon the hatches in the storm,"
7956,Henry VI Part 2,27,3.2.105,QUEEN MARGARET,And when the dusky sky began to rob
7957,Henry VI Part 2,27,3.2.106,QUEEN MARGARET,"My earnest-gaping sight of thy land's view,"
7958,Henry VI Part 2,27,3.2.107,QUEEN MARGARET,"I took a costly jewel from my neck,"
7959,Henry VI Part 2,27,3.2.108,QUEEN MARGARET,"A heart it was, bound in with diamonds,"
7960,Henry VI Part 2,27,3.2.109,QUEEN MARGARET,"And threw it towards thy land: the sea received it,"
7961,Henry VI Part 2,27,3.2.110,QUEEN MARGARET,And so I wish'd thy body might my heart:
7962,Henry VI Part 2,27,3.2.111,QUEEN MARGARET,And even with this I lost fair England's view
7963,Henry VI Part 2,27,3.2.112,QUEEN MARGARET,And bid mine eyes be packing with my heart
7964,Henry VI Part 2,27,3.2.113,QUEEN MARGARET,"And call'd them blind and dusky spectacles,"
7965,Henry VI Part 2,27,3.2.114,QUEEN MARGARET,For losing ken of Albion's wished coast.
7966,Henry VI Part 2,27,3.2.115,QUEEN MARGARET,"How often have I tempted Suffolk's tongue,"
7967,Henry VI Part 2,27,3.2.116,QUEEN MARGARET,"The agent of thy foul inconstancy,"
7968,Henry VI Part 2,27,3.2.117,QUEEN MARGARET,"To sit and witch me, as Ascanius did"
7969,Henry VI Part 2,27,3.2.118,QUEEN MARGARET,When he to madding Dido would unfold
7970,Henry VI Part 2,27,3.2.119,QUEEN MARGARET,His father's acts commenced in burning Troy!
7971,Henry VI Part 2,27,3.2.120,QUEEN MARGARET,Am I not witch'd like her? or thou not false like him?
7972,Henry VI Part 2,27,3.2.121,QUEEN MARGARET,"Ay me, I can no more! die, Margaret!"
7973,Henry VI Part 2,27,3.2.122,QUEEN MARGARET,For Henry weeps that thou dost live so long.
7974,Henry VI Part 2,27,,QUEEN MARGARET,"Noise within. Enter WARWICK, SALISBURY, and many Commons"
7975,Henry VI Part 2,28,3.2.123,WARWICK,"It is reported, mighty sovereign,"
7976,Henry VI Part 2,28,3.2.124,WARWICK,That good Duke Humphrey traitorously is murder'd
7977,Henry VI Part 2,28,3.2.125,WARWICK,By Suffolk and the Cardinal Beaufort's means.
7978,Henry VI Part 2,28,3.2.126,WARWICK,"The commons, like an angry hive of bees"
7979,Henry VI Part 2,28,3.2.127,WARWICK,"That want their leader, scatter up and down"
7980,Henry VI Part 2,28,3.2.128,WARWICK,And care not who they sting in his revenge.
7981,Henry VI Part 2,28,3.2.129,WARWICK,"Myself have calm'd their spleenful mutiny,"
7982,Henry VI Part 2,28,3.2.130,WARWICK,Until they hear the order of his death.
7983,Henry VI Part 2,29,3.2.131,KING HENRY VI,"That he is dead, good Warwick, 'tis too true,"
7984,Henry VI Part 2,29,3.2.132,KING HENRY VI,"But how he died God knows, not Henry:"
7985,Henry VI Part 2,29,3.2.133,KING HENRY VI,"Enter his chamber, view his breathless corpse,"
7986,Henry VI Part 2,29,3.2.134,KING HENRY VI,And comment then upon his sudden death.
7987,Henry VI Part 2,30,3.2.135,WARWICK,"That shall I do, my liege. Stay, Salisbury,"
7988,Henry VI Part 2,30,3.2.136,WARWICK,With the rude multitude till I return.
7989,Henry VI Part 2,30,,WARWICK,Exit
7990,Henry VI Part 2,31,3.2.137,KING HENRY VI,"O Thou that judgest all things, stay my thoughts,"
7991,Henry VI Part 2,31,3.2.138,KING HENRY VI,"My thoughts, that labour to persuade my soul"
7992,Henry VI Part 2,31,3.2.139,KING HENRY VI,Some violent hands were laid on Humphrey's life!
7993,Henry VI Part 2,31,3.2.140,KING HENRY VI,"If my suspect be false, forgive me, God,"
7994,Henry VI Part 2,31,3.2.141,KING HENRY VI,For judgment only doth belong to thee.
7995,Henry VI Part 2,31,3.2.142,KING HENRY VI,Fain would I go to chafe his paly lips
7996,Henry VI Part 2,31,3.2.143,KING HENRY VI,"With twenty thousand kisses, and to drain"
7997,Henry VI Part 2,31,3.2.144,KING HENRY VI,"Upon his face an ocean of salt tears,"
7998,Henry VI Part 2,31,3.2.145,KING HENRY VI,"To tell my love unto his dumb deaf trunk,"
7999,Henry VI Part 2,31,3.2.146,KING HENRY VI,And with my fingers feel his hand unfeeling:
8000,Henry VI Part 2,31,3.2.147,KING HENRY VI,"But all in vain are these mean obsequies,"
8001,Henry VI Part 2,31,3.2.148,KING HENRY VI,"And to survey his dead and earthly image,"
8002,Henry VI Part 2,31,3.2.149,KING HENRY VI,What were it but to make my sorrow greater?
8003,Henry VI Part 2,31,,KING HENRY VI,"Re-enter WARWICK and others, bearing GLOUCESTER'S body on a bed"
8004,Henry VI Part 2,32,3.2.150,WARWICK,"Come hither, gracious sovereign, view this body."
8005,Henry VI Part 2,33,3.2.151,KING HENRY VI,"That is to see how deep my grave is made,"
8006,Henry VI Part 2,33,3.2.152,KING HENRY VI,"For with his soul fled all my worldly solace,"
8007,Henry VI Part 2,33,3.2.153,KING HENRY VI,For seeing him I see my life in death.
8008,Henry VI Part 2,34,3.2.154,WARWICK,As surely as my soul intends to live
8009,Henry VI Part 2,34,3.2.155,WARWICK,With that dread King that took our state upon him
8010,Henry VI Part 2,34,3.2.156,WARWICK,"To free us from his father's wrathful curse,"
8011,Henry VI Part 2,34,3.2.157,WARWICK,I do believe that violent hands were laid
8012,Henry VI Part 2,34,3.2.158,WARWICK,Upon the life of this thrice-famed duke.
8013,Henry VI Part 2,35,3.2.159,SUFFOLK,"A dreadful oath, sworn with a solemn tongue!"
8014,Henry VI Part 2,35,3.2.160,SUFFOLK,What instance gives Lord Warwick for his vow?
8015,Henry VI Part 2,36,3.2.161,WARWICK,See how the blood is settled in his face.
8016,Henry VI Part 2,36,3.2.162,WARWICK,"Oft have I seen a timely-parted ghost,"
8017,Henry VI Part 2,36,3.2.163,WARWICK,"Of ashy semblance, meagre, pale and bloodless,"
8018,Henry VI Part 2,36,3.2.164,WARWICK,"Being all descended to the labouring heart,"
8019,Henry VI Part 2,36,3.2.165,WARWICK,"Who, in the conflict that it holds with death,"
8020,Henry VI Part 2,36,3.2.166,WARWICK,"Attracts the same for aidance 'gainst the enemy,"
8021,Henry VI Part 2,36,3.2.167,WARWICK,Which with the heart there cools and ne'er returneth
8022,Henry VI Part 2,36,3.2.168,WARWICK,To blush and beautify the cheek again.
8023,Henry VI Part 2,36,3.2.169,WARWICK,"But see, his face is black and full of blood,"
8024,Henry VI Part 2,36,3.2.170,WARWICK,"His eye-balls further out than when he lived,"
8025,Henry VI Part 2,36,3.2.171,WARWICK,"Staring full ghastly like a strangled man,"
8026,Henry VI Part 2,36,3.2.172,WARWICK,"His hair uprear'd, his nostrils stretched with struggling,"
8027,Henry VI Part 2,36,3.2.173,WARWICK,"His hands abroad display'd, as one that grasp'd"
8028,Henry VI Part 2,36,3.2.174,WARWICK,And tugg'd for life and was by strength subdued:
8029,Henry VI Part 2,36,3.2.175,WARWICK,"Look, on the sheets his hair you see, is sticking,"
8030,Henry VI Part 2,36,3.2.176,WARWICK,"His well-proportion'd beard made rough and rugged,"
8031,Henry VI Part 2,36,3.2.177,WARWICK,Like to the summer's corn by tempest lodged.
8032,Henry VI Part 2,36,3.2.178,WARWICK,"It cannot be but he was murder'd here,"
8033,Henry VI Part 2,36,3.2.179,WARWICK,The least of all these signs were probable.
8034,Henry VI Part 2,37,3.2.180,SUFFOLK,"Why, Warwick, who should do the duke to death?"
8035,Henry VI Part 2,37,3.2.181,SUFFOLK,"Myself and Beaufort had him in protection,"
8036,Henry VI Part 2,37,3.2.182,SUFFOLK,"And we, I hope, sir, are no murderers."
8037,Henry VI Part 2,38,3.2.183,WARWICK,"But both of you were vow'd Duke Humphrey's foes,"
8038,Henry VI Part 2,38,3.2.184,WARWICK,"And you, forsooth, had the good duke to keep:"
8039,Henry VI Part 2,38,3.2.185,WARWICK,"'Tis like you would not feast him like a friend,"
8040,Henry VI Part 2,38,3.2.186,WARWICK,And 'tis well seen he found an enemy.
8041,Henry VI Part 2,39,3.2.187,QUEEN MARGARET,"Then you, belike, suspect these noblemen"
8042,Henry VI Part 2,39,3.2.188,QUEEN MARGARET,As guilty of Duke Humphrey's timeless death.
8043,Henry VI Part 2,40,3.2.189,WARWICK,Who finds the heifer dead and bleeding fresh
8044,Henry VI Part 2,40,3.2.190,WARWICK,"And sees fast by a butcher with an axe,"
8045,Henry VI Part 2,40,3.2.191,WARWICK,But will suspect 'twas he that made the slaughter?
8046,Henry VI Part 2,40,3.2.192,WARWICK,"Who finds the partridge in the puttock's nest,"
8047,Henry VI Part 2,40,3.2.193,WARWICK,"But may imagine how the bird was dead,"
8048,Henry VI Part 2,40,3.2.194,WARWICK,Although the kite soar with unbloodied beak?
8049,Henry VI Part 2,40,3.2.195,WARWICK,Even so suspicious is this tragedy.
8050,Henry VI Part 2,41,3.2.196,QUEEN MARGARET,"Are you the butcher, Suffolk? Where's your knife?"
8051,Henry VI Part 2,41,3.2.197,QUEEN MARGARET,Is Beaufort term'd a kite? Where are his talons?
8052,Henry VI Part 2,42,3.2.198,SUFFOLK,"I wear no knife to slaughter sleeping men,"
8053,Henry VI Part 2,42,3.2.199,SUFFOLK,"But here's a vengeful sword, rusted with ease,"
8054,Henry VI Part 2,42,3.2.200,SUFFOLK,That shall be scoured in his rancorous heart
8055,Henry VI Part 2,42,3.2.201,SUFFOLK,That slanders me with murder's crimson badge.
8056,Henry VI Part 2,42,3.2.202,SUFFOLK,"Say, if thou darest, proud Lord of Warwick-shire,"
8057,Henry VI Part 2,42,3.2.203,SUFFOLK,That I am faulty in Duke Humphrey's death.
8058,Henry VI Part 2,42,,SUFFOLK,"Exeunt CARDINAL, SOMERSET, and others"
8059,Henry VI Part 2,43,3.2.204,WARWICK,"What dares not Warwick, if false Suffolk dare him?"
8060,Henry VI Part 2,44,3.2.205,QUEEN MARGARET,He dares not calm his contumelious spirit
8061,Henry VI Part 2,44,3.2.206,QUEEN MARGARET,"Nor cease to be an arrogant controller,"
8062,Henry VI Part 2,44,3.2.207,QUEEN MARGARET,Though Suffolk dare him twenty thousand times.
8063,Henry VI Part 2,45,3.2.208,WARWICK,"Madam, be still, with reverence may I say,"
8064,Henry VI Part 2,45,3.2.209,WARWICK,For every word you speak in his behalf
8065,Henry VI Part 2,45,3.2.210,WARWICK,Is slander to your royal dignity.
8066,Henry VI Part 2,46,3.2.211,SUFFOLK,"Blunt-witted lord, ignoble in demeanor!"
8067,Henry VI Part 2,46,3.2.212,SUFFOLK,"If ever lady wrong'd her lord so much,"
8068,Henry VI Part 2,46,3.2.213,SUFFOLK,Thy mother took into her blameful bed
8069,Henry VI Part 2,46,3.2.214,SUFFOLK,"Some stern untutor'd churl, and noble stock"
8070,Henry VI Part 2,46,3.2.215,SUFFOLK,"Was graft with crab-tree slip, whose fruit thou art,"
8071,Henry VI Part 2,46,3.2.216,SUFFOLK,And never of the Nevils' noble race.
8072,Henry VI Part 2,47,3.2.217,WARWICK,But that the guilt of murder bucklers thee
8073,Henry VI Part 2,47,3.2.218,WARWICK,"And I should rob the deathsman of his fee,"
8074,Henry VI Part 2,47,3.2.219,WARWICK,"Quitting thee thereby of ten thousand shames,"
8075,Henry VI Part 2,47,3.2.220,WARWICK,"And that my sovereign's presence makes me mild,"
8076,Henry VI Part 2,47,3.2.221,WARWICK,"I would, false murderous coward, on thy knee"
8077,Henry VI Part 2,47,3.2.222,WARWICK,"Make thee beg pardon for thy passed speech,"
8078,Henry VI Part 2,47,3.2.223,WARWICK,And say it was thy mother that thou meant'st
8079,Henry VI Part 2,47,3.2.224,WARWICK,"That thou thyself was born in bastardy,"
8080,Henry VI Part 2,47,3.2.225,WARWICK,"And after all this fearful homage done,"
8081,Henry VI Part 2,47,3.2.226,WARWICK,"Give thee thy hire and send thy soul to hell,"
8082,Henry VI Part 2,47,3.2.227,WARWICK,Pernicious blood-sucker of sleeping men!
8083,Henry VI Part 2,48,3.2.228,SUFFOLK,"Thou shall be waking well I shed thy blood,"
8084,Henry VI Part 2,48,3.2.229,SUFFOLK,If from this presence thou darest go with me.
8085,Henry VI Part 2,49,3.2.230,WARWICK,"Away even now, or I will drag thee hence:"
8086,Henry VI Part 2,49,3.2.231,WARWICK,"Unworthy though thou art, I'll cope with thee"
8087,Henry VI Part 2,49,3.2.232,WARWICK,And do some service to Duke Humphrey's ghost.
8088,Henry VI Part 2,49,,WARWICK,Exeunt SUFFOLK and WARWICK
8089,Henry VI Part 2,50,3.2.233,KING HENRY VI,What stronger breastplate than a heart untainted!
8090,Henry VI Part 2,50,3.2.234,KING HENRY VI,"Thrice is he armed that hath his quarrel just,"
8091,Henry VI Part 2,50,3.2.235,KING HENRY VI,"And he but naked, though lock'd up in steel"
8092,Henry VI Part 2,50,3.2.236,KING HENRY VI,Whose conscience with injustice is corrupted.
8093,Henry VI Part 2,50,,KING HENRY VI,A noise within
8094,Henry VI Part 2,51,3.2.237,QUEEN MARGARET,What noise is this?
8095,Henry VI Part 2,51,,QUEEN MARGARET,"Re-enter SUFFOLK and WARWICK, with their weapons drawn"
8096,Henry VI Part 2,52,3.2.238,KING HENRY VI,"Why, how now, lords! your wrathful weapons drawn"
8097,Henry VI Part 2,52,3.2.239,KING HENRY VI,Here in our presence! dare you be so bold?
8098,Henry VI Part 2,52,3.2.240,KING HENRY VI,"Why, what tumultuous clamour have we here?"
8099,Henry VI Part 2,53,3.2.241,SUFFOLK,The traitorous Warwick with the men of Bury
8100,Henry VI Part 2,53,3.2.242,SUFFOLK,"Set all upon me, mighty sovereign."
8101,Henry VI Part 2,54,3.2.243,SALISBURY,"[To the Commons, entering]  Sirs, stand apart,"
8102,Henry VI Part 2,54,3.2.244,SALISBURY,the king shall know your mind.
8103,Henry VI Part 2,54,3.2.245,SALISBURY,"Dread lord, the commons send you word by me,"
8104,Henry VI Part 2,54,3.2.246,SALISBURY,"Unless Lord Suffolk straight be done to death,"
8105,Henry VI Part 2,54,3.2.247,SALISBURY,"Or banished fair England's territories,"
8106,Henry VI Part 2,54,3.2.248,SALISBURY,They will by violence tear him from your palace
8107,Henry VI Part 2,54,3.2.249,SALISBURY,And torture him with grievous lingering death.
8108,Henry VI Part 2,54,3.2.250,SALISBURY,"They say, by him the good Duke Humphrey died,"
8109,Henry VI Part 2,54,3.2.251,SALISBURY,"They say, in him they fear your highness' death,"
8110,Henry VI Part 2,54,3.2.252,SALISBURY,"And mere instinct of love and loyalty,"
8111,Henry VI Part 2,54,3.2.253,SALISBURY,"Free from a stubborn opposite intent,"
8112,Henry VI Part 2,54,3.2.254,SALISBURY,"As being thought to contradict your liking,"
8113,Henry VI Part 2,54,3.2.255,SALISBURY,Makes them thus forward in his banishment.
8114,Henry VI Part 2,54,3.2.256,SALISBURY,"They say, in care of your most royal person,"
8115,Henry VI Part 2,54,3.2.257,SALISBURY,That if your highness should intend to sleep
8116,Henry VI Part 2,54,3.2.258,SALISBURY,And charge that no man should disturb your rest
8117,Henry VI Part 2,54,3.2.259,SALISBURY,"In pain of your dislike or pain of death,"
8118,Henry VI Part 2,54,3.2.260,SALISBURY,"Yet, notwithstanding such a strait edict,"
8119,Henry VI Part 2,54,3.2.261,SALISBURY,"Were there a serpent seen, with forked tongue,"
8120,Henry VI Part 2,54,3.2.262,SALISBURY,"That slily glided towards your majesty,"
8121,Henry VI Part 2,54,3.2.263,SALISBURY,"It were but necessary you were waked,"
8122,Henry VI Part 2,54,3.2.264,SALISBURY,"Lest, being suffer'd in that harmful slumber,"
8123,Henry VI Part 2,54,3.2.265,SALISBURY,"The mortal worm might make the sleep eternal,"
8124,Henry VI Part 2,54,3.2.266,SALISBURY,"And therefore do they cry, though you forbid,"
8125,Henry VI Part 2,54,3.2.267,SALISBURY,"That they will guard you, whether you will or no,"
8126,Henry VI Part 2,54,3.2.268,SALISBURY,"From such fell serpents as false Suffolk is,"
8127,Henry VI Part 2,54,3.2.269,SALISBURY,"With whose envenomed and fatal sting,"
8128,Henry VI Part 2,54,3.2.270,SALISBURY,"Your loving uncle, twenty times his worth,"
8129,Henry VI Part 2,54,3.2.271,SALISBURY,"They say, is shamefully bereft of life."
8130,Henry VI Part 2,55,3.2.272,Commons,"[Within]  An answer from the king, my"
8131,Henry VI Part 2,55,3.2.273,Commons,Lord of Salisbury!
8132,Henry VI Part 2,56,3.2.274,SUFFOLK,"'Tis like the commons, rude unpolish'd hinds,"
8133,Henry VI Part 2,56,3.2.275,SUFFOLK,Could send such message to their sovereign:
8134,Henry VI Part 2,56,3.2.276,SUFFOLK,"But you, my lord, were glad to be employ'd,"
8135,Henry VI Part 2,56,3.2.277,SUFFOLK,To show how quaint an orator you are:
8136,Henry VI Part 2,56,3.2.278,SUFFOLK,But all the honour Salisbury hath won
8137,Henry VI Part 2,56,3.2.279,SUFFOLK,"Is, that he was the lord ambassador"
8138,Henry VI Part 2,56,3.2.280,SUFFOLK,Sent from a sort of tinkers to the king.
8139,Henry VI Part 2,57,3.2.281,Commons,"[Within]  An answer from the king, or we will all break in!"
8140,Henry VI Part 2,58,3.2.282,KING HENRY VI,"Go, Salisbury, and tell them all from me."
8141,Henry VI Part 2,58,3.2.283,KING HENRY VI,"I thank them for their tender loving care,"
8142,Henry VI Part 2,58,3.2.284,KING HENRY VI,"And had I not been cited so by them,"
8143,Henry VI Part 2,58,3.2.285,KING HENRY VI,"Yet did I purpose as they do entreat,"
8144,Henry VI Part 2,58,3.2.286,KING HENRY VI,"For, sure, my thoughts do hourly prophesy"
8145,Henry VI Part 2,58,3.2.287,KING HENRY VI,Mischance unto my state by Suffolk's means:
8146,Henry VI Part 2,58,3.2.288,KING HENRY VI,"And therefore, by His majesty I swear,"
8147,Henry VI Part 2,58,3.2.289,KING HENRY VI,"Whose far unworthy deputy I am,"
8148,Henry VI Part 2,58,3.2.290,KING HENRY VI,He shall not breathe infection in this air
8149,Henry VI Part 2,58,3.2.291,KING HENRY VI,"But three days longer, on the pain of death."
8150,Henry VI Part 2,58,,KING HENRY VI,Exit SALISBURY
8151,Henry VI Part 2,59,3.2.292,QUEEN MARGARET,"O Henry, let me plead for gentle Suffolk!"
8152,Henry VI Part 2,60,3.2.293,KING HENRY VI,"Ungentle queen, to call him gentle Suffolk!"
8153,Henry VI Part 2,60,3.2.294,KING HENRY VI,"No more, I say: if thou dost plead for him,"
8154,Henry VI Part 2,60,3.2.295,KING HENRY VI,Thou wilt but add increase unto my wrath.
8155,Henry VI Part 2,60,3.2.296,KING HENRY VI,"Had I but said, I would have kept my word,"
8156,Henry VI Part 2,60,3.2.297,KING HENRY VI,"But when I swear, it is irrevocable."
8157,Henry VI Part 2,60,3.2.298,KING HENRY VI,"If, after three days' space, thou here be'st found"
8158,Henry VI Part 2,60,3.2.299,KING HENRY VI,"On any ground that I am ruler of,"
8159,Henry VI Part 2,60,3.2.300,KING HENRY VI,The world shall not be ransom for thy life.
8160,Henry VI Part 2,60,3.2.301,KING HENRY VI,"Come, Warwick, come, good Warwick, go with me,"
8161,Henry VI Part 2,60,3.2.302,KING HENRY VI,I have great matters to impart to thee.
8162,Henry VI Part 2,60,,KING HENRY VI,Exeunt all but QUEEN MARGARET and SUFFOLK
8163,Henry VI Part 2,61,3.2.303,QUEEN MARGARET,Mischance and sorrow go along with you!
8164,Henry VI Part 2,61,3.2.304,QUEEN MARGARET,Heart's discontent and sour affliction
8165,Henry VI Part 2,61,3.2.305,QUEEN MARGARET,Be playfellows to keep you company!
8166,Henry VI Part 2,61,3.2.306,QUEEN MARGARET,"There's two of you, the devil make a third!"
8167,Henry VI Part 2,61,3.2.307,QUEEN MARGARET,And threefold vengeance tend upon your steps!
8168,Henry VI Part 2,62,3.2.308,SUFFOLK,"Cease, gentle queen, these execrations,"
8169,Henry VI Part 2,62,3.2.309,SUFFOLK,And let thy Suffolk take his heavy leave.
8170,Henry VI Part 2,63,3.2.310,QUEEN MARGARET,"Fie, coward woman and soft-hearted wretch!"
8171,Henry VI Part 2,63,3.2.311,QUEEN MARGARET,Hast thou not spirit to curse thine enemy?
8172,Henry VI Part 2,64,3.2.312,SUFFOLK,A plague upon them! wherefore should I curse them?
8173,Henry VI Part 2,64,3.2.313,SUFFOLK,"Would curses kill, as doth the mandrake's groan,"
8174,Henry VI Part 2,64,3.2.314,SUFFOLK,"I would invent as bitter-searching terms,"
8175,Henry VI Part 2,64,3.2.315,SUFFOLK,"As curst, as harsh and horrible to hear,"
8176,Henry VI Part 2,64,3.2.316,SUFFOLK,"Deliver'd strongly through my fixed teeth,"
8177,Henry VI Part 2,64,3.2.317,SUFFOLK,"With full as many signs of deadly hate,"
8178,Henry VI Part 2,64,3.2.318,SUFFOLK,As lean-faced Envy in her loathsome cave:
8179,Henry VI Part 2,64,3.2.319,SUFFOLK,"My tongue should stumble in mine earnest words,"
8180,Henry VI Part 2,64,3.2.320,SUFFOLK,"Mine eyes should sparkle like the beaten flint,"
8181,Henry VI Part 2,64,3.2.321,SUFFOLK,"Mine hair be fixed on end, as one distract,"
8182,Henry VI Part 2,64,3.2.322,SUFFOLK,"Ay, every joint should seem to curse and ban:"
8183,Henry VI Part 2,64,3.2.323,SUFFOLK,"And even now my burthen'd heart would break,"
8184,Henry VI Part 2,64,3.2.324,SUFFOLK,Should I not curse them. Poison be their drink!
8185,Henry VI Part 2,64,3.2.325,SUFFOLK,"Gall, worse than gall, the daintiest that they taste!"
8186,Henry VI Part 2,64,3.2.326,SUFFOLK,Their sweetest shade a grove of cypress trees!
8187,Henry VI Part 2,64,3.2.327,SUFFOLK,Their chiefest prospect murdering basilisks!
8188,Henry VI Part 2,64,3.2.328,SUFFOLK,Their softest touch as smart as lizards' sting!
8189,Henry VI Part 2,64,3.2.329,SUFFOLK,"Their music frightful as the serpent's hiss,"
8190,Henry VI Part 2,64,3.2.330,SUFFOLK,And boding screech-owls make the concert full!
8191,Henry VI Part 2,64,3.2.331,SUFFOLK,All the foul terrors in dark-seated hell--
8192,Henry VI Part 2,65,3.2.332,QUEEN MARGARET,"Enough, sweet Suffolk, thou torment'st thyself,"
8193,Henry VI Part 2,65,3.2.333,QUEEN MARGARET,"And these dread curses, like the sun 'gainst glass,"
8194,Henry VI Part 2,65,3.2.334,QUEEN MARGARET,"Or like an overcharged gun, recoil,"
8195,Henry VI Part 2,65,3.2.335,QUEEN MARGARET,And turn the force of them upon thyself.
8196,Henry VI Part 2,66,3.2.336,SUFFOLK,"You bade me ban, and will you bid me leave?"
8197,Henry VI Part 2,66,3.2.337,SUFFOLK,"Now, by the ground that I am banish'd from,"
8198,Henry VI Part 2,66,3.2.338,SUFFOLK,"Well could I curse away a winter's night,"
8199,Henry VI Part 2,66,3.2.339,SUFFOLK,"Though standing naked on a mountain top,"
8200,Henry VI Part 2,66,3.2.340,SUFFOLK,"Where biting cold would never let grass grow,"
8201,Henry VI Part 2,66,3.2.341,SUFFOLK,And think it but a minute spent in sport.
8202,Henry VI Part 2,67,3.2.342,QUEEN MARGARET,"O, let me entreat thee cease. Give me thy hand,"
8203,Henry VI Part 2,67,3.2.343,QUEEN MARGARET,"That I may dew it with my mournful tears,"
8204,Henry VI Part 2,67,3.2.344,QUEEN MARGARET,"Nor let the rain of heaven wet this place,"
8205,Henry VI Part 2,67,3.2.345,QUEEN MARGARET,To wash away my woful monuments.
8206,Henry VI Part 2,67,3.2.346,QUEEN MARGARET,"O, could this kiss be printed in thy hand,"
8207,Henry VI Part 2,67,3.2.347,QUEEN MARGARET,"That thou mightst think upon these by the seal,"
8208,Henry VI Part 2,67,3.2.348,QUEEN MARGARET,Through whom a thousand sighs are breathed for thee!
8209,Henry VI Part 2,67,3.2.349,QUEEN MARGARET,"So, get thee gone, that I may know my grief,"
8210,Henry VI Part 2,67,3.2.350,QUEEN MARGARET,"'Tis but surmised whiles thou art standing by,"
8211,Henry VI Part 2,67,3.2.351,QUEEN MARGARET,As one that surfeits thinking on a want.
8212,Henry VI Part 2,67,3.2.352,QUEEN MARGARET,"I will repeal thee, or, be well assured,"
8213,Henry VI Part 2,67,3.2.353,QUEEN MARGARET,Adventure to be banished myself:
8214,Henry VI Part 2,67,3.2.354,QUEEN MARGARET,"And banished I am, if but from thee."
8215,Henry VI Part 2,67,3.2.355,QUEEN MARGARET,"Go, speak not to me, even now be gone."
8216,Henry VI Part 2,67,3.2.356,QUEEN MARGARET,"O, go not yet! Even thus two friends condemn'd"
8217,Henry VI Part 2,67,3.2.357,QUEEN MARGARET,"Embrace and kiss and take ten thousand leaves,"
8218,Henry VI Part 2,67,3.2.358,QUEEN MARGARET,Loather a hundred times to part than die.
8219,Henry VI Part 2,67,3.2.359,QUEEN MARGARET,"Yet now farewell, and farewell life with thee!"
8220,Henry VI Part 2,68,3.2.360,SUFFOLK,"Thus is poor Suffolk ten times banished,"
8221,Henry VI Part 2,68,3.2.361,SUFFOLK,"Once by the king, and three times thrice by thee."
8222,Henry VI Part 2,68,3.2.362,SUFFOLK,"'Tis not the land I care for, wert thou thence,"
8223,Henry VI Part 2,68,3.2.363,SUFFOLK,"A wilderness is populous enough,"
8224,Henry VI Part 2,68,3.2.364,SUFFOLK,So Suffolk had thy heavenly company:
8225,Henry VI Part 2,68,3.2.365,SUFFOLK,"For where thou art, there is the world itself,"
8226,Henry VI Part 2,68,3.2.366,SUFFOLK,"With every several pleasure in the world,"
8227,Henry VI Part 2,68,3.2.367,SUFFOLK,"And where thou art not, desolation."
8228,Henry VI Part 2,68,3.2.368,SUFFOLK,"I can no more: live thou to joy thy life,"
8229,Henry VI Part 2,68,3.2.369,SUFFOLK,Myself no joy in nought but that thou livest.
8230,Henry VI Part 2,68,,SUFFOLK,Enter VAUX
8231,Henry VI Part 2,69,3.2.370,QUEEN MARGARET,"Wither goes Vaux so fast? what news, I prithee?"
8232,Henry VI Part 2,70,3.2.371,VAUX,To signify unto his majesty
8233,Henry VI Part 2,70,3.2.372,VAUX,"That Cardinal Beaufort is at point of death,"
8234,Henry VI Part 2,70,3.2.373,VAUX,"For suddenly a grievous sickness took him,"
8235,Henry VI Part 2,70,3.2.374,VAUX,"That makes him gasp and stare and catch the air,"
8236,Henry VI Part 2,70,3.2.375,VAUX,Blaspheming God and cursing men on earth.
8237,Henry VI Part 2,70,3.2.376,VAUX,Sometimes he talks as if Duke Humphrey's ghost
8238,Henry VI Part 2,70,3.2.377,VAUX,"Were by his side, sometime he calls the king,"
8239,Henry VI Part 2,70,3.2.378,VAUX,"And whispers to his pillow, as to him,"
8240,Henry VI Part 2,70,3.2.379,VAUX,"The secrets of his overcharged soul,"
8241,Henry VI Part 2,70,3.2.380,VAUX,And I am sent to tell his majesty
8242,Henry VI Part 2,70,3.2.381,VAUX,That even now he cries aloud for him.
8243,Henry VI Part 2,71,3.2.382,QUEEN MARGARET,Go tell this heavy message to the king.
8244,Henry VI Part 2,71,,QUEEN MARGARET,Exit VAUX
8245,Henry VI Part 2,71,3.2.383,QUEEN MARGARET,Ay me! what is this world! what news are these!
8246,Henry VI Part 2,71,3.2.384,QUEEN MARGARET,"But wherefore grieve I at an hour's poor loss,"
8247,Henry VI Part 2,71,3.2.385,QUEEN MARGARET,"Omitting Suffolk's exile, my soul's treasure?"
8248,Henry VI Part 2,71,3.2.386,QUEEN MARGARET,"Why only, Suffolk, mourn I not for thee,"
8249,Henry VI Part 2,71,3.2.387,QUEEN MARGARET,"And with the southern clouds contend in tears,"
8250,Henry VI Part 2,71,3.2.388,QUEEN MARGARET,"Theirs for the earth's increase, mine for my sorrows?"
8251,Henry VI Part 2,71,3.2.389,QUEEN MARGARET,"Now get thee hence: the king, thou know'st, is coming,"
8252,Henry VI Part 2,71,3.2.390,QUEEN MARGARET,"If thou be found by me, thou art but dead."
8253,Henry VI Part 2,72,3.2.391,SUFFOLK,"If I depart from thee, I cannot live,"
8254,Henry VI Part 2,72,3.2.392,SUFFOLK,"And in thy sight to die, what were it else"
8255,Henry VI Part 2,72,3.2.393,SUFFOLK,But like a pleasant slumber in thy lap?
8256,Henry VI Part 2,72,3.2.394,SUFFOLK,"Here could I breathe my soul into the air,"
8257,Henry VI Part 2,72,3.2.395,SUFFOLK,As mild and gentle as the cradle-babe
8258,Henry VI Part 2,72,3.2.396,SUFFOLK,Dying with mother's dug between its lips:
8259,Henry VI Part 2,72,3.2.397,SUFFOLK,"Where, from thy sight, I should be raging mad,"
8260,Henry VI Part 2,72,3.2.398,SUFFOLK,"And cry out for thee to close up mine eyes,"
8261,Henry VI Part 2,72,3.2.399,SUFFOLK,"To have thee with thy lips to stop my mouth,"
8262,Henry VI Part 2,72,3.2.400,SUFFOLK,"So shouldst thou either turn my flying soul,"
8263,Henry VI Part 2,72,3.2.401,SUFFOLK,"Or I should breathe it so into thy body,"
8264,Henry VI Part 2,72,3.2.402,SUFFOLK,And then it lived in sweet Elysium.
8265,Henry VI Part 2,72,3.2.403,SUFFOLK,"To die by thee were but to die in jest,"
8266,Henry VI Part 2,72,3.2.404,SUFFOLK,From thee to die were torture more than death:
8267,Henry VI Part 2,72,3.2.405,SUFFOLK,"O, let me stay, befall what may befall!"
8268,Henry VI Part 2,73,3.2.406,QUEEN MARGARET,"Away! though parting be a fretful corrosive,"
8269,Henry VI Part 2,73,3.2.407,QUEEN MARGARET,It is applied to a deathful wound.
8270,Henry VI Part 2,73,3.2.408,QUEEN MARGARET,"To France, sweet Suffolk: let me hear from thee,"
8271,Henry VI Part 2,73,3.2.409,QUEEN MARGARET,"For wheresoe'er thou art in this world's globe,"
8272,Henry VI Part 2,73,3.2.410,QUEEN MARGARET,I'll have an Iris that shall find thee out.
8273,Henry VI Part 2,74,3.2.411,SUFFOLK,I go.
8274,Henry VI Part 2,75,3.2.412,QUEEN MARGARET,And take my heart with thee.
8275,Henry VI Part 2,76,3.2.413,SUFFOLK,"A jewel, lock'd into the wofull'st cask"
8276,Henry VI Part 2,76,3.2.414,SUFFOLK,That ever did contain a thing of worth.
8277,Henry VI Part 2,76,3.2.415,SUFFOLK,"Even as a splitted bark, so sunder we"
8278,Henry VI Part 2,76,3.2.416,SUFFOLK,This way fall I to death.
8279,Henry VI Part 2,77,3.2.417,QUEEN MARGARET,This way for me.

8284,Henry VI Part 2,1,3.3.2,KING HENRY VI,thy sovereign.
8285,Henry VI Part 2,2,3.3.3,CARDINAL,"If thou be'st death, I'll give thee England's treasure,"
8286,Henry VI Part 2,2,3.3.4,CARDINAL,"Enough to purchase such another island,"
8287,Henry VI Part 2,2,3.3.5,CARDINAL,"So thou wilt let me live, and feel no pain."
8288,Henry VI Part 2,3,3.3.6,KING HENRY VI,"Ah, what a sign it is of evil life,"
8289,Henry VI Part 2,3,3.3.7,KING HENRY VI,Where death's approach is seen so terrible!
8290,Henry VI Part 2,4,3.3.8,WARWICK,"Beaufort, it is thy sovereign speaks to thee."
8291,Henry VI Part 2,5,3.3.9,CARDINAL,Bring me unto my trial when you will.
8292,Henry VI Part 2,5,3.3.10,CARDINAL,Died he not in his bed? where should he die?
8293,Henry VI Part 2,5,3.3.11,CARDINAL,"Can I make men live, whether they will or no?"
8294,Henry VI Part 2,5,3.3.12,CARDINAL,"O, torture me no more! I will confess."
8295,Henry VI Part 2,5,3.3.13,CARDINAL,Alive again? then show me where he is:
8296,Henry VI Part 2,5,3.3.14,CARDINAL,I'll give a thousand pound to look upon him.
8297,Henry VI Part 2,5,3.3.15,CARDINAL,"He hath no eyes, the dust hath blinded them."
8298,Henry VI Part 2,5,3.3.16,CARDINAL,"Comb down his hair, look, look! it stands upright,"
8299,Henry VI Part 2,5,3.3.17,CARDINAL,Like lime-twigs set to catch my winged soul.
8300,Henry VI Part 2,5,3.3.18,CARDINAL,"Give me some drink, and bid the apothecary"
8301,Henry VI Part 2,5,3.3.19,CARDINAL,Bring the strong poison that I bought of him.
8302,Henry VI Part 2,6,3.3.20,KING HENRY VI,O thou eternal Mover of the heavens.
8303,Henry VI Part 2,6,3.3.21,KING HENRY VI,Look with a gentle eye upon this wretch!
8304,Henry VI Part 2,6,3.3.22,KING HENRY VI,"O, beat away the busy meddling fiend"
8305,Henry VI Part 2,6,3.3.23,KING HENRY VI,That lays strong siege unto this wretch's soul.
8306,Henry VI Part 2,6,3.3.24,KING HENRY VI,And from his bosom purge this black despair!
8307,Henry VI Part 2,7,3.3.25,WARWICK,"See, how the pangs of death do make him grin!"
8308,Henry VI Part 2,8,3.3.26,SALISBURY,"Disturb him not, let him pass peaceably."
8309,Henry VI Part 2,9,3.3.27,KING HENRY VI,"Peace to his soul, if God's good pleasure be!"
8310,Henry VI Part 2,9,3.3.28,KING HENRY VI,"Lord cardinal, if thou think'st on heaven's bliss,"
8311,Henry VI Part 2,9,3.3.29,KING HENRY VI,"Hold up thy hand, make signal of thy hope."
8312,Henry VI Part 2,9,3.3.30,KING HENRY VI,"He dies, and makes no sign. O God, forgive him!"
8313,Henry VI Part 2,10,3.3.31,WARWICK,So bad a death argues a monstrous life.
8314,Henry VI Part 2,11,3.3.32,KING HENRY VI,"Forbear to judge, for we are sinners all."
8315,Henry VI Part 2,11,3.3.33,KING HENRY VI,"Close up his eyes and draw the curtain close,"
8316,Henry VI Part 2,11,3.3.34,KING HENRY VI,And let us all to meditation.

8321,Henry VI Part 2,1,4.1.1,Captain,"The gaudy, blabbing and remorseful day"
8322,Henry VI Part 2,1,4.1.2,Captain,"Is crept into the bosom of the sea,"
8323,Henry VI Part 2,1,4.1.3,Captain,And now loud-howling wolves arouse the jades
8324,Henry VI Part 2,1,4.1.4,Captain,"That drag the tragic melancholy night,"
8325,Henry VI Part 2,1,4.1.5,Captain,"Who, with their drowsy, slow and flagging wings,"
8326,Henry VI Part 2,1,4.1.6,Captain,Clip dead men's graves and from their misty jaws
8327,Henry VI Part 2,1,4.1.7,Captain,Breathe foul contagious darkness in the air.
8328,Henry VI Part 2,1,4.1.8,Captain,"Therefore bring forth the soldiers of our prize,"
8329,Henry VI Part 2,1,4.1.9,Captain,"For, whilst our pinnace anchors in the Downs,"
8330,Henry VI Part 2,1,4.1.10,Captain,"Here shall they make their ransom on the sand,"
8331,Henry VI Part 2,1,4.1.11,Captain,Or with their blood stain this discolour'd shore.
8332,Henry VI Part 2,1,4.1.12,Captain,"Master, this prisoner freely give I thee,"
8333,Henry VI Part 2,1,4.1.13,Captain,"And thou that art his mate, make boot of this,"

8336,Henry VI Part 2,3,4.1.16,Master,"A thousand crowns, or else lay down your head."
8337,Henry VI Part 2,3,4.1.17,Master,"Master's-Mate	And so much shall you give, or off goes yours."
8338,Henry VI Part 2,4,4.1.18,Captain,"What, think you much to pay two thousand crowns,"
8339,Henry VI Part 2,4,4.1.19,Captain,And bear the name and port of gentlemen?
8340,Henry VI Part 2,4,4.1.20,Captain,"Cut both the villains' throats, for die you shall:"
8341,Henry VI Part 2,4,4.1.21,Captain,The lives of those which we have lost in fight
8342,Henry VI Part 2,4,4.1.22,Captain,Be counterpoised with such a petty sum!
8343,Henry VI Part 2,5,4.1.23,First Gentleman,"I'll give it, sir, and therefore spare my life."
8344,Henry VI Part 2,6,4.1.24,Second Gentleman,And so will I and write home for it straight.
8345,Henry VI Part 2,7,4.1.25,WHITMORE,"I lost mine eye in laying the prize aboard,"
8346,Henry VI Part 2,7,4.1.26,WHITMORE,"And therefore to revenge it, shalt thou die,"
8347,Henry VI Part 2,7,,WHITMORE,To SUFFOLK
8348,Henry VI Part 2,7,4.1.27,WHITMORE,"And so should these, if I might have my will."

8350,Henry VI Part 2,9,4.1.29,SUFFOLK,"Look on my George, I am a gentleman:"
8351,Henry VI Part 2,9,4.1.30,SUFFOLK,"Rate me at what thou wilt, thou shalt be paid."
8352,Henry VI Part 2,10,4.1.31,WHITMORE,"And so am I, my name is Walter Whitmore."
8353,Henry VI Part 2,10,4.1.32,WHITMORE,"How now! why start'st thou? what, doth"
8354,Henry VI Part 2,10,4.1.33,WHITMORE,death affright?
8355,Henry VI Part 2,11,4.1.34,SUFFOLK,"Thy name affrights me, in whose sound is death."
8356,Henry VI Part 2,11,4.1.35,SUFFOLK,A cunning man did calculate my birth
8357,Henry VI Part 2,11,4.1.36,SUFFOLK,And told me that by water I should die:

8359,Henry VI Part 2,11,4.1.38,SUFFOLK,"Thy name is Gaultier, being rightly sounded."
8360,Henry VI Part 2,12,4.1.39,WHITMORE,"Gaultier or Walter, which it is, I care not:"
8361,Henry VI Part 2,12,4.1.40,WHITMORE,"Never yet did base dishonour blur our name,"
8362,Henry VI Part 2,12,4.1.41,WHITMORE,"But with our sword we wiped away the blot,"
8363,Henry VI Part 2,12,4.1.42,WHITMORE,"Therefore, when merchant-like I sell revenge,"
8364,Henry VI Part 2,12,4.1.43,WHITMORE,"Broke be my sword, my arms torn and defaced,"
8365,Henry VI Part 2,12,4.1.44,WHITMORE,And I proclaim'd a coward through the world!
8366,Henry VI Part 2,13,4.1.45,SUFFOLK,"Stay, Whitmore, for thy prisoner is a prince,"
8367,Henry VI Part 2,13,4.1.46,SUFFOLK,"The Duke of Suffolk, William de la Pole."
8368,Henry VI Part 2,14,4.1.47,WHITMORE,The Duke of Suffolk muffled up in rags!
8369,Henry VI Part 2,15,4.1.48,SUFFOLK,"Ay, but these rags are no part of the duke:"
8370,Henry VI Part 2,15,4.1.49,SUFFOLK,"Jove sometimes went disguised, and why not I?"
8371,Henry VI Part 2,16,4.1.50,Captain,"But Jove was never slain, as thou shalt be."
8372,Henry VI Part 2,17,4.1.51,SUFFOLK,"Obscure and lowly swain, King Henry's blood,"
8373,Henry VI Part 2,17,4.1.52,SUFFOLK,"The honourable blood of Lancaster,"
8374,Henry VI Part 2,17,4.1.53,SUFFOLK,Must not be shed by such a jaded groom.
8375,Henry VI Part 2,17,4.1.54,SUFFOLK,Hast thou not kiss'd thy hand and held my stirrup?
8376,Henry VI Part 2,17,4.1.55,SUFFOLK,Bare-headed plodded by my foot-cloth mule
8377,Henry VI Part 2,17,4.1.56,SUFFOLK,And thought thee happy when I shook my head?
8378,Henry VI Part 2,17,4.1.57,SUFFOLK,"How often hast thou waited at my cup,"
8379,Henry VI Part 2,17,4.1.58,SUFFOLK,"Fed from my trencher, kneel'd down at the board."
8380,Henry VI Part 2,17,4.1.59,SUFFOLK,When I have feasted with Queen Margaret?
8381,Henry VI Part 2,17,4.1.60,SUFFOLK,"Remember it and let it make thee crest-fall'n,"
8382,Henry VI Part 2,17,4.1.61,SUFFOLK,"Ay, and allay this thy abortive pride,"
8383,Henry VI Part 2,17,4.1.62,SUFFOLK,How in our voiding lobby hast thou stood
8384,Henry VI Part 2,17,4.1.63,SUFFOLK,And duly waited for my coming forth?
8385,Henry VI Part 2,17,4.1.64,SUFFOLK,"This hand of mine hath writ in thy behalf,"
8386,Henry VI Part 2,17,4.1.65,SUFFOLK,And therefore shall it charm thy riotous tongue.
8387,Henry VI Part 2,18,4.1.66,WHITMORE,"Speak, captain, shall I stab the forlorn swain?"
8388,Henry VI Part 2,19,4.1.67,Captain,"First let my words stab him, as he hath me."
8389,Henry VI Part 2,20,4.1.68,SUFFOLK,"Base slave, thy words are blunt and so art thou."
8390,Henry VI Part 2,21,4.1.69,Captain,Convey him hence and on our longboat's side
8391,Henry VI Part 2,21,4.1.70,Captain,Strike off his head.
8392,Henry VI Part 2,22,4.1.71,SUFFOLK,"Thou darest not, for thy own."
8393,Henry VI Part 2,23,4.1.72,Captain,"Yes, Pole."
8394,Henry VI Part 2,24,4.1.73,SUFFOLK,Pole!
8395,Henry VI Part 2,25,4.1.74,Captain,Pool! Sir Pool! lord!
8396,Henry VI Part 2,25,4.1.75,Captain,"Ay, kennel, puddle, sink, whose filth and dirt"
8397,Henry VI Part 2,25,4.1.76,Captain,Troubles the silver spring where England drinks.
8398,Henry VI Part 2,25,4.1.77,Captain,Now will I dam up this thy yawning mouth
8399,Henry VI Part 2,25,4.1.78,Captain,For swallowing the treasure of the realm:
8400,Henry VI Part 2,25,4.1.79,Captain,"Thy lips that kiss'd the queen shall sweep the ground,"
8401,Henry VI Part 2,25,4.1.80,Captain,"And thou that smiledst at good Duke Humphrey's death,"
8402,Henry VI Part 2,25,4.1.81,Captain,"Against the senseless winds shalt grin in vain,"
8403,Henry VI Part 2,25,4.1.82,Captain,Who in contempt shall hiss at thee again:
8404,Henry VI Part 2,25,4.1.83,Captain,"And wedded be thou to the hags of hell,"
8405,Henry VI Part 2,25,4.1.84,Captain,For daring to affy a mighty lord
8406,Henry VI Part 2,25,4.1.85,Captain,"Unto the daughter of a worthless king,"
8407,Henry VI Part 2,25,4.1.86,Captain,"Having neither subject, wealth, nor diadem."
8408,Henry VI Part 2,25,4.1.87,Captain,"By devilish policy art thou grown great,"
8409,Henry VI Part 2,25,4.1.88,Captain,"And, like ambitious Sylla, overgorged"
8410,Henry VI Part 2,25,4.1.89,Captain,With gobbets of thy mother's bleeding heart.
8411,Henry VI Part 2,25,4.1.90,Captain,"By thee Anjou and Maine were sold to France,"
8412,Henry VI Part 2,25,4.1.91,Captain,The false revolting Normans thorough thee
8413,Henry VI Part 2,25,4.1.92,Captain,"Disdain to call us lord, and Picardy"
8414,Henry VI Part 2,25,4.1.93,Captain,"Hath slain their governors, surprised our forts,"
8415,Henry VI Part 2,25,4.1.94,Captain,And sent the ragged soldiers wounded home.
8416,Henry VI Part 2,25,4.1.95,Captain,"The princely Warwick, and the Nevils all,"
8417,Henry VI Part 2,25,4.1.96,Captain,"Whose dreadful swords were never drawn in vain,"
8418,Henry VI Part 2,25,4.1.97,Captain,"As hating thee, are rising up in arms:"
8419,Henry VI Part 2,25,4.1.98,Captain,"And now the house of York, thrust from the crown"
8420,Henry VI Part 2,25,4.1.99,Captain,By shameful murder of a guiltless king
8421,Henry VI Part 2,25,4.1.100,Captain,"And lofty proud encroaching tyranny,"
8422,Henry VI Part 2,25,4.1.101,Captain,"Burns with revenging fire, whose hopeful colours"
8423,Henry VI Part 2,25,4.1.102,Captain,"Advance our half-faced sun, striving to shine,"
8424,Henry VI Part 2,25,4.1.103,Captain,Under the which is writ 'Invitis nubibus.'
8425,Henry VI Part 2,25,4.1.104,Captain,The commons here in Kent are up in arms:
8426,Henry VI Part 2,25,4.1.105,Captain,"And, to conclude, reproach and beggary"
8427,Henry VI Part 2,25,4.1.106,Captain,Is crept into the palace of our king.
8428,Henry VI Part 2,25,4.1.107,Captain,And all by thee. Away! convey him hence.
8429,Henry VI Part 2,26,4.1.108,SUFFOLK,"O that I were a god, to shoot forth thunder"
8430,Henry VI Part 2,26,4.1.109,SUFFOLK,"Upon these paltry, servile, abject drudges!"
8431,Henry VI Part 2,26,4.1.110,SUFFOLK,"Small things make base men proud: this villain here,"
8432,Henry VI Part 2,26,4.1.111,SUFFOLK,"Being captain of a pinnace, threatens more"
8433,Henry VI Part 2,26,4.1.112,SUFFOLK,Than Bargulus the strong Illyrian pirate.
8434,Henry VI Part 2,26,4.1.113,SUFFOLK,Drones suck not eagles' blood but rob beehives:
8435,Henry VI Part 2,26,4.1.114,SUFFOLK,It is impossible that I should die
8436,Henry VI Part 2,26,4.1.115,SUFFOLK,By such a lowly vassal as thyself.
8437,Henry VI Part 2,26,4.1.116,SUFFOLK,Thy words move rage and not remorse in me:
8438,Henry VI Part 2,26,4.1.117,SUFFOLK,"I go of message from the queen to France,"
8439,Henry VI Part 2,26,4.1.118,SUFFOLK,I charge thee waft me safely cross the Channel.
8440,Henry VI Part 2,27,4.1.119,Captain,"Walter,--"
8441,Henry VI Part 2,28,4.1.120,WHITMORE,"Come, Suffolk, I must waft thee to thy death."
8442,Henry VI Part 2,29,4.1.121,SUFFOLK,Gelidus timor occupat artus it is thee I fear.
8443,Henry VI Part 2,30,4.1.122,WHITMORE,Thou shalt have cause to fear before I leave thee.
8444,Henry VI Part 2,30,4.1.123,WHITMORE,"What, are ye daunted now? now will ye stoop?"
8445,Henry VI Part 2,31,4.1.124,First Gentleman,"My gracious lord, entreat him, speak him fair."
8446,Henry VI Part 2,32,4.1.125,SUFFOLK,"Suffolk's imperial tongue is stern and rough,"
8447,Henry VI Part 2,32,4.1.126,SUFFOLK,"Used to command, untaught to plead for favour."
8448,Henry VI Part 2,32,4.1.127,SUFFOLK,Far be it we should honour such as these
8449,Henry VI Part 2,32,4.1.128,SUFFOLK,"With humble suit: no, rather let my head"
8450,Henry VI Part 2,32,4.1.129,SUFFOLK,Stoop to the block than these knees bow to any
8451,Henry VI Part 2,32,4.1.130,SUFFOLK,"Save to the God of heaven and to my king,"
8452,Henry VI Part 2,32,4.1.131,SUFFOLK,And sooner dance upon a bloody pole
8453,Henry VI Part 2,32,4.1.132,SUFFOLK,Than stand uncover'd to the vulgar groom.
8454,Henry VI Part 2,32,4.1.133,SUFFOLK,True nobility is exempt from fear:
8455,Henry VI Part 2,32,4.1.134,SUFFOLK,More can I bear than you dare execute.
8456,Henry VI Part 2,33,4.1.135,Captain,"Hale him away, and let him talk no more."
8457,Henry VI Part 2,34,4.1.136,SUFFOLK,"Come, soldiers, show what cruelty ye can,"
8458,Henry VI Part 2,34,4.1.137,SUFFOLK,That this my death may never be forgot!
8459,Henry VI Part 2,34,4.1.138,SUFFOLK,Great men oft die by vile bezonians:
8460,Henry VI Part 2,34,4.1.139,SUFFOLK,A Roman sworder and banditto slave
8461,Henry VI Part 2,34,4.1.140,SUFFOLK,"Murder'd sweet Tully, Brutus' bastard hand"
8462,Henry VI Part 2,34,4.1.141,SUFFOLK,"Stabb'd Julius Caesar, savage islanders"

8464,Henry VI Part 2,34,,SUFFOLK,Exeunt Whitmore and others with Suffolk
8465,Henry VI Part 2,35,4.1.143,Captain,"And as for these whose ransom we have set,"
8466,Henry VI Part 2,35,4.1.144,Captain,"It is our pleasure one of them depart,"
8467,Henry VI Part 2,35,4.1.145,Captain,Therefore come you with us and let him go.
8468,Henry VI Part 2,35,,Captain,Exeunt all but the First Gentleman
8469,Henry VI Part 2,35,,Captain,Re-enter WHITMORE with SUFFOLK's body
8470,Henry VI Part 2,36,4.1.146,WHITMORE,"There let his head and lifeless body lie,"
8471,Henry VI Part 2,36,4.1.147,WHITMORE,Until the queen his mistress bury it.
8472,Henry VI Part 2,36,,WHITMORE,Exit
8473,Henry VI Part 2,37,4.1.148,First Gentleman,O barbarous and bloody spectacle!
8474,Henry VI Part 2,37,4.1.149,First Gentleman,His body will I bear unto the king:
8475,Henry VI Part 2,37,4.1.150,First Gentleman,"If he revenge it not, yet will his friends,"
8476,Henry VI Part 2,37,4.1.151,First Gentleman,"So will the queen, that living held him dear."
8477,Henry VI Part 2,37,,First Gentleman,Exit with the body
8478,Henry VI Part 2,37,,First Gentleman,SCENE II. Blackheath.
8479,Henry VI Part 2,37,,First Gentleman,Enter GEORGE BEVIS and JOHN HOLLAND
8480,Henry VI Part 2,1,4.2.1,BEVIS,"Come, and get thee a sword, though made of a lath,"
8481,Henry VI Part 2,1,4.2.2,BEVIS,they have been up these two days.
8482,Henry VI Part 2,2,4.2.3,HOLLAND,"They have the more need to sleep now, then."
8483,Henry VI Part 2,3,4.2.4,BEVIS,"I tell thee, Jack Cade the clothier means to dress"
8484,Henry VI Part 2,3,4.2.5,BEVIS,"the commonwealth, and turn it, and set a new nap upon it."
8485,Henry VI Part 2,4,4.2.6,HOLLAND,"So he had need, for 'tis threadbare. Well, I say it"
8486,Henry VI Part 2,4,4.2.7,HOLLAND,was never merry world in England since gentlemen came up.
8487,Henry VI Part 2,5,4.2.8,BEVIS,O miserable age! virtue is not regarded in handicrafts-men.
8488,Henry VI Part 2,6,4.2.9,HOLLAND,The nobility think scorn to go in leather aprons.
8489,Henry VI Part 2,7,4.2.10,BEVIS,"Nay, more, the king's council are no good workmen."
8490,Henry VI Part 2,8,4.2.11,HOLLAND,"True, and yet it is said, labour in thy vocation,"
8491,Henry VI Part 2,8,4.2.12,HOLLAND,"which is as much to say as, let the magistrates be"
8492,Henry VI Part 2,8,4.2.13,HOLLAND,"labouring men, and therefore should we be"
8493,Henry VI Part 2,8,4.2.14,HOLLAND,magistrates.
8494,Henry VI Part 2,9,4.2.15,BEVIS,"Thou hast hit it, for there's no better sign of a"
8495,Henry VI Part 2,9,4.2.16,BEVIS,brave mind than a hard hand.
8496,Henry VI Part 2,10,4.2.17,HOLLAND,"I see them! I see them! there's Best's son, the"
8497,Henry VI Part 2,10,4.2.18,HOLLAND,"tanner of Wingham,--"

8500,Henry VI Part 2,12,4.2.21,HOLLAND,"And Dick the Butcher,--"
8501,Henry VI Part 2,13,4.2.22,BEVIS,"Then is sin struck down like an ox, and iniquity's"
8502,Henry VI Part 2,13,4.2.23,BEVIS,throat cut like a calf.
8503,Henry VI Part 2,14,4.2.24,HOLLAND,"And Smith the weaver,--"
8504,Henry VI Part 2,15,4.2.25,BEVIS,"Argo, their thread of life is spun."
8505,Henry VI Part 2,16,4.2.26,HOLLAND,"Come, come, let's fall in with them."
8506,Henry VI Part 2,16,,HOLLAND,"Drum. Enter CADE, DICK the Butcher, SMITH the Weaver, and a Sawyer, with infinite numbers"

8514,Henry VI Part 2,22,4.2.34,DICK,"[Aside]  He was an honest man, and a good"
8515,Henry VI Part 2,22,4.2.35,DICK,bricklayer.
8516,Henry VI Part 2,23,4.2.36,CADE,"My mother a Plantagenet,--"
8517,Henry VI Part 2,24,4.2.37,DICK,"[Aside]  I knew her well, she was a midwife."
8518,Henry VI Part 2,25,4.2.38,CADE,"My wife descended of the Lacies,--"
8519,Henry VI Part 2,26,4.2.39,DICK,"[Aside]  She was, indeed, a pedler's daughter, and"

8522,Henry VI Part 2,27,4.2.42,SMITH,"furred pack, she washes bucks here at home."
8523,Henry VI Part 2,28,4.2.43,CADE,Therefore am I of an honourable house.
8524,Henry VI Part 2,29,4.2.44,DICK,"[Aside]  Ay, by my faith, the field is honourable,"
8525,Henry VI Part 2,29,4.2.45,DICK,"and there was he borne, under a hedge, for his"
8526,Henry VI Part 2,29,4.2.46,DICK,father had never a house but the cage.
8527,Henry VI Part 2,30,4.2.47,CADE,Valiant I am.
8528,Henry VI Part 2,31,4.2.48,SMITH,"[Aside]  A' must needs, for beggary is valiant."
8529,Henry VI Part 2,32,4.2.49,CADE,I am able to endure much.
8530,Henry VI Part 2,33,4.2.50,DICK,"[Aside]  No question of that, for I have seen him"

8532,Henry VI Part 2,34,4.2.52,CADE,I fear neither sword nor fire.
8533,Henry VI Part 2,35,4.2.53,SMITH,"[Aside]  He need not fear the sword, for his coat is of proof."
8534,Henry VI Part 2,36,4.2.54,DICK,[Aside]  But methinks he should stand in fear of

8815,Henry VI Part 2,11,4.7.23,CADE,art thou within point-blank of our jurisdiction
8816,Henry VI Part 2,11,4.7.24,CADE,regal. What canst thou answer to my majesty for

8859,Henry VI Part 2,19,4.7.67,SAY,"Large gifts have I bestow'd on learned clerks,"

9021,Henry VI Part 2,5,4.9.20,KING HENRY VI,"And so, with thanks and pardon to you all,"
9022,Henry VI Part 2,5,4.9.21,KING HENRY VI,I do dismiss you to your several countries.
9023,Henry VI Part 2,6,4.9.22,ALL,God save the king! God save the king!
9024,Henry VI Part 2,6,,ALL,Enter a Messenger
9025,Henry VI Part 2,7,4.9.23,Messenger,Please it your grace to be advertised
9026,Henry VI Part 2,7,4.9.24,Messenger,"The Duke of York is newly come from Ireland,"
9027,Henry VI Part 2,7,4.9.25,Messenger,And with a puissant and a mighty power
9028,Henry VI Part 2,7,4.9.26,Messenger,Of gallowglasses and stout kerns
9029,Henry VI Part 2,7,4.9.27,Messenger,"Is marching hitherward in proud array,"
9030,Henry VI Part 2,7,4.9.28,Messenger,"And still proclaimeth, as he comes along,"
9031,Henry VI Part 2,7,4.9.29,Messenger,His arms are only to remove from thee
9032,Henry VI Part 2,7,4.9.30,Messenger,"The Duke of Somerset, whom he terms traitor."
9033,Henry VI Part 2,8,4.9.31,KING HENRY VI,"Thus stands my state, 'twixt Cade and York distress'd."
9034,Henry VI Part 2,8,4.9.32,KING HENRY VI,"Like to a ship that, having 'scaped a tempest,"
9035,Henry VI Part 2,8,4.9.33,KING HENRY VI,Is straightway calm'd and boarded with a pirate:
9036,Henry VI Part 2,8,4.9.34,KING HENRY VI,"But now is Cade driven back, his men dispersed,"
9037,Henry VI Part 2,8,4.9.35,KING HENRY VI,And now is York in arms to second him.
9038,Henry VI Part 2,8,4.9.36,KING HENRY VI,"I pray thee, Buckingham, go and meet him,"
9039,Henry VI Part 2,8,4.9.37,KING HENRY VI,And ask him what's the reason of these arms.
9040,Henry VI Part 2,8,4.9.38,KING HENRY VI,"Tell him I'll send Duke Edmund to the Tower,"
9041,Henry VI Part 2,8,4.9.39,KING HENRY VI,"And, Somerset, we'll commit thee thither,"
9042,Henry VI Part 2,8,4.9.40,KING HENRY VI,Until his army be dismiss'd from him.
9043,Henry VI Part 2,9,4.9.41,SOMERSET,"My lord,"
9044,Henry VI Part 2,9,4.9.42,SOMERSET,"I'll yield myself to prison willingly,"
9045,Henry VI Part 2,9,4.9.43,SOMERSET,"Or unto death, to do my country good."
9046,Henry VI Part 2,10,4.9.44,KING HENRY VI,"In any case, be not too rough in terms,"
9047,Henry VI Part 2,10,4.9.45,KING HENRY VI,For he is fierce and cannot brook hard language.
9048,Henry VI Part 2,11,4.9.46,BUCKINGHAM,"I will, my lord, and doubt not so to deal"
9049,Henry VI Part 2,11,4.9.47,BUCKINGHAM,As all things shall redound unto your good.
9050,Henry VI Part 2,12,4.9.48,KING HENRY VI,"Come, wife, let's in, and learn to govern better,"
9051,Henry VI Part 2,12,4.9.49,KING HENRY VI,For yet may England curse my wretched reign.
9052,Henry VI Part 2,12,,KING HENRY VI,Flourish. Exeunt
9053,Henry VI Part 2,12,,KING HENRY VI,SCENE X. Kent. IDEN's garden.
9054,Henry VI Part 2,12,,KING HENRY VI,Enter CADE
9055,Henry VI Part 2,1,4.10.1,CADE,"Fie on ambition! fie on myself, that have a sword,"
9056,Henry VI Part 2,1,4.10.2,CADE,and yet am ready to famish! These five days have I
9057,Henry VI Part 2,1,4.10.3,CADE,"hid me in these woods and durst not peep out, for"
9058,Henry VI Part 2,1,4.10.4,CADE,"all the country is laid for me, but now am I so"
9059,Henry VI Part 2,1,4.10.5,CADE,hungry that if I might have a lease of my life for a
9060,Henry VI Part 2,1,4.10.6,CADE,"thousand years I could stay no longer. Wherefore,"
9061,Henry VI Part 2,1,4.10.7,CADE,"on a brick wall have I climbed into this garden, to"
9062,Henry VI Part 2,1,4.10.8,CADE,"see if I can eat grass, or pick a sallet another"
9063,Henry VI Part 2,1,4.10.9,CADE,"while, which is not amiss to cool a man's stomach"
9064,Henry VI Part 2,1,4.10.10,CADE,this hot weather. And I think this word 'sallet'
9065,Henry VI Part 2,1,4.10.11,CADE,"was born to do me good: for many a time, but for a"
9066,Henry VI Part 2,1,4.10.12,CADE,"sallet, my brainpan had been cleft with a brown"
9067,Henry VI Part 2,1,4.10.13,CADE,"bill, and many a time, when I have been dry and"
9068,Henry VI Part 2,1,4.10.14,CADE,"bravely marching, it hath served me instead of a"
9069,Henry VI Part 2,1,4.10.15,CADE,"quart pot to drink in, and now the word 'sallet'"
9070,Henry VI Part 2,1,4.10.16,CADE,must serve me to feed on.
9071,Henry VI Part 2,1,,CADE,Enter IDEN
9072,Henry VI Part 2,2,4.10.17,IDEN,"Lord, who would live turmoiled in the court,"
9073,Henry VI Part 2,2,4.10.18,IDEN,And may enjoy such quiet walks as these?
9074,Henry VI Part 2,2,4.10.19,IDEN,This small inheritance my father left me
9075,Henry VI Part 2,2,4.10.20,IDEN,"Contenteth me, and worth a monarchy."
9076,Henry VI Part 2,2,4.10.21,IDEN,"I seek not to wax great by others' waning,"
9077,Henry VI Part 2,2,4.10.22,IDEN,"Or gather wealth, I care not, with what envy:"
9078,Henry VI Part 2,2,4.10.23,IDEN,Sufficeth that I have maintains my state
9079,Henry VI Part 2,2,4.10.24,IDEN,And sends the poor well pleased from my gate.
9080,Henry VI Part 2,3,4.10.25,CADE,Here's the lord of the soil come to seize me for a
9081,Henry VI Part 2,3,4.10.26,CADE,"stray, for entering his fee-simple without leave."
9082,Henry VI Part 2,3,4.10.27,CADE,"Ah, villain, thou wilt betray me, and get a thousand"
9083,Henry VI Part 2,3,4.10.28,CADE,crowns of the king carrying my head to him: but
9084,Henry VI Part 2,3,4.10.29,CADE,"I'll make thee eat iron like an ostrich, and swallow"
9085,Henry VI Part 2,3,4.10.30,CADE,"my sword like a great pin, ere thou and I part."
9086,Henry VI Part 2,4,4.10.31,IDEN,"Why, rude companion, whatsoe'er thou be,"
9087,Henry VI Part 2,4,4.10.32,IDEN,"I know thee not, why, then, should I betray thee?"
9088,Henry VI Part 2,4,4.10.33,IDEN,"Is't not enough to break into my garden,"
9089,Henry VI Part 2,4,4.10.34,IDEN,"And, like a thief, to come to rob my grounds,"
9090,Henry VI Part 2,4,4.10.35,IDEN,"Climbing my walls in spite of me the owner,"
9091,Henry VI Part 2,4,4.10.36,IDEN,But thou wilt brave me with these saucy terms?
9092,Henry VI Part 2,5,4.10.37,CADE,"Brave thee! ay, by the best blood that ever was"
9093,Henry VI Part 2,5,4.10.38,CADE,"broached, and beard thee too. Look on me well: I"
9094,Henry VI Part 2,5,4.10.39,CADE,"have eat no meat these five days, yet, come thou and"
9095,Henry VI Part 2,5,4.10.40,CADE,"thy five men, and if I do not leave you all as dead"
9096,Henry VI Part 2,5,4.10.41,CADE,"as a doornail, I pray God I may never eat grass more."
9097,Henry VI Part 2,6,4.10.42,IDEN,"Nay, it shall ne'er be said, while England stands,"
9098,Henry VI Part 2,6,4.10.43,IDEN,"That Alexander Iden, an esquire of Kent,"
9099,Henry VI Part 2,6,4.10.44,IDEN,Took odds to combat a poor famish'd man.
9100,Henry VI Part 2,6,4.10.45,IDEN,"Oppose thy steadfast-gazing eyes to mine,"
9101,Henry VI Part 2,6,4.10.46,IDEN,See if thou canst outface me with thy looks:
9102,Henry VI Part 2,6,4.10.47,IDEN,"Set limb to limb, and thou art far the lesser,"
9103,Henry VI Part 2,6,4.10.48,IDEN,"Thy hand is but a finger to my fist,"
9104,Henry VI Part 2,6,4.10.49,IDEN,"Thy leg a stick compared with this truncheon,"
9105,Henry VI Part 2,6,4.10.50,IDEN,"My foot shall fight with all the strength thou hast,"
9106,Henry VI Part 2,6,4.10.51,IDEN,"And if mine arm be heaved in the air,"
9107,Henry VI Part 2,6,4.10.52,IDEN,Thy grave is digg'd already in the earth.
9108,Henry VI Part 2,6,4.10.53,IDEN,"As for words, whose greatness answers words,"
9109,Henry VI Part 2,6,4.10.54,IDEN,Let this my sword report what speech forbears.
9110,Henry VI Part 2,7,4.10.55,CADE,"By my valour, the most complete champion that ever I"
9111,Henry VI Part 2,7,4.10.56,CADE,"heard! Steel, if thou turn the edge, or cut not out"
9112,Henry VI Part 2,7,4.10.57,CADE,the burly-boned clown in chines of beef ere thou
9113,Henry VI Part 2,7,4.10.58,CADE,"sleep in thy sheath, I beseech God on my knees thou"
9114,Henry VI Part 2,7,4.10.59,CADE,mayst be turned to hobnails.
9115,Henry VI Part 2,7,,CADE,Here they fight. CADE falls
9116,Henry VI Part 2,7,4.10.60,CADE,"O, I am slain! famine and no other hath slain me:"
9117,Henry VI Part 2,7,4.10.61,CADE,"let ten thousand devils come against me, and give me"
9118,Henry VI Part 2,7,4.10.62,CADE,"but the ten meals I have lost, and I'll defy them"
9119,Henry VI Part 2,7,4.10.63,CADE,"all. Wither, garden, and be henceforth a"
9120,Henry VI Part 2,7,4.10.64,CADE,"burying-place to all that do dwell in this house,"
9121,Henry VI Part 2,7,4.10.65,CADE,because the unconquered soul of Cade is fled.
9122,Henry VI Part 2,8,4.10.66,IDEN,"Is't Cade that I have slain, that monstrous traitor?"
9123,Henry VI Part 2,8,4.10.67,IDEN,"Sword, I will hollow thee for this thy deed,"
9124,Henry VI Part 2,8,4.10.68,IDEN,And hang thee o'er my tomb when I am dead:
9125,Henry VI Part 2,8,4.10.69,IDEN,"Ne'er shall this blood be wiped from thy point,"
9126,Henry VI Part 2,8,4.10.70,IDEN,"But thou shalt wear it as a herald's coat,"
9127,Henry VI Part 2,8,4.10.71,IDEN,To emblaze the honour that thy master got.
9128,Henry VI Part 2,9,4.10.72,CADE,"Iden, farewell, and be proud of thy victory. Tell"
9129,Henry VI Part 2,9,4.10.73,CADE,"Kent from me, she hath lost her best man, and exhort"
9130,Henry VI Part 2,9,4.10.74,CADE,"all the world to be cowards, for I, that never"
9131,Henry VI Part 2,9,4.10.75,CADE,"feared any, am vanquished by famine, not by valour."
9132,Henry VI Part 2,9,,CADE,Dies
9133,Henry VI Part 2,10,4.10.76,IDEN,"How much thou wrong'st me, heaven be my judge."
9134,Henry VI Part 2,10,4.10.77,IDEN,"Die, damned wretch, the curse of her that bare thee,"
9135,Henry VI Part 2,10,4.10.78,IDEN,"And as I thrust thy body in with my sword,"
9136,Henry VI Part 2,10,4.10.79,IDEN,"So wish I, I might thrust thy soul to hell."
9137,Henry VI Part 2,10,4.10.80,IDEN,Hence will I drag thee headlong by the heels
9138,Henry VI Part 2,10,4.10.81,IDEN,"Unto a dunghill which shall be thy grave,"
9139,Henry VI Part 2,10,4.10.82,IDEN,"And there cut off thy most ungracious head,"
9140,Henry VI Part 2,10,4.10.83,IDEN,"Which I will bear in triumph to the king,"
9141,Henry VI Part 2,10,4.10.84,IDEN,Leaving thy trunk for crows to feed upon.
9142,Henry VI Part 2,10,,IDEN,Exit
9143,Henry VI Part 2,10,,IDEN,ACT V
9144,Henry VI Part 2,10,,IDEN,SCENE I. Fields between Dartford and Blackheath.
9145,Henry VI Part 2,10,,IDEN,"Enter YORK, and his army of Irish, with drum and colours"
9146,Henry VI Part 2,1,5.1.1,YORK,"From Ireland thus comes York to claim his right,"
9147,Henry VI Part 2,1,5.1.2,YORK,And pluck the crown from feeble Henry's head:
9148,Henry VI Part 2,1,5.1.3,YORK,"Ring, bells, aloud, burn, bonfires, clear and bright,"
9149,Henry VI Part 2,1,5.1.4,YORK,To entertain great England's lawful king.
9150,Henry VI Part 2,1,5.1.5,YORK,"Ah! sancta majestas, who would not buy thee dear?"
9151,Henry VI Part 2,1,5.1.6,YORK,"Let them obey that know not how to rule,"
9152,Henry VI Part 2,1,5.1.7,YORK,This hand was made to handle naught but gold.
9153,Henry VI Part 2,1,5.1.8,YORK,"I cannot give due action to my words,"
9154,Henry VI Part 2,1,5.1.9,YORK,Except a sword or sceptre balance it:
9155,Henry VI Part 2,1,5.1.10,YORK,"A sceptre shall it have, have I a soul,"
9156,Henry VI Part 2,1,5.1.11,YORK,On which I'll toss the flower-de-luce of France.
9157,Henry VI Part 2,1,,YORK,Enter BUCKINGHAM
9158,Henry VI Part 2,1,5.1.12,YORK,"Whom have we here? Buckingham, to disturb me?"
9159,Henry VI Part 2,1,5.1.13,YORK,"The king hath sent him, sure: I must dissemble."
9160,Henry VI Part 2,2,5.1.14,BUCKINGHAM,"York, if thou meanest well, I greet thee well."
9161,Henry VI Part 2,3,5.1.15,YORK,"Humphrey of Buckingham, I accept thy greeting."
9162,Henry VI Part 2,3,5.1.16,YORK,"Art thou a messenger, or come of pleasure?"
9163,Henry VI Part 2,4,5.1.17,BUCKINGHAM,"A messenger from Henry, our dread liege,"
9164,Henry VI Part 2,4,5.1.18,BUCKINGHAM,"To know the reason of these arms in peace,"
9165,Henry VI Part 2,4,5.1.19,BUCKINGHAM,"Or why thou, being a subject as I am,"
9166,Henry VI Part 2,4,5.1.20,BUCKINGHAM,"Against thy oath and true allegiance sworn,"
9167,Henry VI Part 2,4,5.1.21,BUCKINGHAM,"Should raise so great a power without his leave,"
9168,Henry VI Part 2,4,5.1.22,BUCKINGHAM,Or dare to bring thy force so near the court.
9169,Henry VI Part 2,5,5.1.23,YORK,"[Aside]  Scarce can I speak, my choler is so great:"
9170,Henry VI Part 2,5,5.1.24,YORK,"O, I could hew up rocks and fight with flint,"
9171,Henry VI Part 2,5,5.1.25,YORK,"I am so angry at these abject terms,"
9172,Henry VI Part 2,5,5.1.26,YORK,"And now, like Ajax Telamonius,"
9173,Henry VI Part 2,5,5.1.27,YORK,On sheep or oxen could I spend my fury.
9174,Henry VI Part 2,5,5.1.28,YORK,"I am far better born than is the king,"
9175,Henry VI Part 2,5,5.1.29,YORK,"More like a king, more kingly in my thoughts:"
9176,Henry VI Part 2,5,5.1.30,YORK,"But I must make fair weather yet a while,"
9177,Henry VI Part 2,5,5.1.31,YORK,"Till Henry be more weak and I more strong,--"
9178,Henry VI Part 2,5,5.1.32,YORK,"Buckingham, I prithee, pardon me,"
9179,Henry VI Part 2,5,5.1.33,YORK,"That I have given no answer all this while,"
9180,Henry VI Part 2,5,5.1.34,YORK,My mind was troubled with deep melancholy.
9181,Henry VI Part 2,5,5.1.35,YORK,The cause why I have brought this army hither
9182,Henry VI Part 2,5,5.1.36,YORK,"Is to remove proud Somerset from the king,"
9183,Henry VI Part 2,5,5.1.37,YORK,Seditious to his grace and to the state.
9184,Henry VI Part 2,6,5.1.38,BUCKINGHAM,That is too much presumption on thy part:
9185,Henry VI Part 2,6,5.1.39,BUCKINGHAM,"But if thy arms be to no other end,"
9186,Henry VI Part 2,6,5.1.40,BUCKINGHAM,The king hath yielded unto thy demand:
9187,Henry VI Part 2,6,5.1.41,BUCKINGHAM,The Duke of Somerset is in the Tower.
9188,Henry VI Part 2,7,5.1.42,YORK,"Upon thine honour, is he prisoner?"
9189,Henry VI Part 2,8,5.1.43,BUCKINGHAM,"Upon mine honour, he is prisoner."
9190,Henry VI Part 2,9,5.1.44,YORK,"Then, Buckingham, I do dismiss my powers."
9191,Henry VI Part 2,9,5.1.45,YORK,"Soldiers, I thank you all, disperse yourselves,"
9192,Henry VI Part 2,9,5.1.46,YORK,"Meet me to-morrow in St. George's field,"
9193,Henry VI Part 2,9,5.1.47,YORK,You shall have pay and every thing you wish.
9194,Henry VI Part 2,9,5.1.48,YORK,"And let my sovereign, virtuous Henry,"
9195,Henry VI Part 2,9,5.1.49,YORK,"Command my eldest son, nay, all my sons,"
9196,Henry VI Part 2,9,5.1.50,YORK,"As pledges of my fealty and love,"
9197,Henry VI Part 2,9,5.1.51,YORK,I'll send them all as willing as I live:
9198,Henry VI Part 2,9,5.1.52,YORK,"Lands, goods, horse, armour, any thing I have,"
9199,Henry VI Part 2,9,5.1.53,YORK,"Is his to use, so Somerset may die."
9200,Henry VI Part 2,10,5.1.54,BUCKINGHAM,"York, I commend this kind submission:"
9201,Henry VI Part 2,10,5.1.55,BUCKINGHAM,We twain will go into his highness' tent.
9202,Henry VI Part 2,10,,BUCKINGHAM,Enter KING HENRY VI and Attendants
9203,Henry VI Part 2,11,5.1.56,KING HENRY VI,"Buckingham, doth York intend no harm to us,"
9204,Henry VI Part 2,11,5.1.57,KING HENRY VI,That thus he marcheth with thee arm in arm?
9205,Henry VI Part 2,12,5.1.58,YORK,In all submission and humility
9206,Henry VI Part 2,12,5.1.59,YORK,York doth present himself unto your highness.
9207,Henry VI Part 2,13,5.1.60,KING HENRY VI,Then what intends these forces thou dost bring?
9208,Henry VI Part 2,14,5.1.61,YORK,"To heave the traitor Somerset from hence,"
9209,Henry VI Part 2,14,5.1.62,YORK,"And fight against that monstrous rebel Cade,"
9210,Henry VI Part 2,14,5.1.63,YORK,Who since I heard to be discomfited.
9211,Henry VI Part 2,14,,YORK,"Enter IDEN, with CADE'S head"
9212,Henry VI Part 2,15,5.1.64,IDEN,If one so rude and of so mean condition
9213,Henry VI Part 2,15,5.1.65,IDEN,"May pass into the presence of a king,"
9214,Henry VI Part 2,15,5.1.66,IDEN,"Lo, I present your grace a traitor's head,"
9215,Henry VI Part 2,15,5.1.67,IDEN,"The head of Cade, whom I in combat slew."
9216,Henry VI Part 2,16,5.1.68,KING HENRY VI,"The head of Cade! Great God, how just art Thou!"
9217,Henry VI Part 2,16,5.1.69,KING HENRY VI,"O, let me view his visage, being dead,"
9218,Henry VI Part 2,16,5.1.70,KING HENRY VI,That living wrought me such exceeding trouble.
9219,Henry VI Part 2,16,5.1.71,KING HENRY VI,"Tell me, my friend, art thou the man that slew him?"
9220,Henry VI Part 2,17,5.1.72,IDEN,"I was, an't like your majesty."
9221,Henry VI Part 2,18,5.1.73,KING HENRY VI,How art thou call'd? and what is thy degree?
9222,Henry VI Part 2,19,5.1.74,IDEN,"Alexander Iden, that's my name,"
9223,Henry VI Part 2,19,5.1.75,IDEN,"A poor esquire of Kent, that loves his king."
9224,Henry VI Part 2,20,5.1.76,BUCKINGHAM,"So please it you, my lord, 'twere not amiss"
9225,Henry VI Part 2,20,5.1.77,BUCKINGHAM,He were created knight for his good service.
9226,Henry VI Part 2,21,5.1.78,KING HENRY VI,"Iden, kneel down."
9227,Henry VI Part 2,21,,KING HENRY VI,He kneels
9228,Henry VI Part 2,21,5.1.79,KING HENRY VI,Rise up a knight.
9229,Henry VI Part 2,21,5.1.80,KING HENRY VI,"We give thee for reward a thousand marks,"
9230,Henry VI Part 2,21,5.1.81,KING HENRY VI,And will that thou henceforth attend on us.
9231,Henry VI Part 2,22,5.1.82,IDEN,May Iden live to merit such a bounty.
9232,Henry VI Part 2,22,5.1.83,IDEN,And never live but true unto his liege!
9233,Henry VI Part 2,22,,IDEN,Rises
9234,Henry VI Part 2,22,,IDEN,Enter QUEEN MARGARET and SOMERSET
9235,Henry VI Part 2,23,5.1.84,KING HENRY VI,"See, Buckingham, Somerset comes with the queen:"
9236,Henry VI Part 2,23,5.1.85,KING HENRY VI,"Go, bid her hide him quickly from the duke."
9237,Henry VI Part 2,24,5.1.86,QUEEN MARGARET,"For thousand Yorks he shall not hide his head,"
9238,Henry VI Part 2,24,5.1.87,QUEEN MARGARET,But boldly stand and front him to his face.
9239,Henry VI Part 2,25,5.1.88,YORK,How now! is Somerset at liberty?
9240,Henry VI Part 2,25,5.1.89,YORK,"Then, York, unloose thy long-imprison'd thoughts,"
9241,Henry VI Part 2,25,5.1.90,YORK,And let thy tongue be equal with thy heart.
9242,Henry VI Part 2,25,5.1.91,YORK,Shall I endure the sight of Somerset?
9243,Henry VI Part 2,25,5.1.92,YORK,"False king! why hast thou broken faith with me,"
9244,Henry VI Part 2,25,5.1.93,YORK,Knowing how hardly I can brook abuse?
9245,Henry VI Part 2,25,5.1.94,YORK,"King did I call thee? no, thou art not king,"
9246,Henry VI Part 2,25,5.1.95,YORK,"Not fit to govern and rule multitudes,"
9247,Henry VI Part 2,25,5.1.96,YORK,"Which darest not, no, nor canst not rule a traitor."
9248,Henry VI Part 2,25,5.1.97,YORK,"That head of thine doth not become a crown,"
9249,Henry VI Part 2,25,5.1.98,YORK,"Thy hand is made to grasp a palmer's staff,"
9250,Henry VI Part 2,25,5.1.99,YORK,And not to grace an awful princely sceptre.
9251,Henry VI Part 2,25,5.1.100,YORK,"That gold must round engirt these brows of mine,"
9252,Henry VI Part 2,25,5.1.101,YORK,"Whose smile and frown, like to Achilles' spear,"
9253,Henry VI Part 2,25,5.1.102,YORK,Is able with the change to kill and cure.
9254,Henry VI Part 2,25,5.1.103,YORK,Here is a hand to hold a sceptre up
9255,Henry VI Part 2,25,5.1.104,YORK,And with the same to act controlling laws.
9256,Henry VI Part 2,25,5.1.105,YORK,"Give place: by heaven, thou shalt rule no more"
9257,Henry VI Part 2,25,5.1.106,YORK,O'er him whom heaven created for thy ruler.
9258,Henry VI Part 2,26,5.1.107,SOMERSET,"O monstrous traitor! I arrest thee, York,"
9259,Henry VI Part 2,26,5.1.108,SOMERSET,"Of capital treason 'gainst the king and crown,"
9260,Henry VI Part 2,26,5.1.109,SOMERSET,"Obey, audacious traitor, kneel for grace."
9261,Henry VI Part 2,27,5.1.110,YORK,"Wouldst have me kneel? first let me ask of these,"
9262,Henry VI Part 2,27,5.1.111,YORK,If they can brook I bow a knee to man.
9263,Henry VI Part 2,27,5.1.112,YORK,"Sirrah, call in my sons to be my bail,"
9264,Henry VI Part 2,27,,YORK,Exit Attendant
9265,Henry VI Part 2,27,5.1.113,YORK,"I know, ere they will have me go to ward,"
9266,Henry VI Part 2,27,5.1.114,YORK,They'll pawn their swords for my enfranchisement.
9267,Henry VI Part 2,28,5.1.115,QUEEN MARGARET,"Call hither Clifford! bid him come amain,"
9268,Henry VI Part 2,28,5.1.116,QUEEN MARGARET,To say if that the bastard boys of York
9269,Henry VI Part 2,28,5.1.117,QUEEN MARGARET,Shall be the surety for their traitor father.
9270,Henry VI Part 2,28,,QUEEN MARGARET,Exit BUCKINGHAM
9271,Henry VI Part 2,29,5.1.118,YORK,"O blood-besotted Neapolitan,"
9272,Henry VI Part 2,29,5.1.119,YORK,"Outcast of Naples, England's bloody scourge!"
9273,Henry VI Part 2,29,5.1.120,YORK,"The sons of York, thy betters in their birth,"
9274,Henry VI Part 2,29,5.1.121,YORK,"Shall be their father's bail, and bane to those"
9275,Henry VI Part 2,29,5.1.122,YORK,That for my surety will refuse the boys!
9276,Henry VI Part 2,29,,YORK,Enter EDWARD and RICHARD
9277,Henry VI Part 2,29,5.1.123,YORK,See where they come: I'll warrant they'll
9278,Henry VI Part 2,29,5.1.124,YORK,make it good.
9279,Henry VI Part 2,29,,YORK,Enter CLIFFORD and YOUNG CLIFFORD
9280,Henry VI Part 2,30,5.1.125,QUEEN MARGARET,And here comes Clifford to deny their bail.
9281,Henry VI Part 2,31,5.1.126,CLIFFORD,Health and all happiness to my lord the king!
9282,Henry VI Part 2,31,,CLIFFORD,Kneels
9283,Henry VI Part 2,32,5.1.127,YORK,"I thank thee, Clifford: say, what news with thee?"
9284,Henry VI Part 2,32,5.1.128,YORK,"Nay, do not fright us with an angry look,"
9285,Henry VI Part 2,32,5.1.129,YORK,"We are thy sovereign, Clifford, kneel again,"
9286,Henry VI Part 2,32,5.1.130,YORK,"For thy mistaking so, we pardon thee."
9287,Henry VI Part 2,33,5.1.131,CLIFFORD,"This is my king, York, I do not mistake,"
9288,Henry VI Part 2,33,5.1.132,CLIFFORD,But thou mistakest me much to think I do:
9289,Henry VI Part 2,33,5.1.133,CLIFFORD,To Bedlam with him! is the man grown mad?
9290,Henry VI Part 2,34,5.1.134,KING HENRY VI,"Ay, Clifford, a bedlam and ambitious humour"
9291,Henry VI Part 2,34,5.1.135,KING HENRY VI,Makes him oppose himself against his king.
9292,Henry VI Part 2,35,5.1.136,CLIFFORD,"He is a traitor, let him to the Tower,"
9293,Henry VI Part 2,35,5.1.137,CLIFFORD,And chop away that factious pate of his.
9294,Henry VI Part 2,36,5.1.138,QUEEN MARGARET,"He is arrested, but will not obey,"
9295,Henry VI Part 2,36,5.1.139,QUEEN MARGARET,"His sons, he says, shall give their words for him."
9296,Henry VI Part 2,37,5.1.140,YORK,"Will you not, sons?"
9297,Henry VI Part 2,38,5.1.141,EDWARD,"Ay, noble father, if our words will serve."
9298,Henry VI Part 2,39,5.1.142,RICHARD,"And if words will not, then our weapons shall."
9299,Henry VI Part 2,40,5.1.143,CLIFFORD,"Why, what a brood of traitors have we here!"
9300,Henry VI Part 2,41,5.1.144,YORK,"Look in a glass, and call thy image so:"
9301,Henry VI Part 2,41,5.1.145,YORK,"I am thy king, and thou a false-heart traitor."
9302,Henry VI Part 2,41,5.1.146,YORK,"Call hither to the stake my two brave bears,"
9303,Henry VI Part 2,41,5.1.147,YORK,That with the very shaking of their chains
9304,Henry VI Part 2,41,5.1.148,YORK,They may astonish these fell-lurking curs:
9305,Henry VI Part 2,41,5.1.149,YORK,Bid Salisbury and Warwick come to me.
9306,Henry VI Part 2,41,,YORK,Enter the WARWICK and SALISBURY
9307,Henry VI Part 2,42,5.1.150,CLIFFORD,Are these thy bears? we'll bait thy bears to death.
9308,Henry VI Part 2,42,5.1.151,CLIFFORD,"And manacle the bear-ward in their chains,"
9309,Henry VI Part 2,42,5.1.152,CLIFFORD,If thou darest bring them to the baiting place.
9310,Henry VI Part 2,43,5.1.153,RICHARD,Oft have I seen a hot o'erweening cur
9311,Henry VI Part 2,43,5.1.154,RICHARD,"Run back and bite, because he was withheld,"
9312,Henry VI Part 2,43,5.1.155,RICHARD,"Who, being suffer'd with the bear's fell paw,"
9313,Henry VI Part 2,43,5.1.156,RICHARD,Hath clapp'd his tail between his legs and cried:
9314,Henry VI Part 2,43,5.1.157,RICHARD,"And such a piece of service will you do,"
9315,Henry VI Part 2,43,5.1.158,RICHARD,If you oppose yourselves to match Lord Warwick.
9316,Henry VI Part 2,44,5.1.159,CLIFFORD,"Hence, heap of wrath, foul indigested lump,"
9317,Henry VI Part 2,44,5.1.160,CLIFFORD,As crooked in thy manners as thy shape!
9318,Henry VI Part 2,45,5.1.161,YORK,"Nay, we shall heat you thoroughly anon."
9319,Henry VI Part 2,46,5.1.162,CLIFFORD,"Take heed, lest by your heat you burn yourselves."
9320,Henry VI Part 2,47,5.1.163,KING HENRY VI,"Why, Warwick, hath thy knee forgot to bow?"
9321,Henry VI Part 2,47,5.1.164,KING HENRY VI,"Old Salisbury, shame to thy silver hair,"
9322,Henry VI Part 2,47,5.1.165,KING HENRY VI,Thou mad misleader of thy brain-sick son!
9323,Henry VI Part 2,47,5.1.166,KING HENRY VI,"What, wilt thou on thy death-bed play the ruffian,"
9324,Henry VI Part 2,47,5.1.167,KING HENRY VI,And seek for sorrow with thy spectacles?
9325,Henry VI Part 2,47,5.1.168,KING HENRY VI,"O, where is faith? O, where is loyalty?"
9326,Henry VI Part 2,47,5.1.169,KING HENRY VI,"If it be banish'd from the frosty head,"
9327,Henry VI Part 2,47,5.1.170,KING HENRY VI,Where shall it find a harbour in the earth?
9328,Henry VI Part 2,47,5.1.171,KING HENRY VI,"Wilt thou go dig a grave to find out war,"
9329,Henry VI Part 2,47,5.1.172,KING HENRY VI,And shame thine honourable age with blood?
9330,Henry VI Part 2,47,5.1.173,KING HENRY VI,"Why art thou old, and want'st experience?"
9331,Henry VI Part 2,47,5.1.174,KING HENRY VI,"Or wherefore dost abuse it, if thou hast it?"
9332,Henry VI Part 2,47,5.1.175,KING HENRY VI,For shame! in duty bend thy knee to me
9333,Henry VI Part 2,47,5.1.176,KING HENRY VI,That bows unto the grave with mickle age.
9334,Henry VI Part 2,48,5.1.177,SALISBURY,"My lord, I have consider'd with myself"
9335,Henry VI Part 2,48,5.1.178,SALISBURY,"The title of this most renowned duke,"
9336,Henry VI Part 2,48,5.1.179,SALISBURY,And in my conscience do repute his grace
9337,Henry VI Part 2,48,5.1.180,SALISBURY,The rightful heir to England's royal seat.
9338,Henry VI Part 2,49,5.1.181,KING HENRY VI,Hast thou not sworn allegiance unto me?
9339,Henry VI Part 2,50,5.1.182,SALISBURY,I have.
9340,Henry VI Part 2,51,5.1.183,KING HENRY VI,Canst thou dispense with heaven for such an oath?
9341,Henry VI Part 2,52,5.1.184,SALISBURY,"It is great sin to swear unto a sin,"
9342,Henry VI Part 2,52,5.1.185,SALISBURY,But greater sin to keep a sinful oath.
9343,Henry VI Part 2,52,5.1.186,SALISBURY,Who can be bound by any solemn vow
9344,Henry VI Part 2,52,5.1.187,SALISBURY,"To do a murderous deed, to rob a man,"
9345,Henry VI Part 2,52,5.1.188,SALISBURY,"To force a spotless virgin's chastity,"
9346,Henry VI Part 2,52,5.1.189,SALISBURY,"To reave the orphan of his patrimony,"
9347,Henry VI Part 2,52,5.1.190,SALISBURY,"To wring the widow from her custom'd right,"
9348,Henry VI Part 2,52,5.1.191,SALISBURY,And have no other reason for this wrong
9349,Henry VI Part 2,52,5.1.192,SALISBURY,But that he was bound by a solemn oath?
9350,Henry VI Part 2,53,5.1.193,QUEEN MARGARET,A subtle traitor needs no sophister.
9351,Henry VI Part 2,54,5.1.194,KING HENRY VI,"Call Buckingham, and bid him arm himself."
9352,Henry VI Part 2,55,5.1.195,YORK,"Call Buckingham, and all the friends thou hast,"
9353,Henry VI Part 2,55,5.1.196,YORK,I am resolved for death or dignity.
9354,Henry VI Part 2,56,5.1.197,CLIFFORD,"The first I warrant thee, if dreams prove true."
9355,Henry VI Part 2,57,5.1.198,WARWICK,"You were best to go to bed and dream again,"
9356,Henry VI Part 2,57,5.1.199,WARWICK,To keep thee from the tempest of the field.
9357,Henry VI Part 2,58,5.1.200,CLIFFORD,I am resolved to bear a greater storm
9358,Henry VI Part 2,58,5.1.201,CLIFFORD,"Than any thou canst conjure up to-day,"
9359,Henry VI Part 2,58,5.1.202,CLIFFORD,"And that I'll write upon thy burgonet,"
9360,Henry VI Part 2,58,5.1.203,CLIFFORD,Might I but know thee by thy household badge.
9361,Henry VI Part 2,59,5.1.204,WARWICK,"Now, by my father's badge, old Nevil's crest,"
9362,Henry VI Part 2,59,5.1.205,WARWICK,"The rampant bear chain'd to the ragged staff,"
9363,Henry VI Part 2,59,5.1.206,WARWICK,"This day I'll wear aloft my burgonet,"
9364,Henry VI Part 2,59,5.1.207,WARWICK,As on a mountain top the cedar shows
9365,Henry VI Part 2,59,5.1.208,WARWICK,"That keeps his leaves in spite of any storm,"
9366,Henry VI Part 2,59,5.1.209,WARWICK,Even to affright thee with the view thereof.
9367,Henry VI Part 2,60,5.1.210,CLIFFORD,And from thy burgonet I'll rend thy bear
9368,Henry VI Part 2,60,5.1.211,CLIFFORD,"And tread it under foot with all contempt,"
9369,Henry VI Part 2,60,5.1.212,CLIFFORD,Despite the bear-ward that protects the bear.
9370,Henry VI Part 2,61,5.1.213,YOUNG CLIFFORD,"And so to arms, victorious father,"
9371,Henry VI Part 2,61,5.1.214,YOUNG CLIFFORD,To quell the rebels and their complices.
9372,Henry VI Part 2,62,5.1.215,RICHARD,"Fie! charity, for shame! speak not in spite,"
9373,Henry VI Part 2,62,5.1.216,RICHARD,For you shall sup with Jesu Christ to-night.
9374,Henry VI Part 2,63,5.1.217,YOUNG CLIFFORD,"Foul stigmatic, that's more than thou canst tell."
9375,Henry VI Part 2,64,5.1.218,RICHARD,"If not in heaven, you'll surely sup in hell."
9376,Henry VI Part 2,64,,RICHARD,Exeunt severally
9377,Henry VI Part 2,64,,RICHARD,SCENE II. Saint Alban's.
9378,Henry VI Part 2,64,,RICHARD,Alarums to the battle. Enter WARWICK
9379,Henry VI Part 2,1,5.2.1,WARWICK,"Clifford of Cumberland, 'tis Warwick calls:"
9380,Henry VI Part 2,1,5.2.2,WARWICK,"And if thou dost not hide thee from the bear,"
9381,Henry VI Part 2,1,5.2.3,WARWICK,"Now, when the angry trumpet sounds alarum"
9382,Henry VI Part 2,1,5.2.4,WARWICK,"And dead men's cries do fill the empty air,"
9383,Henry VI Part 2,1,5.2.5,WARWICK,"Clifford, I say, come forth and fight with me:"
9384,Henry VI Part 2,1,5.2.6,WARWICK,"Proud northern lord, Clifford of Cumberland,"
9385,Henry VI Part 2,1,5.2.7,WARWICK,Warwick is hoarse with calling thee to arms.
9386,Henry VI Part 2,1,,WARWICK,Enter YORK
9387,Henry VI Part 2,1,5.2.8,WARWICK,"How now, my noble lord? what, all afoot?"
9388,Henry VI Part 2,2,5.2.9,YORK,"The deadly-handed Clifford slew my steed,"
9389,Henry VI Part 2,2,5.2.10,YORK,But match to match I have encounter'd him
9390,Henry VI Part 2,2,5.2.11,YORK,And made a prey for carrion kites and crows
9391,Henry VI Part 2,2,5.2.12,YORK,Even of the bonny beast he loved so well.
9392,Henry VI Part 2,2,,YORK,Enter CLIFFORD
9393,Henry VI Part 2,3,5.2.13,WARWICK,Of one or both of us the time is come.
9394,Henry VI Part 2,4,5.2.14,YORK,"Hold, Warwick, seek thee out some other chase,"
9395,Henry VI Part 2,4,5.2.15,YORK,For I myself must hunt this deer to death.
9396,Henry VI Part 2,5,5.2.16,WARWICK,"Then, nobly, York, 'tis for a crown thou fight'st."
9397,Henry VI Part 2,5,5.2.17,WARWICK,"As I intend, Clifford, to thrive to-day,"
9398,Henry VI Part 2,5,5.2.18,WARWICK,It grieves my soul to leave thee unassail'd.
9399,Henry VI Part 2,5,,WARWICK,Exit
9400,Henry VI Part 2,6,5.2.19,CLIFFORD,"What seest thou in me, York? why dost thou pause?"
9401,Henry VI Part 2,7,5.2.20,YORK,"With thy brave bearing should I be in love,"
9402,Henry VI Part 2,7,5.2.21,YORK,But that thou art so fast mine enemy.
9403,Henry VI Part 2,8,5.2.22,CLIFFORD,"Nor should thy prowess want praise and esteem,"
9404,Henry VI Part 2,8,5.2.23,CLIFFORD,But that 'tis shown ignobly and in treason.
9405,Henry VI Part 2,9,5.2.24,YORK,So let it help me now against thy sword
9406,Henry VI Part 2,9,5.2.25,YORK,As I in justice and true right express it.
9407,Henry VI Part 2,10,5.2.26,CLIFFORD,My soul and body on the action both!
9408,Henry VI Part 2,11,5.2.27,YORK,A dreadful lay! Address thee instantly.
9409,Henry VI Part 2,11,,YORK,"They fight, and CLIFFORD falls"
9410,Henry VI Part 2,12,5.2.28,CLIFFORD,La fin couronne les oeuvres.
9411,Henry VI Part 2,12,,CLIFFORD,Dies
9412,Henry VI Part 2,13,5.2.29,YORK,"Thus war hath given thee peace, for thou art still."
9413,Henry VI Part 2,13,5.2.30,YORK,"Peace with his soul, heaven, if it be thy will!"
9414,Henry VI Part 2,13,,YORK,Exit
9415,Henry VI Part 2,13,,YORK,Enter YOUNG CLIFFORD
9416,Henry VI Part 2,14,5.2.31,YOUNG CLIFFORD,"Shame and confusion! all is on the rout,"
9417,Henry VI Part 2,14,5.2.32,YOUNG CLIFFORD,"Fear frames disorder, and disorder wounds"
9418,Henry VI Part 2,14,5.2.33,YOUNG CLIFFORD,"Where it should guard. O war, thou son of hell,"
9419,Henry VI Part 2,14,5.2.34,YOUNG CLIFFORD,Whom angry heavens do make their minister
9420,Henry VI Part 2,14,5.2.35,YOUNG CLIFFORD,Throw in the frozen bosoms of our part
9421,Henry VI Part 2,14,5.2.36,YOUNG CLIFFORD,Hot coals of vengeance! Let no soldier fly.
9422,Henry VI Part 2,14,5.2.37,YOUNG CLIFFORD,He that is truly dedicate to war
9423,Henry VI Part 2,14,5.2.38,YOUNG CLIFFORD,"Hath no self-love, nor he that loves himself"
9424,Henry VI Part 2,14,5.2.39,YOUNG CLIFFORD,Hath not essentially but by circumstance
9425,Henry VI Part 2,14,5.2.40,YOUNG CLIFFORD,The name of valour.
9426,Henry VI Part 2,14,,YOUNG CLIFFORD,Seeing his dead father
9427,Henry VI Part 2,14,5.2.41,YOUNG CLIFFORD,"O, let the vile world end,"
9428,Henry VI Part 2,14,5.2.42,YOUNG CLIFFORD,And the premised flames of the last day
9429,Henry VI Part 2,14,5.2.43,YOUNG CLIFFORD,Knit earth and heaven together!
9430,Henry VI Part 2,14,5.2.44,YOUNG CLIFFORD,"Now let the general trumpet blow his blast,"
9431,Henry VI Part 2,14,5.2.45,YOUNG CLIFFORD,Particularities and petty sounds
9432,Henry VI Part 2,14,5.2.46,YOUNG CLIFFORD,"To cease! Wast thou ordain'd, dear father,"
9433,Henry VI Part 2,14,5.2.47,YOUNG CLIFFORD,"To lose thy youth in peace, and to achieve"
9434,Henry VI Part 2,14,5.2.48,YOUNG CLIFFORD,"The silver livery of advised age,"
9435,Henry VI Part 2,14,5.2.49,YOUNG CLIFFORD,"And, in thy reverence and thy chair-days, thus"
9436,Henry VI Part 2,14,5.2.50,YOUNG CLIFFORD,To die in ruffian battle? Even at this sight
9437,Henry VI Part 2,14,5.2.51,YOUNG CLIFFORD,"My heart is turn'd to stone: and while 'tis mine,"
9438,Henry VI Part 2,14,5.2.52,YOUNG CLIFFORD,"It shall be stony. York not our old men spares,"
9439,Henry VI Part 2,14,5.2.53,YOUNG CLIFFORD,No more will I their babes: tears virginal
9440,Henry VI Part 2,14,5.2.54,YOUNG CLIFFORD,"Shall be to me even as the dew to fire,"
9441,Henry VI Part 2,14,5.2.55,YOUNG CLIFFORD,And beauty that the tyrant oft reclaims
9442,Henry VI Part 2,14,5.2.56,YOUNG CLIFFORD,Shall to my flaming wrath be oil and flax.
9443,Henry VI Part 2,14,5.2.57,YOUNG CLIFFORD,Henceforth I will not have to do with pity:
9444,Henry VI Part 2,14,5.2.58,YOUNG CLIFFORD,"Meet I an infant of the house of York,"
9445,Henry VI Part 2,14,5.2.59,YOUNG CLIFFORD,Into as many gobbets will I cut it
9446,Henry VI Part 2,14,5.2.60,YOUNG CLIFFORD,As wild Medea young Absyrtus did:
9447,Henry VI Part 2,14,5.2.61,YOUNG CLIFFORD,In cruelty will I seek out my fame.
9448,Henry VI Part 2,14,5.2.62,YOUNG CLIFFORD,"Come, thou new ruin of old Clifford's house:"
9449,Henry VI Part 2,14,5.2.63,YOUNG CLIFFORD,"As did AEneas old Anchises bear,"
9450,Henry VI Part 2,14,5.2.64,YOUNG CLIFFORD,"So bear I thee upon my manly shoulders,"
9451,Henry VI Part 2,14,5.2.65,YOUNG CLIFFORD,"But then AEneas bare a living load,"
9452,Henry VI Part 2,14,5.2.66,YOUNG CLIFFORD,Nothing so heavy as these woes of mine.
9453,Henry VI Part 2,14,,YOUNG CLIFFORD,"Exit, bearing off his father"
9454,Henry VI Part 2,14,,YOUNG CLIFFORD,Enter RICHARD and SOMERSET to fight. SOMERSET is killed
9455,Henry VI Part 2,15,5.2.67,RICHARD,"So, lie thou there,"

9457,Henry VI Part 2,15,5.2.69,RICHARD,"The Castle in Saint Alban's, Somerset"
9458,Henry VI Part 2,15,5.2.70,RICHARD,Hath made the wizard famous in his death.
9459,Henry VI Part 2,15,5.2.71,RICHARD,"Sword, hold thy temper, heart, be wrathful still:"
9460,Henry VI Part 2,15,5.2.72,RICHARD,"Priests pray for enemies, but princes kill."
9461,Henry VI Part 2,15,,RICHARD,Exit
9462,Henry VI Part 2,15,,RICHARD,"Fight: excursions. Enter KING HENRY VI, QUEEN MARGARET, and others"
9463,Henry VI Part 2,16,5.2.73,QUEEN MARGARET,"Away, my lord! you are slow, for shame, away!"
9464,Henry VI Part 2,17,5.2.74,KING HENRY VI,"Can we outrun the heavens? good Margaret, stay."
9465,Henry VI Part 2,18,5.2.75,QUEEN MARGARET,What are you made of? you'll nor fight nor fly:
9466,Henry VI Part 2,18,5.2.76,QUEEN MARGARET,"Now is it manhood, wisdom and defence,"
9467,Henry VI Part 2,18,5.2.77,QUEEN MARGARET,"To give the enemy way, and to secure us"
9468,Henry VI Part 2,18,5.2.78,QUEEN MARGARET,"By what we can, which can no more but fly."
9469,Henry VI Part 2,18,,QUEEN MARGARET,Alarum afar off
9470,Henry VI Part 2,18,5.2.79,QUEEN MARGARET,"If you be ta'en, we then should see the bottom"
9471,Henry VI Part 2,18,5.2.80,QUEEN MARGARET,"Of all our fortunes: but if we haply scape,"
9472,Henry VI Part 2,18,5.2.81,QUEEN MARGARET,"As well we may, if not through your neglect,"
9473,Henry VI Part 2,18,5.2.82,QUEEN MARGARET,"We shall to London get, where you are loved"
9474,Henry VI Part 2,18,5.2.83,QUEEN MARGARET,And where this breach now in our fortunes made
9475,Henry VI Part 2,18,5.2.84,QUEEN MARGARET,May readily be stopp'd.
9476,Henry VI Part 2,18,,QUEEN MARGARET,Re-enter YOUNG CLIFFORD
9477,Henry VI Part 2,19,5.2.85,YOUNG CLIFFORD,"But that my heart's on future mischief set,"
9478,Henry VI Part 2,19,5.2.86,YOUNG CLIFFORD,I would speak blasphemy ere bid you fly:
9479,Henry VI Part 2,19,5.2.87,YOUNG CLIFFORD,"But fly you must, uncurable discomfit"
9480,Henry VI Part 2,19,5.2.88,YOUNG CLIFFORD,Reigns in the hearts of all our present parts.
9481,Henry VI Part 2,19,5.2.89,YOUNG CLIFFORD,"Away, for your relief! and we will live"
9482,Henry VI Part 2,19,5.2.90,YOUNG CLIFFORD,To see their day and them our fortune give:
9483,Henry VI Part 2,19,5.2.91,YOUNG CLIFFORD,"Away, my lord, away!"
9484,Henry VI Part 2,19,,YOUNG CLIFFORD,Exeunt
9485,Henry VI Part 2,19,,YOUNG CLIFFORD,SCENE III. Fields near St. Alban's.
9486,Henry VI Part 2,19,,YOUNG CLIFFORD,"Alarum. Retreat. Enter YORK, RICHARD, WARWICK, and Soldiers, with drum and colours"
9487,Henry VI Part 2,1,5.3.1,YORK,"Of Salisbury, who can report of him,"
9488,Henry VI Part 2,1,5.3.2,YORK,"That winter lion, who in rage forgets"
9489,Henry VI Part 2,1,5.3.3,YORK,"Aged contusions and all brush of time,"
9490,Henry VI Part 2,1,5.3.4,YORK,"And, like a gallant in the brow of youth,"
9491,Henry VI Part 2,1,5.3.5,YORK,Repairs him with occasion? This happy day
9492,Henry VI Part 2,1,5.3.6,YORK,"Is not itself, nor have we won one foot,"
9493,Henry VI Part 2,1,5.3.7,YORK,If Salisbury be lost.
9494,Henry VI Part 2,2,5.3.8,RICHARD,"My noble father,"
9495,Henry VI Part 2,2,5.3.9,RICHARD,"Three times to-day I holp him to his horse,"
9496,Henry VI Part 2,2,5.3.10,RICHARD,"Three times bestrid him, thrice I led him off,"
9497,Henry VI Part 2,2,5.3.11,RICHARD,Persuaded him from any further act:
9498,Henry VI Part 2,2,5.3.12,RICHARD,"But still, where danger was, still there I met him,"
9499,Henry VI Part 2,2,5.3.13,RICHARD,"And like rich hangings in a homely house,"
9500,Henry VI Part 2,2,5.3.14,RICHARD,So was his will in his old feeble body.
9501,Henry VI Part 2,2,5.3.15,RICHARD,"But, noble as he is, look where he comes."
9502,Henry VI Part 2,2,,RICHARD,Enter SALISBURY
9503,Henry VI Part 2,3,5.3.16,SALISBURY,"Now, by my sword, well hast thou fought to-day,"
9504,Henry VI Part 2,3,5.3.17,SALISBURY,"By the mass, so did we all. I thank you, Richard:"
9505,Henry VI Part 2,3,5.3.18,SALISBURY,"God knows how long it is I have to live,"
9506,Henry VI Part 2,3,5.3.19,SALISBURY,And it hath pleased him that three times to-day
9507,Henry VI Part 2,3,5.3.20,SALISBURY,You have defended me from imminent death.
9508,Henry VI Part 2,3,5.3.21,SALISBURY,"Well, lords, we have not got that which we have:"
9509,Henry VI Part 2,3,5.3.22,SALISBURY,"'Tis not enough our foes are this time fled,"
9510,Henry VI Part 2,3,5.3.23,SALISBURY,Being opposites of such repairing nature.
9511,Henry VI Part 2,4,5.3.24,YORK,"I know our safety is to follow them,"
9512,Henry VI Part 2,4,5.3.25,YORK,"For, as I hear, the king is fled to London,"
9513,Henry VI Part 2,4,5.3.26,YORK,To call a present court of parliament.
9514,Henry VI Part 2,4,5.3.27,YORK,Let us pursue him ere the writs go forth.
9515,Henry VI Part 2,4,5.3.28,YORK,What says Lord Warwick? shall we after them?
9516,Henry VI Part 2,5,5.3.29,WARWICK,"After them! nay, before them, if we can."
9517,Henry VI Part 2,5,5.3.30,WARWICK,"Now, by my faith, lords, 'twas a glorious day:"
9518,Henry VI Part 2,5,5.3.31,WARWICK,Saint Alban's battle won by famous York
9519,Henry VI Part 2,5,5.3.32,WARWICK,Shall be eternized in all age to come.
9520,Henry VI Part 2,5,5.3.33,WARWICK,"Sound drums and trumpets, and to London all:"
9521,Henry VI Part 2,5,5.3.34,WARWICK,And more such days as these to us befall!
9522,Henry VI Part 2,5,,WARWICK,Exeunt
9523,Henry VI Part 3,5,,WARWICK,ACT I
9524,Henry VI Part 3,5,,WARWICK,SCENE I. London. The Parliament-house.
9525,Henry VI Part 3,5,,WARWICK,"Alarum. Enter YORK, EDWARD, RICHARD, NORFOLK, MONTAGUE, WARWICK, and Soldiers"
9526,Henry VI Part 3,1,1.1.1,WARWICK,I wonder how the king escaped our hands.
9527,Henry VI Part 3,2,1.1.2,YORK,"While we pursued the horsemen of the north,"
9528,Henry VI Part 3,2,1.1.3,YORK,He slily stole away and left his men:
9529,Henry VI Part 3,2,1.1.4,YORK,"Whereat the great Lord of Northumberland,"
9530,Henry VI Part 3,2,1.1.5,YORK,"Whose warlike ears could never brook retreat,"
9531,Henry VI Part 3,2,1.1.6,YORK,"Cheer'd up the drooping army, and himself,"
9532,Henry VI Part 3,2,1.1.7,YORK,"Lord Clifford and Lord Stafford, all abreast,"
9533,Henry VI Part 3,2,1.1.8,YORK,"Charged our main battle's front, and breaking in"
9534,Henry VI Part 3,2,1.1.9,YORK,Were by the swords of common soldiers slain.
9535,Henry VI Part 3,3,1.1.10,EDWARD,"Lord Stafford's father, Duke of Buckingham,"
9536,Henry VI Part 3,3,1.1.11,EDWARD,"Is either slain or wounded dangerously,"
9537,Henry VI Part 3,3,1.1.12,EDWARD,I cleft his beaver with a downright blow:
9538,Henry VI Part 3,3,1.1.13,EDWARD,"That this is true, father, behold his blood."
9539,Henry VI Part 3,4,1.1.14,MONTAGUE,"And, brother, here's the Earl of Wiltshire's blood,"
9540,Henry VI Part 3,4,1.1.15,MONTAGUE,Whom I encounter'd as the battles join'd.
9541,Henry VI Part 3,5,1.1.16,RICHARD,Speak thou for me and tell them what I did.
9542,Henry VI Part 3,5,,RICHARD,Throwing down SOMERSET's head
9543,Henry VI Part 3,6,1.1.17,YORK,Richard hath best deserved of all my sons.
9544,Henry VI Part 3,6,1.1.18,YORK,"But is your grace dead, my Lord of Somerset?"
9545,Henry VI Part 3,7,1.1.19,NORFOLK,Such hope have all the line of John of Gaunt!
9546,Henry VI Part 3,8,1.1.20,RICHARD,Thus do I hope to shake King Henry's head.
9547,Henry VI Part 3,9,1.1.21,WARWICK,"And so do I. Victorious Prince of York,"
9548,Henry VI Part 3,9,1.1.22,WARWICK,Before I see thee seated in that throne
9549,Henry VI Part 3,9,1.1.23,WARWICK,"Which now the house of Lancaster usurps,"
9550,Henry VI Part 3,9,1.1.24,WARWICK,I vow by heaven these eyes shall never close.
9551,Henry VI Part 3,9,1.1.25,WARWICK,"This is the palace of the fearful king,"
9552,Henry VI Part 3,9,1.1.26,WARWICK,"And this the regal seat: possess it, York,"
9553,Henry VI Part 3,9,1.1.27,WARWICK,For this is thine and not King Henry's heirs'
9554,Henry VI Part 3,10,1.1.28,YORK,"Assist me, then, sweet Warwick, and I will,"
9555,Henry VI Part 3,10,1.1.29,YORK,For hither we have broken in by force.
9556,Henry VI Part 3,11,1.1.30,NORFOLK,"We'll all assist you, he that flies shall die."
9557,Henry VI Part 3,12,1.1.31,YORK,"Thanks, gentle Norfolk: stay by me, my lords,"
9558,Henry VI Part 3,12,1.1.32,YORK,"And, soldiers, stay and lodge by me this night."
9559,Henry VI Part 3,12,,YORK,They go up
9560,Henry VI Part 3,13,1.1.33,WARWICK,"And when the king comes, offer no violence,"
9561,Henry VI Part 3,13,1.1.34,WARWICK,Unless he seek to thrust you out perforce.
9562,Henry VI Part 3,14,1.1.35,YORK,"The queen this day here holds her parliament,"
9563,Henry VI Part 3,14,1.1.36,YORK,But little thinks we shall be of her council:
9564,Henry VI Part 3,14,1.1.37,YORK,By words or blows here let us win our right.
9565,Henry VI Part 3,15,1.1.38,RICHARD,"Arm'd as we are, let's stay within this house."
9566,Henry VI Part 3,16,1.1.39,WARWICK,"The bloody parliament shall this be call'd,"
9567,Henry VI Part 3,16,1.1.40,WARWICK,"Unless Plantagenet, Duke of York, be king,"
9568,Henry VI Part 3,16,1.1.41,WARWICK,"And bashful Henry deposed, whose cowardice"
9569,Henry VI Part 3,16,1.1.42,WARWICK,Hath made us by-words to our enemies.
9570,Henry VI Part 3,17,1.1.43,YORK,"Then leave me not, my lords, be resolute,"
9571,Henry VI Part 3,17,1.1.44,YORK,I mean to take possession of my right.
9572,Henry VI Part 3,18,1.1.45,WARWICK,"Neither the king, nor he that loves him best,"
9573,Henry VI Part 3,18,1.1.46,WARWICK,"The proudest he that holds up Lancaster,"
9574,Henry VI Part 3,18,1.1.47,WARWICK,"Dares stir a wing, if Warwick shake his bells."
9575,Henry VI Part 3,18,1.1.48,WARWICK,"I'll plant Plantagenet, root him up who dares:"
9576,Henry VI Part 3,18,1.1.49,WARWICK,"Resolve thee, Richard, claim the English crown."
9577,Henry VI Part 3,18,,WARWICK,"Flourish. Enter KING HENRY VI, CLIFFORD, NORTHUMBERLAND, WESTMORELAND, EXETER, and the rest"
9578,Henry VI Part 3,19,1.1.50,KING HENRY VI,"My lords, look where the sturdy rebel sits,"
9579,Henry VI Part 3,19,1.1.51,KING HENRY VI,"Even in the chair of state: belike he means,"
9580,Henry VI Part 3,19,1.1.52,KING HENRY VI,"Back'd by the power of Warwick, that false peer,"
9581,Henry VI Part 3,19,1.1.53,KING HENRY VI,To aspire unto the crown and reign as king.
9582,Henry VI Part 3,19,1.1.54,KING HENRY VI,"Earl of Northumberland, he slew thy father."
9583,Henry VI Part 3,19,1.1.55,KING HENRY VI,"And thine, Lord Clifford, and you both have vow'd revenge"
9584,Henry VI Part 3,19,1.1.56,KING HENRY VI,"On him, his sons, his favourites and his friends."
9585,Henry VI Part 3,20,1.1.57,NORTHUMBERLAND,"If I be not, heavens be revenged on me!"
9586,Henry VI Part 3,21,1.1.58,CLIFFORD,The hope thereof makes Clifford mourn in steel.
9587,Henry VI Part 3,22,1.1.59,WESTMORELAND,"What, shall we suffer this? let's pluck him down:"
9588,Henry VI Part 3,22,1.1.60,WESTMORELAND,"My heart for anger burns, I cannot brook it."
9589,Henry VI Part 3,23,1.1.61,KING HENRY VI,"Be patient, gentle Earl of Westmoreland."
9590,Henry VI Part 3,24,1.1.62,CLIFFORD,"Patience is for poltroons, such as he:"
9591,Henry VI Part 3,24,1.1.63,CLIFFORD,"He durst not sit there, had your father lived."
9592,Henry VI Part 3,24,1.1.64,CLIFFORD,"My gracious lord, here in the parliament"
9593,Henry VI Part 3,24,1.1.65,CLIFFORD,Let us assail the family of York.
9594,Henry VI Part 3,25,1.1.66,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Well hast thou spoken, cousin: be it so."
9595,Henry VI Part 3,26,1.1.67,KING HENRY VI,"Ah, know you not the city favours them,"
9596,Henry VI Part 3,26,1.1.68,KING HENRY VI,And they have troops of soldiers at their beck?
9597,Henry VI Part 3,27,1.1.69,EXETER,"But when the duke is slain, they'll quickly fly."
9598,Henry VI Part 3,28,1.1.70,KING HENRY VI,"Far be the thought of this from Henry's heart,"
9599,Henry VI Part 3,28,1.1.71,KING HENRY VI,To make a shambles of the parliament-house!
9600,Henry VI Part 3,28,1.1.72,KING HENRY VI,"Cousin of Exeter, frowns, words and threats"
9601,Henry VI Part 3,28,1.1.73,KING HENRY VI,Shall be the war that Henry means to use.
9602,Henry VI Part 3,28,1.1.74,KING HENRY VI,"Thou factious Duke of York, descend my throne,"
9603,Henry VI Part 3,28,1.1.75,KING HENRY VI,"and kneel for grace and mercy at my feet,"
9604,Henry VI Part 3,28,1.1.76,KING HENRY VI,I am thy sovereign.
9605,Henry VI Part 3,29,1.1.77,YORK,I am thine.
9606,Henry VI Part 3,30,1.1.78,EXETER,"For shame, come down: he made thee Duke of York."
9607,Henry VI Part 3,31,1.1.79,YORK,"'Twas my inheritance, as the earldom was."
9608,Henry VI Part 3,32,1.1.80,EXETER,Thy father was a traitor to the crown.
9609,Henry VI Part 3,33,1.1.81,WARWICK,"Exeter, thou art a traitor to the crown"
9610,Henry VI Part 3,33,1.1.82,WARWICK,In following this usurping Henry.
9611,Henry VI Part 3,34,1.1.83,CLIFFORD,Whom should he follow but his natural king?
9612,Henry VI Part 3,35,1.1.84,WARWICK,"True, Clifford, and that's Richard Duke of York."
9613,Henry VI Part 3,36,1.1.85,KING HENRY VI,"And shall I stand, and thou sit in my throne?"
9614,Henry VI Part 3,37,1.1.86,YORK,It must and shall be so: content thyself.
9615,Henry VI Part 3,38,1.1.87,WARWICK,"Be Duke of Lancaster, let him be king."
9616,Henry VI Part 3,39,1.1.88,WESTMORELAND,"He is both king and Duke of Lancaster,"
9617,Henry VI Part 3,39,1.1.89,WESTMORELAND,And that the Lord of Westmoreland shall maintain.
9618,Henry VI Part 3,40,1.1.90,WARWICK,And Warwick shall disprove it. You forget
9619,Henry VI Part 3,40,1.1.91,WARWICK,That we are those which chased you from the field
9620,Henry VI Part 3,40,1.1.92,WARWICK,"And slew your fathers, and with colours spread"
9621,Henry VI Part 3,40,1.1.93,WARWICK,March'd through the city to the palace gates.
9622,Henry VI Part 3,41,1.1.94,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Yes, Warwick, I remember it to my grief,"
9623,Henry VI Part 3,41,1.1.95,NORTHUMBERLAND,"And, by his soul, thou and thy house shall rue it."
9624,Henry VI Part 3,42,1.1.96,WESTMORELAND,"Plantagenet, of thee and these thy sons,"
9625,Henry VI Part 3,42,1.1.97,WESTMORELAND,"Thy kinsman and thy friends, I'll have more lives"
9626,Henry VI Part 3,42,1.1.98,WESTMORELAND,Than drops of blood were in my father's veins.
9627,Henry VI Part 3,43,1.1.99,CLIFFORD,"Urge it no more, lest that, instead of words,"
9628,Henry VI Part 3,43,1.1.100,CLIFFORD,"I send thee, Warwick, such a messenger"
9629,Henry VI Part 3,43,1.1.101,CLIFFORD,As shall revenge his death before I stir.
9630,Henry VI Part 3,44,1.1.102,WARWICK,Poor Clifford! how I scorn his worthless threats!
9631,Henry VI Part 3,45,1.1.103,YORK,Will you we show our title to the crown?
9632,Henry VI Part 3,45,1.1.104,YORK,"If not, our swords shall plead it in the field."
9633,Henry VI Part 3,46,1.1.105,KING HENRY VI,"What title hast thou, traitor, to the crown?"
9634,Henry VI Part 3,46,1.1.106,KING HENRY VI,"Thy father was, as thou art, Duke of York,"
9635,Henry VI Part 3,46,1.1.107,KING HENRY VI,"Thy grandfather, Roger Mortimer, Earl of March:"
9636,Henry VI Part 3,46,1.1.108,KING HENRY VI,"I am the son of Henry the Fifth,"
9637,Henry VI Part 3,46,1.1.109,KING HENRY VI,Who made the Dauphin and the French to stoop
9638,Henry VI Part 3,46,1.1.110,KING HENRY VI,And seized upon their towns and provinces.
9639,Henry VI Part 3,47,1.1.111,WARWICK,"Talk not of France, sith thou hast lost it all."
9640,Henry VI Part 3,48,1.1.112,KING HENRY VI,"The lord protector lost it, and not I:"
9641,Henry VI Part 3,48,1.1.113,KING HENRY VI,When I was crown'd I was but nine months old.
9642,Henry VI Part 3,49,1.1.114,RICHARD,"You are old enough now, and yet, methinks, you lose."
9643,Henry VI Part 3,49,1.1.115,RICHARD,"Father, tear the crown from the usurper's head."
9644,Henry VI Part 3,50,1.1.116,EDWARD,"Sweet father, do so, set it on your head."
9645,Henry VI Part 3,51,1.1.117,MONTAGUE,"Good brother, as thou lovest and honourest arms,"
9646,Henry VI Part 3,51,1.1.118,MONTAGUE,Let's fight it out and not stand cavilling thus.
9647,Henry VI Part 3,52,1.1.119,RICHARD,"Sound drums and trumpets, and the king will fly."
9648,Henry VI Part 3,53,1.1.120,YORK,"Sons, peace!"
9649,Henry VI Part 3,54,1.1.121,KING HENRY VI,"Peace, thou! and give King Henry leave to speak."
9650,Henry VI Part 3,55,1.1.122,WARWICK,"Plantagenet shall speak first: hear him, lords,"
9651,Henry VI Part 3,55,1.1.123,WARWICK,"And be you silent and attentive too,"
9652,Henry VI Part 3,55,1.1.124,WARWICK,For he that interrupts him shall not live.
9653,Henry VI Part 3,56,1.1.125,KING HENRY VI,"Think'st thou that I will leave my kingly throne,"
9654,Henry VI Part 3,56,1.1.126,KING HENRY VI,Wherein my grandsire and my father sat?
9655,Henry VI Part 3,56,1.1.127,KING HENRY VI,"No: first shall war unpeople this my realm,"
9656,Henry VI Part 3,56,1.1.128,KING HENRY VI,"Ay, and their colours, often borne in France,"
9657,Henry VI Part 3,56,1.1.129,KING HENRY VI,"And now in England to our heart's great sorrow,"
9658,Henry VI Part 3,56,1.1.130,KING HENRY VI,"Shall be my winding-sheet. Why faint you, lords?"
9659,Henry VI Part 3,56,1.1.131,KING HENRY VI,"My title's good, and better far than his."
9660,Henry VI Part 3,57,1.1.132,WARWICK,"Prove it, Henry, and thou shalt be king."
9661,Henry VI Part 3,58,1.1.133,KING HENRY VI,Henry the Fourth by conquest got the crown.
9662,Henry VI Part 3,59,1.1.134,YORK,'Twas by rebellion against his king.
9663,Henry VI Part 3,60,1.1.135,KING HENRY VI,"[Aside]  I know not what to say, my title's weak.--"
9664,Henry VI Part 3,60,1.1.136,KING HENRY VI,"Tell me, may not a king adopt an heir?"
9665,Henry VI Part 3,61,1.1.137,YORK,What then?
9666,Henry VI Part 3,62,1.1.138,KING HENRY VI,"An if he may, then am I lawful king,"
9667,Henry VI Part 3,62,1.1.139,KING HENRY VI,"For Richard, in the view of many lords,"
9668,Henry VI Part 3,62,1.1.140,KING HENRY VI,"Resign'd the crown to Henry the Fourth,"
9669,Henry VI Part 3,62,1.1.141,KING HENRY VI,"Whose heir my father was, and I am his."
9670,Henry VI Part 3,63,1.1.142,YORK,"He rose against him, being his sovereign,"
9671,Henry VI Part 3,63,1.1.143,YORK,And made him to resign his crown perforce.
9672,Henry VI Part 3,64,1.1.144,WARWICK,"Suppose, my lords, he did it unconstrain'd,"
9673,Henry VI Part 3,64,1.1.145,WARWICK,Think you 'twere prejudicial to his crown?
9674,Henry VI Part 3,65,1.1.146,EXETER,"No, for he could not so resign his crown"
9675,Henry VI Part 3,65,1.1.147,EXETER,But that the next heir should succeed and reign.
9676,Henry VI Part 3,66,1.1.148,KING HENRY VI,"Art thou against us, Duke of Exeter?"
9677,Henry VI Part 3,67,1.1.149,EXETER,"His is the right, and therefore pardon me."
9678,Henry VI Part 3,68,1.1.150,YORK,"Why whisper you, my lords, and answer not?"
9679,Henry VI Part 3,69,1.1.151,EXETER,My conscience tells me he is lawful king.
9680,Henry VI Part 3,70,1.1.152,KING HENRY VI,"[Aside]  All will revolt from me, and turn to him."
9681,Henry VI Part 3,71,1.1.153,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Plantagenet, for all the claim thou lay'st,"
9682,Henry VI Part 3,71,1.1.154,NORTHUMBERLAND,Think not that Henry shall be so deposed.
9683,Henry VI Part 3,72,1.1.155,WARWICK,"Deposed he shall be, in despite of all."
9684,Henry VI Part 3,73,1.1.156,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Thou art deceived: 'tis not thy southern power,"
9685,Henry VI Part 3,73,1.1.157,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Of Essex, Norfolk, Suffolk, nor of Kent,"
9686,Henry VI Part 3,73,1.1.158,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Which makes thee thus presumptuous and proud,"
9687,Henry VI Part 3,73,1.1.159,NORTHUMBERLAND,Can set the duke up in despite of me.
9688,Henry VI Part 3,74,1.1.160,CLIFFORD,"King Henry, be thy title right or wrong,"
9689,Henry VI Part 3,74,1.1.161,CLIFFORD,Lord Clifford vows to fight in thy defence:
9690,Henry VI Part 3,74,1.1.162,CLIFFORD,"May that ground gape and swallow me alive,"
9691,Henry VI Part 3,74,1.1.163,CLIFFORD,Where I shall kneel to him that slew my father!
9692,Henry VI Part 3,75,1.1.164,KING HENRY VI,"O Clifford, how thy words revive my heart!"
9693,Henry VI Part 3,76,1.1.165,YORK,"Henry of Lancaster, resign thy crown."
9694,Henry VI Part 3,76,1.1.166,YORK,"What mutter you, or what conspire you, lords?"
9695,Henry VI Part 3,77,1.1.167,WARWICK,"Do right unto this princely Duke of York,"
9696,Henry VI Part 3,77,1.1.168,WARWICK,"Or I will fill the house with armed men,"
9697,Henry VI Part 3,77,1.1.169,WARWICK,"And over the chair of state, where now he sits,"
9698,Henry VI Part 3,77,1.1.170,WARWICK,Write up his title with usurping blood.
9699,Henry VI Part 3,77,,WARWICK,He stamps with his foot and the soldiers show themselves
9700,Henry VI Part 3,78,1.1.171,KING HENRY VI,"My Lord of Warwick, hear me but one word:"
9701,Henry VI Part 3,78,1.1.172,KING HENRY VI,Let me for this my life-time reign as king.
9702,Henry VI Part 3,79,1.1.173,YORK,"Confirm the crown to me and to mine heirs,"
9703,Henry VI Part 3,79,1.1.174,YORK,And thou shalt reign in quiet while thou livest.
9704,Henry VI Part 3,80,1.1.175,KING HENRY VI,"I am content: Richard Plantagenet,"
9705,Henry VI Part 3,80,1.1.176,KING HENRY VI,Enjoy the kingdom after my decease.
9706,Henry VI Part 3,81,1.1.177,CLIFFORD,What wrong is this unto the prince your son!
9707,Henry VI Part 3,82,1.1.178,WARWICK,What good is this to England and himself!
9708,Henry VI Part 3,83,1.1.179,WESTMORELAND,"Base, fearful and despairing Henry!"
9709,Henry VI Part 3,84,1.1.180,CLIFFORD,How hast thou injured both thyself and us!
9710,Henry VI Part 3,85,1.1.181,WESTMORELAND,I cannot stay to hear these articles.
9711,Henry VI Part 3,86,1.1.182,NORTHUMBERLAND,Nor I.
9712,Henry VI Part 3,87,1.1.183,CLIFFORD,"Come, cousin, let us tell the queen these news."
9713,Henry VI Part 3,88,1.1.184,WESTMORELAND,"Farewell, faint-hearted and degenerate king,"
9714,Henry VI Part 3,88,1.1.185,WESTMORELAND,In whose cold blood no spark of honour bides.
9715,Henry VI Part 3,89,1.1.186,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Be thou a prey unto the house of York,"
9716,Henry VI Part 3,89,1.1.187,NORTHUMBERLAND,And die in bands for this unmanly deed!
9717,Henry VI Part 3,90,1.1.188,CLIFFORD,"In dreadful war mayst thou be overcome,"
9718,Henry VI Part 3,90,1.1.189,CLIFFORD,Or live in peace abandon'd and despised!
9719,Henry VI Part 3,90,,CLIFFORD,"Exeunt NORTHUMBERLAND, CLIFFORD, and WESTMORELAND"
9720,Henry VI Part 3,91,1.1.190,WARWICK,"Turn this way, Henry, and regard them not."
9721,Henry VI Part 3,92,1.1.191,EXETER,They seek revenge and therefore will not yield.
9722,Henry VI Part 3,93,1.1.192,KING HENRY VI,"Ah, Exeter!"
9723,Henry VI Part 3,94,1.1.193,WARWICK,"Why should you sigh, my lord?"
9724,Henry VI Part 3,95,1.1.194,KING HENRY VI,"Not for myself, Lord Warwick, but my son,"
9725,Henry VI Part 3,95,1.1.195,KING HENRY VI,Whom I unnaturally shall disinherit.
9726,Henry VI Part 3,95,1.1.196,KING HENRY VI,But be it as it may: I here entail
9727,Henry VI Part 3,95,1.1.197,KING HENRY VI,"The crown to thee and to thine heirs for ever,"
9728,Henry VI Part 3,95,1.1.198,KING HENRY VI,"Conditionally, that here thou take an oath"
9729,Henry VI Part 3,95,1.1.199,KING HENRY VI,"To cease this civil war, and, whilst I live,"
9730,Henry VI Part 3,95,1.1.200,KING HENRY VI,"To honour me as thy king and sovereign,"
9731,Henry VI Part 3,95,1.1.201,KING HENRY VI,And neither by treason nor hostility
9732,Henry VI Part 3,95,1.1.202,KING HENRY VI,To seek to put me down and reign thyself.
9733,Henry VI Part 3,96,1.1.203,YORK,This oath I willingly take and will perform.
9734,Henry VI Part 3,97,1.1.204,WARWICK,Long live King Henry! Plantagenet embrace him.
9735,Henry VI Part 3,98,1.1.205,KING HENRY VI,And long live thou and these thy forward sons!
9736,Henry VI Part 3,99,1.1.206,YORK,Now York and Lancaster are reconciled.
9737,Henry VI Part 3,100,1.1.207,EXETER,Accursed be he that seeks to make them foes!
9738,Henry VI Part 3,100,,EXETER,Sennet. Here they come down
9739,Henry VI Part 3,101,1.1.208,YORK,"Farewell, my gracious lord, I'll to my castle."
9740,Henry VI Part 3,102,1.1.209,WARWICK,And I'll keep London with my soldiers.
9741,Henry VI Part 3,103,1.1.210,NORFOLK,And I to Norfolk with my followers.
9742,Henry VI Part 3,104,1.1.211,MONTAGUE,And I unto the sea from whence I came.

9744,Henry VI Part 3,105,1.1.212,KING HENRY VI,"And I, with grief and sorrow, to the court."
9745,Henry VI Part 3,105,,KING HENRY VI,Enter QUEEN MARGARET and PRINCE EDWARD
9746,Henry VI Part 3,106,1.1.213,EXETER,"Here comes the queen, whose looks bewray her anger:"
9747,Henry VI Part 3,106,1.1.214,EXETER,I'll steal away.
9748,Henry VI Part 3,107,1.1.215,KING HENRY VI,"Exeter, so will I."
9749,Henry VI Part 3,108,1.1.216,QUEEN MARGARET,"Nay, go not from me, I will follow thee."
9750,Henry VI Part 3,109,1.1.217,KING HENRY VI,"Be patient, gentle queen, and I will stay."
9751,Henry VI Part 3,110,1.1.218,QUEEN MARGARET,Who can be patient in such extremes?
9752,Henry VI Part 3,110,1.1.219,QUEEN MARGARET,"Ah, wretched man! would I had died a maid"
9753,Henry VI Part 3,110,1.1.220,QUEEN MARGARET,"And never seen thee, never borne thee son,"
9754,Henry VI Part 3,110,1.1.221,QUEEN MARGARET,Seeing thou hast proved so unnatural a father
9755,Henry VI Part 3,110,1.1.222,QUEEN MARGARET,Hath he deserved to lose his birthright thus?
9756,Henry VI Part 3,110,1.1.223,QUEEN MARGARET,"Hadst thou but loved him half so well as I,"
9757,Henry VI Part 3,110,1.1.224,QUEEN MARGARET,"Or felt that pain which I did for him once,"
9758,Henry VI Part 3,110,1.1.225,QUEEN MARGARET,"Or nourish'd him as I did with my blood,"
9759,Henry VI Part 3,110,1.1.226,QUEEN MARGARET,"Thou wouldst have left thy dearest heart-blood there,"
9760,Henry VI Part 3,110,1.1.227,QUEEN MARGARET,Rather than have that savage duke thine heir
9761,Henry VI Part 3,110,1.1.228,QUEEN MARGARET,And disinherited thine only son.
9762,Henry VI Part 3,111,1.1.229,PRINCE EDWARD,"Father, you cannot disinherit me:"
9763,Henry VI Part 3,111,1.1.230,PRINCE EDWARD,"If you be king, why should not I succeed?"
9764,Henry VI Part 3,112,1.1.231,KING HENRY VI,"Pardon me, Margaret, pardon me, sweet son:"
9765,Henry VI Part 3,112,1.1.232,KING HENRY VI,The Earl of Warwick and the duke enforced me.
9766,Henry VI Part 3,113,1.1.233,QUEEN MARGARET,"Enforced thee! art thou king, and wilt be forced?"
9767,Henry VI Part 3,113,1.1.234,QUEEN MARGARET,"I shame to hear thee speak. Ah, timorous wretch!"
9768,Henry VI Part 3,113,1.1.235,QUEEN MARGARET,"Thou hast undone thyself, thy son and me,"
9769,Henry VI Part 3,113,1.1.236,QUEEN MARGARET,And given unto the house of York such head
9770,Henry VI Part 3,113,1.1.237,QUEEN MARGARET,As thou shalt reign but by their sufferance.
9771,Henry VI Part 3,113,1.1.238,QUEEN MARGARET,"To entail him and his heirs unto the crown,"
9772,Henry VI Part 3,113,1.1.239,QUEEN MARGARET,"What is it, but to make thy sepulchre"
9773,Henry VI Part 3,113,1.1.240,QUEEN MARGARET,And creep into it far before thy time?
9774,Henry VI Part 3,113,1.1.241,QUEEN MARGARET,"Warwick is chancellor and the lord of Calais,"
9775,Henry VI Part 3,113,1.1.242,QUEEN MARGARET,"Stern Falconbridge commands the narrow seas,"
9776,Henry VI Part 3,113,1.1.243,QUEEN MARGARET,"The duke is made protector of the realm,"
9777,Henry VI Part 3,113,1.1.244,QUEEN MARGARET,And yet shalt thou be safe? such safety finds
9778,Henry VI Part 3,113,1.1.245,QUEEN MARGARET,The trembling lamb environed with wolves.
9779,Henry VI Part 3,113,1.1.246,QUEEN MARGARET,"Had I been there, which am a silly woman,"
9780,Henry VI Part 3,113,1.1.247,QUEEN MARGARET,The soldiers should have toss'd me on their pikes
9781,Henry VI Part 3,113,1.1.248,QUEEN MARGARET,Before I would have granted to that act.
9782,Henry VI Part 3,113,1.1.249,QUEEN MARGARET,But thou preferr'st thy life before thine honour:
9783,Henry VI Part 3,113,1.1.250,QUEEN MARGARET,"And seeing thou dost, I here divorce myself"
9784,Henry VI Part 3,113,1.1.251,QUEEN MARGARET,"Both from thy table, Henry, and thy bed,"
9785,Henry VI Part 3,113,1.1.252,QUEEN MARGARET,Until that act of parliament be repeal'd
9786,Henry VI Part 3,113,1.1.253,QUEEN MARGARET,Whereby my son is disinherited.
9787,Henry VI Part 3,113,1.1.254,QUEEN MARGARET,The northern lords that have forsworn thy colours
9788,Henry VI Part 3,113,1.1.255,QUEEN MARGARET,"Will follow mine, if once they see them spread,"
9789,Henry VI Part 3,113,1.1.256,QUEEN MARGARET,"And spread they shall be, to thy foul disgrace"
9790,Henry VI Part 3,113,1.1.257,QUEEN MARGARET,And utter ruin of the house of York.
9791,Henry VI Part 3,113,1.1.258,QUEEN MARGARET,"Thus do I leave thee. Come, son, let's away,"
9792,Henry VI Part 3,113,1.1.259,QUEEN MARGARET,"Our army is ready, come, we'll after them."
9793,Henry VI Part 3,114,1.1.260,KING HENRY VI,"Stay, gentle Margaret, and hear me speak."
9794,Henry VI Part 3,115,1.1.261,QUEEN MARGARET,Thou hast spoke too much already: get thee gone.
9795,Henry VI Part 3,116,1.1.262,KING HENRY VI,"Gentle son Edward, thou wilt stay with me?"
9796,Henry VI Part 3,117,1.1.263,QUEEN MARGARET,"Ay, to be murder'd by his enemies."
9797,Henry VI Part 3,118,1.1.264,PRINCE EDWARD,When I return with victory from the field
9798,Henry VI Part 3,118,1.1.265,PRINCE EDWARD,I'll see your grace: till then I'll follow her.
9799,Henry VI Part 3,119,1.1.266,QUEEN MARGARET,"Come, son, away, we may not linger thus."
9800,Henry VI Part 3,119,,QUEEN MARGARET,Exeunt QUEEN MARGARET and PRINCE EDWARD
9801,Henry VI Part 3,120,1.1.267,KING HENRY VI,Poor queen! how love to me and to her son
9802,Henry VI Part 3,120,1.1.268,KING HENRY VI,Hath made her break out into terms of rage!
9803,Henry VI Part 3,120,1.1.269,KING HENRY VI,"Revenged may she be on that hateful duke,"
9804,Henry VI Part 3,120,1.1.270,KING HENRY VI,"Whose haughty spirit, winged with desire,"
9805,Henry VI Part 3,120,1.1.271,KING HENRY VI,"Will cost my crown, and like an empty eagle"
9806,Henry VI Part 3,120,1.1.272,KING HENRY VI,Tire on the flesh of me and of my son!
9807,Henry VI Part 3,120,1.1.273,KING HENRY VI,The loss of those three lords torments my heart:
9808,Henry VI Part 3,120,1.1.274,KING HENRY VI,I'll write unto them and entreat them fair.
9809,Henry VI Part 3,120,1.1.275,KING HENRY VI,"Come, cousin you shall be the messenger."
9810,Henry VI Part 3,121,1.1.276,EXETER,"And I, I hope, shall reconcile them all."
9811,Henry VI Part 3,121,,EXETER,Exeunt
9812,Henry VI Part 3,121,,EXETER,SCENE II. Sandal Castle.
9813,Henry VI Part 3,121,,EXETER,"Enter RICHARD, EDWARD, and MONTAGUE"
9814,Henry VI Part 3,1,1.2.1,RICHARD,"Brother, though I be youngest, give me leave."
9815,Henry VI Part 3,2,1.2.2,EDWARD,"No, I can better play the orator."
9816,Henry VI Part 3,3,1.2.3,MONTAGUE,But I have reasons strong and forcible.
9817,Henry VI Part 3,3,,MONTAGUE,Enter YORK
9818,Henry VI Part 3,4,1.2.4,YORK,"Why, how now, sons and brother! at a strife?"
9819,Henry VI Part 3,4,1.2.5,YORK,What is your quarrel? how began it first?
9820,Henry VI Part 3,5,1.2.6,EDWARD,"No quarrel, but a slight contention."
9821,Henry VI Part 3,6,1.2.7,YORK,About what?
9822,Henry VI Part 3,7,1.2.8,RICHARD,"About that which concerns your grace and us,"
9823,Henry VI Part 3,7,1.2.9,RICHARD,"The crown of England, father, which is yours."
9824,Henry VI Part 3,8,1.2.10,YORK,Mine boy? not till King Henry be dead.
9825,Henry VI Part 3,9,1.2.11,RICHARD,Your right depends not on his life or death.
9826,Henry VI Part 3,10,1.2.12,EDWARD,"Now you are heir, therefore enjoy it now:"
9827,Henry VI Part 3,10,1.2.13,EDWARD,"By giving the house of Lancaster leave to breathe,"
9828,Henry VI Part 3,10,1.2.14,EDWARD,"It will outrun you, father, in the end."
9829,Henry VI Part 3,11,1.2.15,YORK,I took an oath that he should quietly reign.
9830,Henry VI Part 3,12,1.2.16,EDWARD,But for a kingdom any oath may be broken:
9831,Henry VI Part 3,12,1.2.17,EDWARD,I would break a thousand oaths to reign one year.
9832,Henry VI Part 3,13,1.2.18,RICHARD,"No, God forbid your grace should be forsworn."
9833,Henry VI Part 3,14,1.2.19,YORK,"I shall be, if I claim by open war."
9834,Henry VI Part 3,15,1.2.20,RICHARD,"I'll prove the contrary, if you'll hear me speak."
9835,Henry VI Part 3,16,1.2.21,YORK,"Thou canst not, son, it is impossible."
9836,Henry VI Part 3,17,1.2.22,RICHARD,"An oath is of no moment, being not took"
9837,Henry VI Part 3,17,1.2.23,RICHARD,"Before a true and lawful magistrate,"
9838,Henry VI Part 3,17,1.2.24,RICHARD,That hath authority over him that swears:
9839,Henry VI Part 3,17,1.2.25,RICHARD,"Henry had none, but did usurp the place,"
9840,Henry VI Part 3,17,1.2.26,RICHARD,"Then, seeing 'twas he that made you to depose,"
9841,Henry VI Part 3,17,1.2.27,RICHARD,"Your oath, my lord, is vain and frivolous."
9842,Henry VI Part 3,17,1.2.28,RICHARD,"Therefore, to arms! And, father, do but think"
9843,Henry VI Part 3,17,1.2.29,RICHARD,"How sweet a thing it is to wear a crown,"
9844,Henry VI Part 3,17,1.2.30,RICHARD,Within whose circuit is Elysium
9845,Henry VI Part 3,17,1.2.31,RICHARD,And all that poets feign of bliss and joy.
9846,Henry VI Part 3,17,1.2.32,RICHARD,Why do we finger thus? I cannot rest
9847,Henry VI Part 3,17,1.2.33,RICHARD,Until the white rose that I wear be dyed
9848,Henry VI Part 3,17,1.2.34,RICHARD,Even in the lukewarm blood of Henry's heart.
9849,Henry VI Part 3,18,1.2.35,YORK,"Richard, enough, I will be king, or die."
9850,Henry VI Part 3,18,1.2.36,YORK,"Brother, thou shalt to London presently,"
9851,Henry VI Part 3,18,1.2.37,YORK,And whet on Warwick to this enterprise.
9852,Henry VI Part 3,18,1.2.38,YORK,"Thou, Richard, shalt to the Duke of Norfolk,"
9853,Henry VI Part 3,18,1.2.39,YORK,And tell him privily of our intent.
9854,Henry VI Part 3,18,1.2.40,YORK,"You Edward, shall unto my Lord Cobham,"
9855,Henry VI Part 3,18,1.2.41,YORK,With whom the Kentishmen will willingly rise:
9856,Henry VI Part 3,18,1.2.42,YORK,"In them I trust, for they are soldiers,"
9857,Henry VI Part 3,18,1.2.43,YORK,"Witty, courteous, liberal, full of spirit."
9858,Henry VI Part 3,18,1.2.44,YORK,"While you are thus employ'd, what resteth more,"
9859,Henry VI Part 3,18,1.2.45,YORK,"But that I seek occasion how to rise,"
9860,Henry VI Part 3,18,1.2.46,YORK,"And yet the king not privy to my drift,"
9861,Henry VI Part 3,18,1.2.47,YORK,Nor any of the house of Lancaster?
9862,Henry VI Part 3,18,,YORK,Enter a Messenger
9863,Henry VI Part 3,18,1.2.48,YORK,"But, stay: what news? Why comest thou in such post?"
9864,Henry VI Part 3,19,1.2.49,Messenger,The queen with all the northern earls and lords
9865,Henry VI Part 3,19,1.2.50,Messenger,Intend here to besiege you in your castle:
9866,Henry VI Part 3,19,1.2.51,Messenger,"She is hard by with twenty thousand men,"
9867,Henry VI Part 3,19,1.2.52,Messenger,"And therefore fortify your hold, my lord."
9868,Henry VI Part 3,20,1.2.53,YORK,"Ay, with my sword. What! think'st thou that we fear them?"
9869,Henry VI Part 3,20,1.2.54,YORK,"Edward and Richard, you shall stay with me,"
9870,Henry VI Part 3,20,1.2.55,YORK,My brother Montague shall post to London:
9871,Henry VI Part 3,20,1.2.56,YORK,"Let noble Warwick, Cobham, and the rest,"
9872,Henry VI Part 3,20,1.2.57,YORK,"Whom we have left protectors of the king,"
9873,Henry VI Part 3,20,1.2.58,YORK,"With powerful policy strengthen themselves,"
9874,Henry VI Part 3,20,1.2.59,YORK,And trust not simple Henry nor his oaths.
9875,Henry VI Part 3,21,1.2.60,MONTAGUE,"Brother, I go, I'll win them, fear it not:"
9876,Henry VI Part 3,21,1.2.61,MONTAGUE,And thus most humbly I do take my leave.
9877,Henry VI Part 3,21,,MONTAGUE,Exit
9878,Henry VI Part 3,21,,MONTAGUE,Enter JOHN MORTIMER and HUGH MORTIMER
9879,Henry VI Part 3,21,1.2.62,MONTAGUE,"Sir John and Sir Hugh Mortimer, mine uncles,"
9880,Henry VI Part 3,21,1.2.63,MONTAGUE,"You are come to Sandal in a happy hour,"
9881,Henry VI Part 3,21,1.2.64,MONTAGUE,The army of the queen mean to besiege us.
9882,Henry VI Part 3,22,1.2.65,JOHN MORTIMER,"She shall not need, we'll meet her in the field."
9883,Henry VI Part 3,23,1.2.66,YORK,"What, with five thousand men?"
9884,Henry VI Part 3,24,1.2.67,RICHARD,"Ay, with five hundred, father, for a need:"
9885,Henry VI Part 3,24,1.2.68,RICHARD,"A woman's general, what should we fear?"
9886,Henry VI Part 3,24,,RICHARD,A march afar off
9887,Henry VI Part 3,25,1.2.69,EDWARD,"I hear their drums: let's set our men in order,"
9888,Henry VI Part 3,25,1.2.70,EDWARD,And issue forth and bid them battle straight.
9889,Henry VI Part 3,26,1.2.71,YORK,"Five men to twenty! though the odds be great,"
9890,Henry VI Part 3,26,1.2.72,YORK,"I doubt not, uncle, of our victory."
9891,Henry VI Part 3,26,1.2.73,YORK,"Many a battle have I won in France,"
9892,Henry VI Part 3,26,1.2.74,YORK,When as the enemy hath been ten to one:
9893,Henry VI Part 3,26,1.2.75,YORK,Why should I not now have the like success?
9894,Henry VI Part 3,26,,YORK,Alarum. Exeunt
9895,Henry VI Part 3,26,,YORK,SCENE III. Field of battle betwixt Sandal Castle and Wakefield.
9896,Henry VI Part 3,26,,YORK,Alarums. Enter RUTLAND and his Tutor
9897,Henry VI Part 3,1,1.3.1,RUTLAND,"Ah, whither shall I fly to 'scape their hands?"
9898,Henry VI Part 3,1,1.3.2,RUTLAND,"Ah, tutor, look where bloody Clifford comes!"
9899,Henry VI Part 3,1,,RUTLAND,Enter CLIFFORD and Soldiers
9900,Henry VI Part 3,2,1.3.3,CLIFFORD,"Chaplain, away! thy priesthood saves thy life."
9901,Henry VI Part 3,2,1.3.4,CLIFFORD,"As for the brat of this accursed duke,"
9902,Henry VI Part 3,2,1.3.5,CLIFFORD,"Whose father slew my father, he shall die."
9903,Henry VI Part 3,3,1.3.6,Tutor,"And I, my lord, will bear him company."
9904,Henry VI Part 3,4,1.3.7,CLIFFORD,"Soldiers, away with him!"
9905,Henry VI Part 3,5,1.3.8,Tutor,"Ah, Clifford, murder not this innocent child,"
9906,Henry VI Part 3,5,1.3.9,Tutor,Lest thou be hated both of God and man!
9907,Henry VI Part 3,5,,Tutor,"Exit, dragged off by Soldiers"
9908,Henry VI Part 3,6,1.3.10,CLIFFORD,How now! is he dead already? or is it fear
9909,Henry VI Part 3,6,1.3.11,CLIFFORD,That makes him close his eyes? I'll open them.
9910,Henry VI Part 3,7,1.3.12,RUTLAND,So looks the pent-up lion o'er the wretch
9911,Henry VI Part 3,7,1.3.13,RUTLAND,"That trembles under his devouring paws,"
9912,Henry VI Part 3,7,1.3.14,RUTLAND,"And so he walks, insulting o'er his prey,"
9913,Henry VI Part 3,7,1.3.15,RUTLAND,"And so he comes, to rend his limbs asunder."
9914,Henry VI Part 3,7,1.3.16,RUTLAND,"Ah, gentle Clifford, kill me with thy sword,"
9915,Henry VI Part 3,7,1.3.17,RUTLAND,And not with such a cruel threatening look.
9916,Henry VI Part 3,7,1.3.18,RUTLAND,"Sweet Clifford, hear me speak before I die."
9917,Henry VI Part 3,7,1.3.19,RUTLAND,I am too mean a subject for thy wrath:
9918,Henry VI Part 3,7,1.3.20,RUTLAND,"Be thou revenged on men, and let me live."
9919,Henry VI Part 3,8,1.3.21,CLIFFORD,"In vain thou speak'st, poor boy, my father's blood"
9920,Henry VI Part 3,8,1.3.22,CLIFFORD,Hath stopp'd the passage where thy words should enter.
9921,Henry VI Part 3,9,1.3.23,RUTLAND,Then let my father's blood open it again:
9922,Henry VI Part 3,9,1.3.24,RUTLAND,"He is a man, and, Clifford, cope with him."
9923,Henry VI Part 3,10,1.3.25,CLIFFORD,"Had thy brethren here, their lives and thine"
9924,Henry VI Part 3,10,1.3.26,CLIFFORD,"Were not revenge sufficient for me,"
9925,Henry VI Part 3,10,1.3.27,CLIFFORD,"No, if I digg'd up thy forefathers' graves"
9926,Henry VI Part 3,10,1.3.28,CLIFFORD,"And hung their rotten coffins up in chains,"
9927,Henry VI Part 3,10,1.3.29,CLIFFORD,"It could not slake mine ire, nor ease my heart."
9928,Henry VI Part 3,10,1.3.30,CLIFFORD,The sight of any of the house of York
9929,Henry VI Part 3,10,1.3.31,CLIFFORD,"Is as a fury to torment my soul,"
9930,Henry VI Part 3,10,1.3.32,CLIFFORD,And till I root out their accursed line
9931,Henry VI Part 3,10,1.3.33,CLIFFORD,"And leave not one alive, I live in hell."
9932,Henry VI Part 3,10,1.3.34,CLIFFORD,Therefore--
9933,Henry VI Part 3,10,,CLIFFORD,Lifting his hand
9934,Henry VI Part 3,11,1.3.35,RUTLAND,"O, let me pray before I take my death!"
9935,Henry VI Part 3,11,1.3.36,RUTLAND,"To thee I pray, sweet Clifford, pity me!"
9936,Henry VI Part 3,12,1.3.37,CLIFFORD,Such pity as my rapier's point affords.
9937,Henry VI Part 3,13,1.3.38,RUTLAND,I never did thee harm: why wilt thou slay me?
9938,Henry VI Part 3,14,1.3.39,CLIFFORD,Thy father hath.
9939,Henry VI Part 3,15,1.3.40,RUTLAND,But 'twas ere I was born.
9940,Henry VI Part 3,15,1.3.41,RUTLAND,"Thou hast one son, for his sake pity me,"
9941,Henry VI Part 3,15,1.3.42,RUTLAND,"Lest in revenge thereof, sith God is just,"
9942,Henry VI Part 3,15,1.3.43,RUTLAND,He be as miserably slain as I.
9943,Henry VI Part 3,15,1.3.44,RUTLAND,"Ah, let me live in prison all my days,"
9944,Henry VI Part 3,15,1.3.45,RUTLAND,"And when I give occasion of offence,"
9945,Henry VI Part 3,15,1.3.46,RUTLAND,"Then let me die, for now thou hast no cause."
9946,Henry VI Part 3,16,1.3.47,CLIFFORD,No cause!
9947,Henry VI Part 3,16,1.3.48,CLIFFORD,"Thy father slew my father, therefore, die."
9948,Henry VI Part 3,16,,CLIFFORD,Stabs him
9949,Henry VI Part 3,17,1.3.49,RUTLAND,Di faciant laudis summa sit ista tuae!
9950,Henry VI Part 3,17,,RUTLAND,Dies
9951,Henry VI Part 3,18,1.3.50,CLIFFORD,"Plantagenet! I come, Plantagenet!"
9952,Henry VI Part 3,18,1.3.51,CLIFFORD,And this thy son's blood cleaving to my blade
9953,Henry VI Part 3,18,1.3.52,CLIFFORD,"Shall rust upon my weapon, till thy blood,"
9954,Henry VI Part 3,18,1.3.53,CLIFFORD,"Congeal'd with this, do make me wipe off both."
9955,Henry VI Part 3,18,,CLIFFORD,Exit
9956,Henry VI Part 3,18,,CLIFFORD,SCENE IV. Another part of the field.
9957,Henry VI Part 3,18,,CLIFFORD,Alarum. Enter YORK
9958,Henry VI Part 3,1,1.4.1,YORK,The army of the queen hath got the field:
9959,Henry VI Part 3,1,1.4.2,YORK,"My uncles both are slain in rescuing me,"
9960,Henry VI Part 3,1,1.4.3,YORK,And all my followers to the eager foe
9961,Henry VI Part 3,1,1.4.4,YORK,"Turn back and fly, like ships before the wind"
9962,Henry VI Part 3,1,1.4.5,YORK,Or lambs pursued by hunger-starved wolves.
9963,Henry VI Part 3,1,1.4.6,YORK,"My sons, God knows what hath bechanced them:"
9964,Henry VI Part 3,1,1.4.7,YORK,"But this I know, they have demean'd themselves"
9965,Henry VI Part 3,1,1.4.8,YORK,Like men born to renown by life or death.
9966,Henry VI Part 3,1,1.4.9,YORK,Three times did Richard make a lane to me.
9967,Henry VI Part 3,1,1.4.10,YORK,"And thrice cried 'Courage, father! fight it out!'"
9968,Henry VI Part 3,1,1.4.11,YORK,"And full as oft came Edward to my side,"
9969,Henry VI Part 3,1,1.4.12,YORK,"With purple falchion, painted to the hilt"
9970,Henry VI Part 3,1,1.4.13,YORK,In blood of those that had encounter'd him:
9971,Henry VI Part 3,1,1.4.14,YORK,"And when the hardiest warriors did retire,"
9972,Henry VI Part 3,1,1.4.15,YORK,Richard cried 'Charge! and give no foot of ground!'
9973,Henry VI Part 3,1,1.4.16,YORK,"And cried 'A crown, or else a glorious tomb!"
9974,Henry VI Part 3,1,1.4.17,YORK,"A sceptre, or an earthly sepulchre!'"
9975,Henry VI Part 3,1,1.4.18,YORK,"With this, we charged again: but, out, alas!"
9976,Henry VI Part 3,1,1.4.19,YORK,"We bodged again, as I have seen a swan"
9977,Henry VI Part 3,1,1.4.20,YORK,With bootless labour swim against the tide
9978,Henry VI Part 3,1,1.4.21,YORK,And spend her strength with over-matching waves.
9979,Henry VI Part 3,1,,YORK,A short alarum within
9980,Henry VI Part 3,1,1.4.22,YORK,"Ah, hark! the fatal followers do pursue,"
9981,Henry VI Part 3,1,1.4.23,YORK,And I am faint and cannot fly their fury:
9982,Henry VI Part 3,1,1.4.24,YORK,"And were I strong, I would not shun their fury:"
9983,Henry VI Part 3,1,1.4.25,YORK,"The sands are number'd that make up my life,"
9984,Henry VI Part 3,1,1.4.26,YORK,"Here must I stay, and here my life must end."
9985,Henry VI Part 3,1,,YORK,"Enter QUEEN MARGARET, CLIFFORD, NORTHUMBERLAND, PRINCE EDWARD, and Soldiers"
9986,Henry VI Part 3,1,1.4.27,YORK,"Come, bloody Clifford, rough Northumberland,"
9987,Henry VI Part 3,1,1.4.28,YORK,I dare your quenchless fury to more rage:
9988,Henry VI Part 3,1,1.4.29,YORK,"I am your butt, and I abide your shot."
9989,Henry VI Part 3,2,1.4.30,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Yield to our mercy, proud Plantagenet."
9990,Henry VI Part 3,3,1.4.31,CLIFFORD,"Ay, to such mercy as his ruthless arm,"
9991,Henry VI Part 3,3,1.4.32,CLIFFORD,"With downright payment, show'd unto my father."
9992,Henry VI Part 3,3,1.4.33,CLIFFORD,"Now Phaethon hath tumbled from his car,"
9993,Henry VI Part 3,3,1.4.34,CLIFFORD,And made an evening at the noontide prick.
9994,Henry VI Part 3,4,1.4.35,YORK,"My ashes, as the phoenix, may bring forth"
9995,Henry VI Part 3,4,1.4.36,YORK,A bird that will revenge upon you all:
9996,Henry VI Part 3,4,1.4.37,YORK,"And in that hope I throw mine eyes to heaven,"
9997,Henry VI Part 3,4,1.4.38,YORK,Scorning whate'er you can afflict me with.
9998,Henry VI Part 3,4,1.4.39,YORK,"Why come you not? what! multitudes, and fear?"
9999,Henry VI Part 3,5,1.4.40,CLIFFORD,"So cowards fight when they can fly no further,"
10000,Henry VI Part 3,5,1.4.41,CLIFFORD,"So doves do peck the falcon's piercing talons,"
10001,Henry VI Part 3,5,1.4.42,CLIFFORD,"So desperate thieves, all hopeless of their lives,"
10002,Henry VI Part 3,5,1.4.43,CLIFFORD,Breathe out invectives 'gainst the officers.
10003,Henry VI Part 3,6,1.4.44,YORK,"O Clifford, but bethink thee once again,"
10004,Henry VI Part 3,6,1.4.45,YORK,"And in thy thought o'er-run my former time,"
10005,Henry VI Part 3,6,1.4.46,YORK,"And, if though canst for blushing, view this face,"
10006,Henry VI Part 3,6,1.4.47,YORK,"And bite thy tongue, that slanders him with cowardice"
10007,Henry VI Part 3,6,1.4.48,YORK,Whose frown hath made thee faint and fly ere this!
10008,Henry VI Part 3,7,1.4.49,CLIFFORD,"I will not bandy with thee word for word,"
10009,Henry VI Part 3,7,1.4.50,CLIFFORD,"But buckle with thee blows, twice two for one."
10010,Henry VI Part 3,8,1.4.51,QUEEN MARGARET,"Hold, valiant Clifford! for a thousand causes"
10011,Henry VI Part 3,8,1.4.52,QUEEN MARGARET,I would prolong awhile the traitor's life.
10012,Henry VI Part 3,8,1.4.53,QUEEN MARGARET,"Wrath makes him deaf: speak thou, Northumberland."
10013,Henry VI Part 3,9,1.4.54,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Hold, Clifford! do not honour him so much"
10014,Henry VI Part 3,9,1.4.55,NORTHUMBERLAND,"To prick thy finger, though to wound his heart:"
10015,Henry VI Part 3,9,1.4.56,NORTHUMBERLAND,"What valour were it, when a cur doth grin,"
10016,Henry VI Part 3,9,1.4.57,NORTHUMBERLAND,"For one to thrust his hand between his teeth,"
10017,Henry VI Part 3,9,1.4.58,NORTHUMBERLAND,When he might spurn him with his foot away?
10018,Henry VI Part 3,9,1.4.59,NORTHUMBERLAND,"It is war's prize to take all vantages,"
10019,Henry VI Part 3,9,1.4.60,NORTHUMBERLAND,And ten to one is no impeach of valour.
10020,Henry VI Part 3,9,,NORTHUMBERLAND,"They lay hands on YORK, who struggles"
10021,Henry VI Part 3,10,1.4.61,CLIFFORD,"Ay, ay, so strives the woodcock with the gin."
10022,Henry VI Part 3,11,1.4.62,NORTHUMBERLAND,So doth the cony struggle in the net.
10023,Henry VI Part 3,12,1.4.63,YORK,"So triumph thieves upon their conquer'd booty,"
10024,Henry VI Part 3,12,1.4.64,YORK,"So true men yield, with robbers so o'ermatch'd."
10025,Henry VI Part 3,13,1.4.65,NORTHUMBERLAND,What would your grace have done unto him now?
10026,Henry VI Part 3,14,1.4.66,QUEEN MARGARET,"Brave warriors, Clifford and Northumberland,"
10027,Henry VI Part 3,14,1.4.67,QUEEN MARGARET,"Come, make him stand upon this molehill here,"
10028,Henry VI Part 3,14,1.4.68,QUEEN MARGARET,"That raught at mountains with outstretched arms,"
10029,Henry VI Part 3,14,1.4.69,QUEEN MARGARET,Yet parted but the shadow with his hand.
10030,Henry VI Part 3,14,1.4.70,QUEEN MARGARET,What! was it you that would be England's king?
10031,Henry VI Part 3,14,1.4.71,QUEEN MARGARET,"Was't you that revell'd in our parliament,"
10032,Henry VI Part 3,14,1.4.72,QUEEN MARGARET,And made a preachment of your high descent?
10033,Henry VI Part 3,14,1.4.73,QUEEN MARGARET,Where are your mess of sons to back you now?
10034,Henry VI Part 3,14,1.4.74,QUEEN MARGARET,"The wanton Edward, and the lusty George?"
10035,Henry VI Part 3,14,1.4.75,QUEEN MARGARET,"And where's that valiant crook-back prodigy,"
10036,Henry VI Part 3,14,1.4.76,QUEEN MARGARET,"Dicky your boy, that with his grumbling voice"
10037,Henry VI Part 3,14,1.4.77,QUEEN MARGARET,Was wont to cheer his dad in mutinies?
10038,Henry VI Part 3,14,1.4.78,QUEEN MARGARET,"Or, with the rest, where is your darling Rutland?"
10039,Henry VI Part 3,14,1.4.79,QUEEN MARGARET,"Look, York: I stain'd this napkin with the blood"
10040,Henry VI Part 3,14,1.4.80,QUEEN MARGARET,"That valiant Clifford, with his rapier's point,"
10041,Henry VI Part 3,14,1.4.81,QUEEN MARGARET,"Made issue from the bosom of the boy,"
10042,Henry VI Part 3,14,1.4.82,QUEEN MARGARET,"And if thine eyes can water for his death,"
10043,Henry VI Part 3,14,1.4.83,QUEEN MARGARET,I give thee this to dry thy cheeks withal.
10044,Henry VI Part 3,14,1.4.84,QUEEN MARGARET,"Alas poor York! but that I hate thee deadly,"
10045,Henry VI Part 3,14,1.4.85,QUEEN MARGARET,I should lament thy miserable state.
10046,Henry VI Part 3,14,1.4.86,QUEEN MARGARET,"I prithee, grieve, to make me merry, York."
10047,Henry VI Part 3,14,1.4.87,QUEEN MARGARET,"What, hath thy fiery heart so parch'd thine entrails"
10048,Henry VI Part 3,14,1.4.88,QUEEN MARGARET,That not a tear can fall for Rutland's death?
10049,Henry VI Part 3,14,1.4.89,QUEEN MARGARET,"Why art thou patient, man? thou shouldst be mad,"
10050,Henry VI Part 3,14,1.4.90,QUEEN MARGARET,"And I, to make thee mad, do mock thee thus."
10051,Henry VI Part 3,14,1.4.91,QUEEN MARGARET,"Stamp, rave, and fret, that I may sing and dance."
10052,Henry VI Part 3,14,1.4.92,QUEEN MARGARET,"Thou wouldst be fee'd, I see, to make me sport:"
10053,Henry VI Part 3,14,1.4.93,QUEEN MARGARET,"York cannot speak, unless he wear a crown."
10054,Henry VI Part 3,14,1.4.94,QUEEN MARGARET,"A crown for York! and, lords, bow low to him:"
10055,Henry VI Part 3,14,1.4.95,QUEEN MARGARET,"Hold you his hands, whilst I do set it on."
10056,Henry VI Part 3,14,,QUEEN MARGARET,Putting a paper crown on his head
10057,Henry VI Part 3,14,1.4.96,QUEEN MARGARET,"Ay, marry, sir, now looks he like a king!"
10058,Henry VI Part 3,14,1.4.97,QUEEN MARGARET,"Ay, this is he that took King Henry's chair,"
10059,Henry VI Part 3,14,1.4.98,QUEEN MARGARET,And this is he was his adopted heir.
10060,Henry VI Part 3,14,1.4.99,QUEEN MARGARET,But how is it that great Plantagenet
10061,Henry VI Part 3,14,1.4.100,QUEEN MARGARET,"Is crown'd so soon, and broke his solemn oath?"
10062,Henry VI Part 3,14,1.4.101,QUEEN MARGARET,"As I bethink me, you should not be king"
10063,Henry VI Part 3,14,1.4.102,QUEEN MARGARET,Till our King Henry had shook hands with death.
10064,Henry VI Part 3,14,1.4.103,QUEEN MARGARET,"And will you pale your head in Henry's glory,"
10065,Henry VI Part 3,14,1.4.104,QUEEN MARGARET,"And rob his temples of the diadem,"
10066,Henry VI Part 3,14,1.4.105,QUEEN MARGARET,"Now in his life, against your holy oath?"
10067,Henry VI Part 3,14,1.4.106,QUEEN MARGARET,"O, 'tis a fault too too unpardonable!"
10068,Henry VI Part 3,14,1.4.107,QUEEN MARGARET,"Off with the crown, and with the crown his head,"
10069,Henry VI Part 3,14,1.4.108,QUEEN MARGARET,"And, whilst we breathe, take time to do him dead."
10070,Henry VI Part 3,15,1.4.109,CLIFFORD,"That is my office, for my father's sake."
10071,Henry VI Part 3,16,1.4.110,QUEEN MARGARET,"Nay, stay, lets hear the orisons he makes."
10072,Henry VI Part 3,17,1.4.111,YORK,"She-wolf of France, but worse than wolves of France,"
10073,Henry VI Part 3,17,1.4.112,YORK,Whose tongue more poisons than the adder's tooth!
10074,Henry VI Part 3,17,1.4.113,YORK,How ill-beseeming is it in thy sex
10075,Henry VI Part 3,17,1.4.114,YORK,"To triumph, like an Amazonian trull,"
10076,Henry VI Part 3,17,1.4.115,YORK,Upon their woes whom fortune captivates!
10077,Henry VI Part 3,17,1.4.116,YORK,"But that thy face is, vizard-like, unchanging,"
10078,Henry VI Part 3,17,1.4.117,YORK,"Made impudent with use of evil deeds,"
10079,Henry VI Part 3,17,1.4.118,YORK,"I would assay, proud queen, to make thee blush."
10080,Henry VI Part 3,17,1.4.119,YORK,"To tell thee whence thou camest, of whom derived,"
10081,Henry VI Part 3,17,1.4.120,YORK,"Were shame enough to shame thee, wert thou not shameless."
10082,Henry VI Part 3,17,1.4.121,YORK,"Thy father bears the type of King of Naples,"
10083,Henry VI Part 3,17,1.4.122,YORK,"Of both the Sicils and Jerusalem,"
10084,Henry VI Part 3,17,1.4.123,YORK,Yet not so wealthy as an English yeoman.
10085,Henry VI Part 3,17,1.4.124,YORK,Hath that poor monarch taught thee to insult?
10086,Henry VI Part 3,17,1.4.125,YORK,"It needs not, nor it boots thee not, proud queen,"
10087,Henry VI Part 3,17,1.4.126,YORK,"Unless the adage must be verified,"
10088,Henry VI Part 3,17,1.4.127,YORK,That beggars mounted run their horse to death.
10089,Henry VI Part 3,17,1.4.128,YORK,"'Tis beauty that doth oft make women proud,"
10090,Henry VI Part 3,17,1.4.129,YORK,"But, God he knows, thy share thereof is small:"
10091,Henry VI Part 3,17,1.4.130,YORK,"'Tis virtue that doth make them most admired,"
10092,Henry VI Part 3,17,1.4.131,YORK,The contrary doth make thee wonder'd at:
10093,Henry VI Part 3,17,1.4.132,YORK,"'Tis government that makes them seem divine,"
10094,Henry VI Part 3,17,1.4.133,YORK,The want thereof makes thee abominable:
10095,Henry VI Part 3,17,1.4.134,YORK,Thou art as opposite to every good
10096,Henry VI Part 3,17,1.4.135,YORK,"As the Antipodes are unto us,"
10097,Henry VI Part 3,17,1.4.136,YORK,Or as the south to the septentrion.
10098,Henry VI Part 3,17,1.4.137,YORK,O tiger's heart wrapt in a woman's hide!
10099,Henry VI Part 3,17,1.4.138,YORK,"How couldst thou drain the life-blood of the child,"
10100,Henry VI Part 3,17,1.4.139,YORK,"To bid the father wipe his eyes withal,"
10101,Henry VI Part 3,17,1.4.140,YORK,And yet be seen to bear a woman's face?
10102,Henry VI Part 3,17,1.4.141,YORK,"Women are soft, mild, pitiful and flexible,"
10103,Henry VI Part 3,17,1.4.142,YORK,"Thou stern, obdurate, flinty, rough, remorseless."
10104,Henry VI Part 3,17,1.4.143,YORK,"Bids't thou me rage? why, now thou hast thy wish:"
10105,Henry VI Part 3,17,1.4.144,YORK,"Wouldst have me weep? why, now thou hast thy will:"
10106,Henry VI Part 3,17,1.4.145,YORK,"For raging wind blows up incessant showers,"
10107,Henry VI Part 3,17,1.4.146,YORK,"And when the rage allays, the rain begins."
10108,Henry VI Part 3,17,1.4.147,YORK,These tears are my sweet Rutland's obsequies:
10109,Henry VI Part 3,17,1.4.148,YORK,"And every drop cries vengeance for his death,"
10110,Henry VI Part 3,17,1.4.149,YORK,"'Gainst thee, fell Clifford, and thee, false"
10111,Henry VI Part 3,17,1.4.150,YORK,Frenchwoman.
10112,Henry VI Part 3,18,1.4.151,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Beshrew me, but his passion moves me so"
10113,Henry VI Part 3,18,1.4.152,NORTHUMBERLAND,That hardly can I cheque my eyes from tears.
10114,Henry VI Part 3,19,1.4.153,YORK,That face of his the hungry cannibals
10115,Henry VI Part 3,19,1.4.154,YORK,"Would not have touch'd, would not have stain'd with blood:"
10116,Henry VI Part 3,19,1.4.155,YORK,"But you are more inhuman, more inexorable,"
10117,Henry VI Part 3,19,1.4.156,YORK,"O, ten times more, than tigers of Hyrcania."
10118,Henry VI Part 3,19,1.4.157,YORK,"See, ruthless queen, a hapless father's tears:"
10119,Henry VI Part 3,19,1.4.158,YORK,"This cloth thou dip'dst in blood of my sweet boy,"
10120,Henry VI Part 3,19,1.4.159,YORK,And I with tears do wash the blood away.
10121,Henry VI Part 3,19,1.4.160,YORK,"Keep thou the napkin, and go boast of this:"
10122,Henry VI Part 3,19,1.4.161,YORK,"And if thou tell'st the heavy story right,"
10123,Henry VI Part 3,19,1.4.162,YORK,"Upon my soul, the hearers will shed tears,"
10124,Henry VI Part 3,19,1.4.163,YORK,"Yea even my foes will shed fast-falling tears,"
10125,Henry VI Part 3,19,1.4.164,YORK,"And say 'Alas, it was a piteous deed!'"
10126,Henry VI Part 3,19,1.4.165,YORK,"There, take the crown, and, with the crown, my curse,"
10127,Henry VI Part 3,19,1.4.166,YORK,And in thy need such comfort come to thee
10128,Henry VI Part 3,19,1.4.167,YORK,As now I reap at thy too cruel hand!
10129,Henry VI Part 3,19,1.4.168,YORK,"Hard-hearted Clifford, take me from the world:"
10130,Henry VI Part 3,19,1.4.169,YORK,"My soul to heaven, my blood upon your heads!"
10131,Henry VI Part 3,20,1.4.170,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Had he been slaughter-man to all my kin,"
10132,Henry VI Part 3,20,1.4.171,NORTHUMBERLAND,I should not for my life but weep with him.
10133,Henry VI Part 3,20,1.4.172,NORTHUMBERLAND,To see how inly sorrow gripes his soul.
10134,Henry VI Part 3,21,1.4.173,QUEEN MARGARET,"What, weeping-ripe, my Lord Northumberland?"
10135,Henry VI Part 3,21,1.4.174,QUEEN MARGARET,"Think but upon the wrong he did us all,"
10136,Henry VI Part 3,21,1.4.175,QUEEN MARGARET,And that will quickly dry thy melting tears.
10137,Henry VI Part 3,22,1.4.176,CLIFFORD,"Here's for my oath, here's for my father's death."
10138,Henry VI Part 3,22,,CLIFFORD,Stabbing him
10139,Henry VI Part 3,23,1.4.177,QUEEN MARGARET,And here's to right our gentle-hearted king.
10140,Henry VI Part 3,23,,QUEEN MARGARET,Stabbing him
10141,Henry VI Part 3,24,1.4.178,YORK,"Open Thy gate of mercy, gracious God!"
10142,Henry VI Part 3,24,1.4.179,YORK,My soul flies through these wounds to seek out Thee.
10143,Henry VI Part 3,24,,YORK,Dies
10144,Henry VI Part 3,25,1.4.180,QUEEN MARGARET,"Off with his head, and set it on York gates,"
10145,Henry VI Part 3,25,1.4.181,QUEEN MARGARET,So York may overlook the town of York.
10146,Henry VI Part 3,25,,QUEEN MARGARET,Flourish. Exeunt
10147,Henry VI Part 3,25,,QUEEN MARGARET,ACT II
10148,Henry VI Part 3,25,,QUEEN MARGARET,SCENE I. A plain near Mortimer's Cross in Herefordshire.
10149,Henry VI Part 3,25,,QUEEN MARGARET,"A march. Enter EDWARD, RICHARD, and their power"
10150,Henry VI Part 3,1,2.1.1,EDWARD,"I wonder how our princely father 'scaped,"
10151,Henry VI Part 3,1,2.1.2,EDWARD,Or whether he be 'scaped away or no
10152,Henry VI Part 3,1,2.1.3,EDWARD,From Clifford's and Northumberland's pursuit:
10153,Henry VI Part 3,1,2.1.4,EDWARD,"Had he been ta'en, we should have heard the news,"
10154,Henry VI Part 3,1,2.1.5,EDWARD,"Had he been slain, we should have heard the news,"
10155,Henry VI Part 3,1,2.1.6,EDWARD,"Or had he 'scaped, methinks we should have heard"
10156,Henry VI Part 3,1,2.1.7,EDWARD,The happy tidings of his good escape.
10157,Henry VI Part 3,1,2.1.8,EDWARD,How fares my brother? why is he so sad?
10158,Henry VI Part 3,2,2.1.9,RICHARD,"I cannot joy, until I be resolved"
10159,Henry VI Part 3,2,2.1.10,RICHARD,Where our right valiant father is become.
10160,Henry VI Part 3,2,2.1.11,RICHARD,"I saw him in the battle range about,"
10161,Henry VI Part 3,2,2.1.12,RICHARD,And watch'd him how he singled Clifford forth.
10162,Henry VI Part 3,2,2.1.13,RICHARD,Methought he bore him in the thickest troop
10163,Henry VI Part 3,2,2.1.14,RICHARD,"As doth a lion in a herd of neat,"
10164,Henry VI Part 3,2,2.1.15,RICHARD,"Or as a bear, encompass'd round with dogs,"
10165,Henry VI Part 3,2,2.1.16,RICHARD,"Who having pinch'd a few and made them cry,"
10166,Henry VI Part 3,2,2.1.17,RICHARD,"The rest stand all aloof, and bark at him."
10167,Henry VI Part 3,2,2.1.18,RICHARD,"So fared our father with his enemies,"
10168,Henry VI Part 3,2,2.1.19,RICHARD,So fled his enemies my warlike father:
10169,Henry VI Part 3,2,2.1.20,RICHARD,"Methinks, 'tis prize enough to be his son."
10170,Henry VI Part 3,2,2.1.21,RICHARD,"See how the morning opes her golden gates,"
10171,Henry VI Part 3,2,2.1.22,RICHARD,And takes her farewell of the glorious sun!
10172,Henry VI Part 3,2,2.1.23,RICHARD,"How well resembles it the prime of youth,"
10173,Henry VI Part 3,2,2.1.24,RICHARD,Trimm'd like a younker prancing to his love!
10174,Henry VI Part 3,3,2.1.25,EDWARD,"Dazzle mine eyes, or do I see three suns?"
10175,Henry VI Part 3,4,2.1.26,RICHARD,"Three glorious suns, each one a perfect sun,"
10176,Henry VI Part 3,4,2.1.27,RICHARD,"Not separated with the racking clouds,"
10177,Henry VI Part 3,4,2.1.28,RICHARD,But sever'd in a pale clear-shining sky.
10178,Henry VI Part 3,4,2.1.29,RICHARD,"See, see! they join, embrace, and seem to kiss,"
10179,Henry VI Part 3,4,2.1.30,RICHARD,As if they vow'd some league inviolable:
10180,Henry VI Part 3,4,2.1.31,RICHARD,"Now are they but one lamp, one light, one sun."
10181,Henry VI Part 3,4,2.1.32,RICHARD,In this the heaven figures some event.
10182,Henry VI Part 3,5,2.1.33,EDWARD,"'Tis wondrous strange, the like yet never heard of."
10183,Henry VI Part 3,5,2.1.34,EDWARD,"I think it cites us, brother, to the field,"
10184,Henry VI Part 3,5,2.1.35,EDWARD,"That we, the sons of brave Plantagenet,"
10185,Henry VI Part 3,5,2.1.36,EDWARD,"Each one already blazing by our meeds,"
10186,Henry VI Part 3,5,2.1.37,EDWARD,Should notwithstanding join our lights together
10187,Henry VI Part 3,5,2.1.38,EDWARD,And over-shine the earth as this the world.
10188,Henry VI Part 3,5,2.1.39,EDWARD,"Whate'er it bodes, henceforward will I bear"
10189,Henry VI Part 3,5,2.1.40,EDWARD,Upon my target three fair-shining suns.
10190,Henry VI Part 3,6,2.1.41,RICHARD,"Nay, bear three daughters: by your leave I speak it,"
10191,Henry VI Part 3,6,2.1.42,RICHARD,You love the breeder better than the male.
10192,Henry VI Part 3,6,,RICHARD,Enter a Messenger
10193,Henry VI Part 3,6,2.1.43,RICHARD,"But what art thou, whose heavy looks foretell"
10194,Henry VI Part 3,6,2.1.44,RICHARD,Some dreadful story hanging on thy tongue?
10195,Henry VI Part 3,7,2.1.45,Messenger,"Ah, one that was a woful looker-on"
10196,Henry VI Part 3,7,2.1.46,Messenger,"When as the noble Duke of York was slain,"
10197,Henry VI Part 3,7,2.1.47,Messenger,Your princely father and my loving lord!
10198,Henry VI Part 3,8,2.1.48,EDWARD,"O, speak no more, for I have heard too much."
10199,Henry VI Part 3,9,2.1.49,RICHARD,"Say how he died, for I will hear it all."
10200,Henry VI Part 3,10,2.1.50,Messenger,"Environed he was with many foes,"
10201,Henry VI Part 3,10,2.1.51,Messenger,"And stood against them, as the hope of Troy"
10202,Henry VI Part 3,10,2.1.52,Messenger,Against the Greeks that would have enter'd Troy.
10203,Henry VI Part 3,10,2.1.53,Messenger,"But Hercules himself must yield to odds,"
10204,Henry VI Part 3,10,2.1.54,Messenger,"And many strokes, though with a little axe,"
10205,Henry VI Part 3,10,2.1.55,Messenger,Hew down and fell the hardest-timber'd oak.
10206,Henry VI Part 3,10,2.1.56,Messenger,"By many hands your father was subdued,"
10207,Henry VI Part 3,10,2.1.57,Messenger,But only slaughter'd by the ireful arm
10208,Henry VI Part 3,10,2.1.58,Messenger,"Of unrelenting Clifford and the queen,"
10209,Henry VI Part 3,10,2.1.59,Messenger,"Who crown'd the gracious duke in high despite,"
10210,Henry VI Part 3,10,2.1.60,Messenger,"Laugh'd in his face, and when with grief he wept,"
10211,Henry VI Part 3,10,2.1.61,Messenger,The ruthless queen gave him to dry his cheeks
10212,Henry VI Part 3,10,2.1.62,Messenger,A napkin steeped in the harmless blood
10213,Henry VI Part 3,10,2.1.63,Messenger,"Of sweet young Rutland, by rough Clifford slain:"
10214,Henry VI Part 3,10,2.1.64,Messenger,"And after many scorns, many foul taunts,"
10215,Henry VI Part 3,10,2.1.65,Messenger,"They took his head, and on the gates of York"
10216,Henry VI Part 3,10,2.1.66,Messenger,"They set the same, and there it doth remain,"
10217,Henry VI Part 3,10,2.1.67,Messenger,The saddest spectacle that e'er I view'd.
10218,Henry VI Part 3,11,2.1.68,EDWARD,"Sweet Duke of York, our prop to lean upon,"
10219,Henry VI Part 3,11,2.1.69,EDWARD,"Now thou art gone, we have no staff, no stay."
10220,Henry VI Part 3,11,2.1.70,EDWARD,"O Clifford, boisterous Clifford! thou hast slain"
10221,Henry VI Part 3,11,2.1.71,EDWARD,"The flower of Europe for his chivalry,"
10222,Henry VI Part 3,11,2.1.72,EDWARD,"And treacherously hast thou vanquish'd him,"
10223,Henry VI Part 3,11,2.1.73,EDWARD,For hand to hand he would have vanquish'd thee.
10224,Henry VI Part 3,11,2.1.74,EDWARD,Now my soul's palace is become a prison:
10225,Henry VI Part 3,11,2.1.75,EDWARD,"Ah, would she break from hence, that this my body"
10226,Henry VI Part 3,11,2.1.76,EDWARD,Might in the ground be closed up in rest!
10227,Henry VI Part 3,11,2.1.77,EDWARD,"For never henceforth shall I joy again,"
10228,Henry VI Part 3,11,2.1.78,EDWARD,"Never, O never shall I see more joy!"
10229,Henry VI Part 3,12,2.1.79,RICHARD,"I cannot weep, for all my body's moisture"
10230,Henry VI Part 3,12,2.1.80,RICHARD,Scarce serves to quench my furnace-burning heart:
10231,Henry VI Part 3,12,2.1.81,RICHARD,"Nor can my tongue unload my heart's great burthen,"
10232,Henry VI Part 3,12,2.1.82,RICHARD,For selfsame wind that I should speak withal
10233,Henry VI Part 3,12,2.1.83,RICHARD,"Is kindling coals that fires all my breast,"
10234,Henry VI Part 3,12,2.1.84,RICHARD,And burns me up with flames that tears would quench.
10235,Henry VI Part 3,12,2.1.85,RICHARD,To weep is to make less the depth of grief:
10236,Henry VI Part 3,12,2.1.86,RICHARD,"Tears then for babes, blows and revenge for me"
10237,Henry VI Part 3,12,2.1.87,RICHARD,"Richard, I bear thy name, I'll venge thy death,"
10238,Henry VI Part 3,12,2.1.88,RICHARD,Or die renowned by attempting it.
10239,Henry VI Part 3,13,2.1.89,EDWARD,"His name that valiant duke hath left with thee,"
10240,Henry VI Part 3,13,2.1.90,EDWARD,His dukedom and his chair with me is left.
10241,Henry VI Part 3,14,2.1.91,RICHARD,"Nay, if thou be that princely eagle's bird,"
10242,Henry VI Part 3,14,2.1.92,RICHARD,Show thy descent by gazing 'gainst the sun:
10243,Henry VI Part 3,14,2.1.93,RICHARD,"For chair and dukedom, throne and kingdom say,"
10244,Henry VI Part 3,14,2.1.94,RICHARD,"Either that is thine, or else thou wert not his."
10245,Henry VI Part 3,14,,RICHARD,"March. Enter WARWICK, MONTAGUE, and their army"
10246,Henry VI Part 3,15,2.1.95,WARWICK,"How now, fair lords! What fare? what news abroad?"
10247,Henry VI Part 3,16,2.1.96,RICHARD,"Great Lord of Warwick, if we should recount"
10248,Henry VI Part 3,16,2.1.97,RICHARD,"Our baleful news, and at each word's deliverance"
10249,Henry VI Part 3,16,2.1.98,RICHARD,"Stab poniards in our flesh till all were told,"
10250,Henry VI Part 3,16,2.1.99,RICHARD,The words would add more anguish than the wounds.
10251,Henry VI Part 3,16,2.1.100,RICHARD,"O valiant lord, the Duke of York is slain!"
10252,Henry VI Part 3,17,2.1.101,EDWARD,"O Warwick, Warwick! that Plantagenet,"
10253,Henry VI Part 3,17,2.1.102,EDWARD,"Which held three dearly as his soul's redemption,"
10254,Henry VI Part 3,17,2.1.103,EDWARD,Is by the stern Lord Clifford done to death.
10255,Henry VI Part 3,18,2.1.104,WARWICK,"Ten days ago I drown'd these news in tears,"
10256,Henry VI Part 3,18,2.1.105,WARWICK,"And now, to add more measure to your woes,"
10257,Henry VI Part 3,18,2.1.106,WARWICK,I come to tell you things sith then befall'n.
10258,Henry VI Part 3,18,2.1.107,WARWICK,"After the bloody fray at Wakefield fought,"
10259,Henry VI Part 3,18,2.1.108,WARWICK,"Where your brave father breathed his latest gasp,"
10260,Henry VI Part 3,18,2.1.109,WARWICK,"Tidings, as swiftly as the posts could run,"
10261,Henry VI Part 3,18,2.1.110,WARWICK,Were brought me of your loss and his depart.
10262,Henry VI Part 3,18,2.1.111,WARWICK,"I, then in London keeper of the king,"
10263,Henry VI Part 3,18,2.1.112,WARWICK,"Muster'd my soldiers, gather'd flocks of friends,"
10264,Henry VI Part 3,18,2.1.113,WARWICK,"And very well appointed, as I thought,"
10265,Henry VI Part 3,18,2.1.114,WARWICK,"March'd toward Saint Alban's to intercept the queen,"
10266,Henry VI Part 3,18,2.1.115,WARWICK,"Bearing the king in my behalf along,"
10267,Henry VI Part 3,18,2.1.116,WARWICK,For by my scouts I was advertised
10268,Henry VI Part 3,18,2.1.117,WARWICK,That she was coming with a full intent
10269,Henry VI Part 3,18,2.1.118,WARWICK,To dash our late decree in parliament
10270,Henry VI Part 3,18,2.1.119,WARWICK,Touching King Henry's oath and your succession.
10271,Henry VI Part 3,18,2.1.120,WARWICK,"Short tale to make, we at Saint Alban's met"
10272,Henry VI Part 3,18,2.1.121,WARWICK,"Our battles join'd, and both sides fiercely fought:"
10273,Henry VI Part 3,18,2.1.122,WARWICK,"But whether 'twas the coldness of the king,"
10274,Henry VI Part 3,18,2.1.123,WARWICK,"Who look'd full gently on his warlike queen,"
10275,Henry VI Part 3,18,2.1.124,WARWICK,"That robb'd my soldiers of their heated spleen,"
10276,Henry VI Part 3,18,2.1.125,WARWICK,"Or whether 'twas report of her success,"
10277,Henry VI Part 3,18,2.1.126,WARWICK,"Or more than common fear of Clifford's rigour,"
10278,Henry VI Part 3,18,2.1.127,WARWICK,"Who thunders to his captives blood and death,"
10279,Henry VI Part 3,18,2.1.128,WARWICK,"I cannot judge: but to conclude with truth,"
10280,Henry VI Part 3,18,2.1.129,WARWICK,"Their weapons like to lightning came and went,"
10281,Henry VI Part 3,18,2.1.130,WARWICK,"Our soldiers', like the night-owl's lazy flight,"
10282,Henry VI Part 3,18,2.1.131,WARWICK,"Or like an idle thresher with a flail,"
10283,Henry VI Part 3,18,2.1.132,WARWICK,"Fell gently down, as if they struck their friends."
10284,Henry VI Part 3,18,2.1.133,WARWICK,"I cheer'd them up with justice of our cause,"
10285,Henry VI Part 3,18,2.1.134,WARWICK,With promise of high pay and great rewards:
10286,Henry VI Part 3,18,2.1.135,WARWICK,"But all in vain, they had no heart to fight,"
10287,Henry VI Part 3,18,2.1.136,WARWICK,"And we in them no hope to win the day,"
10288,Henry VI Part 3,18,2.1.137,WARWICK,"So that we fled, the king unto the queen,"
10289,Henry VI Part 3,18,2.1.138,WARWICK,"Lord George your brother, Norfolk and myself,"
10290,Henry VI Part 3,18,2.1.139,WARWICK,"In haste, post-haste, are come to join with you:"
10291,Henry VI Part 3,18,2.1.140,WARWICK,"For in the marches here we heard you were,"
10292,Henry VI Part 3,18,2.1.141,WARWICK,Making another head to fight again.
10293,Henry VI Part 3,19,2.1.142,EDWARD,"Where is the Duke of Norfolk, gentle Warwick?"
10294,Henry VI Part 3,19,2.1.143,EDWARD,And when came George from Burgundy to England?
10295,Henry VI Part 3,20,2.1.144,WARWICK,"Some six miles off the duke is with the soldiers,"
10296,Henry VI Part 3,20,2.1.145,WARWICK,"And for your brother, he was lately sent"
10297,Henry VI Part 3,20,2.1.146,WARWICK,"From your kind aunt, Duchess of Burgundy,"
10298,Henry VI Part 3,20,2.1.147,WARWICK,With aid of soldiers to this needful war.
10299,Henry VI Part 3,21,2.1.148,RICHARD,"'Twas odds, belike, when valiant Warwick fled:"
10300,Henry VI Part 3,21,2.1.149,RICHARD,"Oft have I heard his praises in pursuit,"
10301,Henry VI Part 3,21,2.1.150,RICHARD,But ne'er till now his scandal of retire.
10302,Henry VI Part 3,22,2.1.151,WARWICK,"Nor now my scandal, Richard, dost thou hear,"
10303,Henry VI Part 3,22,2.1.152,WARWICK,For thou shalt know this strong right hand of mine
10304,Henry VI Part 3,22,2.1.153,WARWICK,"Can pluck the diadem from faint Henry's head,"
10305,Henry VI Part 3,22,2.1.154,WARWICK,"And wring the awful sceptre from his fist,"
10306,Henry VI Part 3,22,2.1.155,WARWICK,Were he as famous and as bold in war
10307,Henry VI Part 3,22,2.1.156,WARWICK,"As he is famed for mildness, peace, and prayer."
10308,Henry VI Part 3,23,2.1.157,RICHARD,"I know it well, Lord Warwick, blame me not:"
10309,Henry VI Part 3,23,2.1.158,RICHARD,'Tis love I bear thy glories makes me speak.
10310,Henry VI Part 3,23,2.1.159,RICHARD,But in this troublous time what's to be done?
10311,Henry VI Part 3,23,2.1.160,RICHARD,"Shall we go throw away our coats of steel,"
10312,Henry VI Part 3,23,2.1.161,RICHARD,"And wrap our bodies in black mourning gowns,"
10313,Henry VI Part 3,23,2.1.162,RICHARD,Numbering our Ave-Maries with our beads?
10314,Henry VI Part 3,23,2.1.163,RICHARD,Or shall we on the helmets of our foes
10315,Henry VI Part 3,23,2.1.164,RICHARD,Tell our devotion with revengeful arms?
10316,Henry VI Part 3,23,2.1.165,RICHARD,"If for the last, say ay, and to it, lords."
10317,Henry VI Part 3,24,2.1.166,WARWICK,"Why, therefore Warwick came to seek you out,"
10318,Henry VI Part 3,24,2.1.167,WARWICK,And therefore comes my brother Montague.
10319,Henry VI Part 3,24,2.1.168,WARWICK,"Attend me, lords. The proud insulting queen,"
10320,Henry VI Part 3,24,2.1.169,WARWICK,"With Clifford and the haught Northumberland,"
10321,Henry VI Part 3,24,2.1.170,WARWICK,"And of their feather many more proud birds,"
10322,Henry VI Part 3,24,2.1.171,WARWICK,Have wrought the easy-melting king like wax.
10323,Henry VI Part 3,24,2.1.172,WARWICK,"He swore consent to your succession,"
10324,Henry VI Part 3,24,2.1.173,WARWICK,"His oath enrolled in the parliament,"
10325,Henry VI Part 3,24,2.1.174,WARWICK,"And now to London all the crew are gone,"
10326,Henry VI Part 3,24,2.1.175,WARWICK,To frustrate both his oath and what beside
10327,Henry VI Part 3,24,2.1.176,WARWICK,May make against the house of Lancaster.
10328,Henry VI Part 3,24,2.1.177,WARWICK,"Their power, I think, is thirty thousand strong:"
10329,Henry VI Part 3,24,2.1.178,WARWICK,"Now, if the help of Norfolk and myself,"
10330,Henry VI Part 3,24,2.1.179,WARWICK,"With all the friends that thou, brave Earl of March,"
10331,Henry VI Part 3,24,2.1.180,WARWICK,"Amongst the loving Welshmen canst procure,"
10332,Henry VI Part 3,24,2.1.181,WARWICK,"Will but amount to five and twenty thousand,"
10333,Henry VI Part 3,24,2.1.182,WARWICK,"Why, Via! to London will we march amain,"
10334,Henry VI Part 3,24,2.1.183,WARWICK,"And once again bestride our foaming steeds,"
10335,Henry VI Part 3,24,2.1.184,WARWICK,And once again cry 'Charge upon our foes!'
10336,Henry VI Part 3,24,2.1.185,WARWICK,But never once again turn back and fly.
10337,Henry VI Part 3,25,2.1.186,RICHARD,"Ay, now methinks I hear great Warwick speak:"
10338,Henry VI Part 3,25,2.1.187,RICHARD,"Ne'er may he live to see a sunshine day,"
10339,Henry VI Part 3,25,2.1.188,RICHARD,"That cries 'Retire,' if Warwick bid him stay."
10340,Henry VI Part 3,26,2.1.189,EDWARD,"Lord Warwick, on thy shoulder will I lean,"
10341,Henry VI Part 3,26,2.1.190,EDWARD,And when thou fail'st--as God forbid the hour!--
10342,Henry VI Part 3,26,2.1.191,EDWARD,"Must Edward fall, which peril heaven forfend!"
10343,Henry VI Part 3,27,2.1.192,WARWICK,"No longer Earl of March, but Duke of York:"
10344,Henry VI Part 3,27,2.1.193,WARWICK,"The next degree is England's royal throne,"
10345,Henry VI Part 3,27,2.1.194,WARWICK,For King of England shalt thou be proclaim'd
10346,Henry VI Part 3,27,2.1.195,WARWICK,"In every borough as we pass along,"
10347,Henry VI Part 3,27,2.1.196,WARWICK,And he that throws not up his cap for joy
10348,Henry VI Part 3,27,2.1.197,WARWICK,Shall for the fault make forfeit of his head.
10349,Henry VI Part 3,27,2.1.198,WARWICK,"King Edward, valiant Richard, Montague,"
10350,Henry VI Part 3,27,2.1.199,WARWICK,"Stay we no longer, dreaming of renown,"
10351,Henry VI Part 3,27,2.1.200,WARWICK,"But sound the trumpets, and about our task."
10352,Henry VI Part 3,28,2.1.201,RICHARD,"Then, Clifford, were thy heart as hard as steel,"
10353,Henry VI Part 3,28,2.1.202,RICHARD,"As thou hast shown it flinty by thy deeds,"
10354,Henry VI Part 3,28,2.1.203,RICHARD,"I come to pierce it, or to give thee mine."
10355,Henry VI Part 3,29,2.1.204,EDWARD,Then strike up drums: God and Saint George for us!
10356,Henry VI Part 3,29,,EDWARD,Enter a Messenger
10357,Henry VI Part 3,30,2.1.205,WARWICK,How now! what news?
10358,Henry VI Part 3,31,2.1.206,Messenger,"The Duke of Norfolk sends you word by me,"
10359,Henry VI Part 3,31,2.1.207,Messenger,"The queen is coming with a puissant host,"
10360,Henry VI Part 3,31,2.1.208,Messenger,And craves your company for speedy counsel.
10361,Henry VI Part 3,32,2.1.209,WARWICK,"Why then it sorts, brave warriors, let's away."
10362,Henry VI Part 3,32,,WARWICK,Exeunt
10363,Henry VI Part 3,32,,WARWICK,SCENE II. Before York.
10364,Henry VI Part 3,32,,WARWICK,"Flourish. Enter KING HENRY VI, QUEEN MARGARET,  PRINCE EDWARD, CLIFFORD, and NORTHUMBERLAND, with drum and trumpets"
10365,Henry VI Part 3,1,2.2.1,QUEEN MARGARET,"Welcome, my lord, to this brave town of York."
10366,Henry VI Part 3,1,2.2.2,QUEEN MARGARET,Yonder's the head of that arch-enemy
10367,Henry VI Part 3,1,2.2.3,QUEEN MARGARET,That sought to be encompass'd with your crown:
10368,Henry VI Part 3,1,2.2.4,QUEEN MARGARET,"Doth not the object cheer your heart, my lord?"
10369,Henry VI Part 3,2,2.2.5,KING HENRY VI,"Ay, as the rocks cheer them that fear their wreck:"
10370,Henry VI Part 3,2,2.2.6,KING HENRY VI,"To see this sight, it irks my very soul."
10371,Henry VI Part 3,2,2.2.7,KING HENRY VI,"Withhold revenge, dear God! 'tis not my fault,"
10372,Henry VI Part 3,2,2.2.8,KING HENRY VI,Nor wittingly have I infringed my vow.
10373,Henry VI Part 3,3,2.2.9,CLIFFORD,"My gracious liege, this too much lenity"
10374,Henry VI Part 3,3,2.2.10,CLIFFORD,And harmful pity must be laid aside.
10375,Henry VI Part 3,3,2.2.11,CLIFFORD,To whom do lions cast their gentle looks?
10376,Henry VI Part 3,3,2.2.12,CLIFFORD,Not to the beast that would usurp their den.
10377,Henry VI Part 3,3,2.2.13,CLIFFORD,Whose hand is that the forest bear doth lick?
10378,Henry VI Part 3,3,2.2.14,CLIFFORD,Not his that spoils her young before her face.
10379,Henry VI Part 3,3,2.2.15,CLIFFORD,Who 'scapes the lurking serpent's mortal sting?
10380,Henry VI Part 3,3,2.2.16,CLIFFORD,Not he that sets his foot upon her back.
10381,Henry VI Part 3,3,2.2.17,CLIFFORD,"The smallest worm will turn being trodden on,"
10382,Henry VI Part 3,3,2.2.18,CLIFFORD,And doves will peck in safeguard of their brood.
10383,Henry VI Part 3,3,2.2.19,CLIFFORD,"Ambitious York doth level at thy crown,"
10384,Henry VI Part 3,3,2.2.20,CLIFFORD,Thou smiling while he knit his angry brows:
10385,Henry VI Part 3,3,2.2.21,CLIFFORD,"He, but a duke, would have his son a king,"
10386,Henry VI Part 3,3,2.2.22,CLIFFORD,"And raise his issue, like a loving sire,"
10387,Henry VI Part 3,3,2.2.23,CLIFFORD,"Thou, being a king, blest with a goodly son,"
10388,Henry VI Part 3,3,2.2.24,CLIFFORD,"Didst yield consent to disinherit him,"
10389,Henry VI Part 3,3,2.2.25,CLIFFORD,Which argued thee a most unloving father.
10390,Henry VI Part 3,3,2.2.26,CLIFFORD,"Unreasonable creatures feed their young,"
10391,Henry VI Part 3,3,2.2.27,CLIFFORD,"And though man's face be fearful to their eyes,"
10392,Henry VI Part 3,3,2.2.28,CLIFFORD,"Yet, in protection of their tender ones,"
10393,Henry VI Part 3,3,2.2.29,CLIFFORD,"Who hath not seen them, even with those wings"
10394,Henry VI Part 3,3,2.2.30,CLIFFORD,"Which sometime they have used with fearful flight,"
10395,Henry VI Part 3,3,2.2.31,CLIFFORD,"Make war with him that climb'd unto their nest,"
10396,Henry VI Part 3,3,2.2.32,CLIFFORD,Offer their own lives in their young's defence?
10397,Henry VI Part 3,3,2.2.33,CLIFFORD,"For shame, my liege, make them your precedent!"
10398,Henry VI Part 3,3,2.2.34,CLIFFORD,Were it not pity that this goodly boy
10399,Henry VI Part 3,3,2.2.35,CLIFFORD,"Should lose his birthright by his father's fault,"
10400,Henry VI Part 3,3,2.2.36,CLIFFORD,"And long hereafter say unto his child,"
10401,Henry VI Part 3,3,2.2.37,CLIFFORD,'What my great-grandfather and his grandsire got
10402,Henry VI Part 3,3,2.2.38,CLIFFORD,My careless father fondly gave away'?
10403,Henry VI Part 3,3,2.2.39,CLIFFORD,"Ah, what a shame were this! Look on the boy,"
10404,Henry VI Part 3,3,2.2.40,CLIFFORD,"And let his manly face, which promiseth"
10405,Henry VI Part 3,3,2.2.41,CLIFFORD,"Successful fortune, steel thy melting heart"
10406,Henry VI Part 3,3,2.2.42,CLIFFORD,To hold thine own and leave thine own with him.
10407,Henry VI Part 3,4,2.2.43,KING HENRY VI,"Full well hath Clifford play'd the orator,"
10408,Henry VI Part 3,4,2.2.44,KING HENRY VI,Inferring arguments of mighty force.
10409,Henry VI Part 3,4,2.2.45,KING HENRY VI,"But, Clifford, tell me, didst thou never hear"
10410,Henry VI Part 3,4,2.2.46,KING HENRY VI,That things ill-got had ever bad success?
10411,Henry VI Part 3,4,2.2.47,KING HENRY VI,And happy always was it for that son
10412,Henry VI Part 3,4,2.2.48,KING HENRY VI,Whose father for his hoarding went to hell?
10413,Henry VI Part 3,4,2.2.49,KING HENRY VI,"I'll leave my son my virtuous deeds behind,"
10414,Henry VI Part 3,4,2.2.50,KING HENRY VI,And would my father had left me no more!
10415,Henry VI Part 3,4,2.2.51,KING HENRY VI,For all the rest is held at such a rate
10416,Henry VI Part 3,4,2.2.52,KING HENRY VI,As brings a thousand-fold more care to keep
10417,Henry VI Part 3,4,2.2.53,KING HENRY VI,Than in possession and jot of pleasure.
10418,Henry VI Part 3,4,2.2.54,KING HENRY VI,"Ah, cousin York! would thy best friends did know"
10419,Henry VI Part 3,4,2.2.55,KING HENRY VI,How it doth grieve me that thy head is here!
10420,Henry VI Part 3,5,2.2.56,QUEEN MARGARET,"My lord, cheer up your spirits: our foes are nigh,"
10421,Henry VI Part 3,5,2.2.57,QUEEN MARGARET,And this soft courage makes your followers faint.
10422,Henry VI Part 3,5,2.2.58,QUEEN MARGARET,You promised knighthood to our forward son:
10423,Henry VI Part 3,5,2.2.59,QUEEN MARGARET,"Unsheathe your sword, and dub him presently."
10424,Henry VI Part 3,5,2.2.60,QUEEN MARGARET,"Edward, kneel down."
10425,Henry VI Part 3,6,2.2.61,KING HENRY VI,"Edward Plantagenet, arise a knight,"
10426,Henry VI Part 3,6,2.2.62,KING HENRY VI,"And learn this lesson, draw thy sword in right."
10427,Henry VI Part 3,7,2.2.63,PRINCE,"My gracious father, by your kingly leave,"
10428,Henry VI Part 3,7,2.2.64,PRINCE,"I'll draw it as apparent to the crown,"
10429,Henry VI Part 3,7,2.2.65,PRINCE,And in that quarrel use it to the death.
10430,Henry VI Part 3,8,2.2.66,CLIFFORD,"Why, that is spoken like a toward prince."
10431,Henry VI Part 3,8,,CLIFFORD,Enter a Messenger
10432,Henry VI Part 3,9,2.2.67,Messenger,"Royal commanders, be in readiness:"
10433,Henry VI Part 3,9,2.2.68,Messenger,For with a band of thirty thousand men
10434,Henry VI Part 3,9,2.2.69,Messenger,"Comes Warwick, backing of the Duke of York,"
10435,Henry VI Part 3,9,2.2.70,Messenger,"And in the towns, as they do march along,"
10436,Henry VI Part 3,9,2.2.71,Messenger,"Proclaims him king, and many fly to him:"
10437,Henry VI Part 3,9,2.2.72,Messenger,"Darraign your battle, for they are at hand."
10438,Henry VI Part 3,10,2.2.73,CLIFFORD,I would your highness would depart the field:
10439,Henry VI Part 3,10,2.2.74,CLIFFORD,The queen hath best success when you are absent.
10440,Henry VI Part 3,11,2.2.75,QUEEN MARGARET,"Ay, good my lord, and leave us to our fortune."
10441,Henry VI Part 3,12,2.2.76,KING HENRY VI,"Why, that's my fortune too, therefore I'll stay."
10442,Henry VI Part 3,13,2.2.77,NORTHUMBERLAND,Be it with resolution then to fight.
10443,Henry VI Part 3,14,2.2.78,PRINCE EDWARD,"My royal father, cheer these noble lords"
10444,Henry VI Part 3,14,2.2.79,PRINCE EDWARD,And hearten those that fight in your defence:
10445,Henry VI Part 3,14,2.2.80,PRINCE EDWARD,"Unsheathe your sword, good father, cry 'Saint George!'"
10446,Henry VI Part 3,14,,PRINCE EDWARD,"March. Enter EDWARD, GEORGE, RICHARD, WARWICK, NORFOLK, MONTAGUE, and Soldiers"
10447,Henry VI Part 3,15,2.2.81,EDWARD,"Now, perjured Henry! wilt thou kneel for grace,"
10448,Henry VI Part 3,15,2.2.82,EDWARD,"And set thy diadem upon my head,"
10449,Henry VI Part 3,15,2.2.83,EDWARD,Or bide the mortal fortune of the field?
10450,Henry VI Part 3,16,2.2.84,QUEEN MARGARET,"Go, rate thy minions, proud insulting boy!"
10451,Henry VI Part 3,16,2.2.85,QUEEN MARGARET,Becomes it thee to be thus bold in terms
10452,Henry VI Part 3,16,2.2.86,QUEEN MARGARET,Before thy sovereign and thy lawful king?
10453,Henry VI Part 3,17,2.2.87,EDWARD,"I am his king, and he should bow his knee,"
10454,Henry VI Part 3,17,2.2.88,EDWARD,I was adopted heir by his consent:
10455,Henry VI Part 3,17,2.2.89,EDWARD,"Since when, his oath is broke, for, as I hear,"
10456,Henry VI Part 3,17,2.2.90,EDWARD,"You, that are king, though he do wear the crown,"
10457,Henry VI Part 3,17,2.2.91,EDWARD,"Have caused him, by new act of parliament,"
10458,Henry VI Part 3,17,2.2.92,EDWARD,"To blot out me, and put his own son in."
10459,Henry VI Part 3,18,2.2.93,CLIFFORD,And reason too:
10460,Henry VI Part 3,18,2.2.94,CLIFFORD,Who should succeed the father but the son?
10461,Henry VI Part 3,19,2.2.95,RICHARD,"Are you there, butcher? O, I cannot speak!"
10462,Henry VI Part 3,20,2.2.96,CLIFFORD,"Ay, crook-back, here I stand to answer thee,"
10463,Henry VI Part 3,20,2.2.97,CLIFFORD,Or any he the proudest of thy sort.
10464,Henry VI Part 3,21,2.2.98,RICHARD,"'Twas you that kill'd young Rutland, was it not?"
10465,Henry VI Part 3,22,2.2.99,CLIFFORD,"Ay, and old York, and yet not satisfied."
10466,Henry VI Part 3,23,2.2.100,RICHARD,"For God's sake, lords, give signal to the fight."
10467,Henry VI Part 3,24,2.2.101,WARWICK,"What say'st thou, Henry, wilt thou yield the crown?"
10468,Henry VI Part 3,25,2.2.102,QUEEN MARGARET,"Why, how now, long-tongued Warwick! dare you speak?"
10469,Henry VI Part 3,25,2.2.103,QUEEN MARGARET,"When you and I met at Saint Alban's last,"
10470,Henry VI Part 3,25,2.2.104,QUEEN MARGARET,Your legs did better service than your hands.
10471,Henry VI Part 3,26,2.2.105,WARWICK,"Then 'twas my turn to fly, and now 'tis thine."
10472,Henry VI Part 3,27,2.2.106,CLIFFORD,"You said so much before, and yet you fled."
10473,Henry VI Part 3,28,2.2.107,WARWICK,"'Twas not your valour, Clifford, drove me thence."
10474,Henry VI Part 3,29,2.2.108,NORTHUMBERLAND,"No, nor your manhood that durst make you stay."
10475,Henry VI Part 3,30,2.2.109,RICHARD,"Northumberland, I hold thee reverently."
10476,Henry VI Part 3,30,2.2.110,RICHARD,"Break off the parley, for scarce I can refrain"
10477,Henry VI Part 3,30,2.2.111,RICHARD,The execution of my big-swoln heart
10478,Henry VI Part 3,30,2.2.112,RICHARD,"Upon that Clifford, that cruel child-killer."
10479,Henry VI Part 3,31,2.2.113,CLIFFORD,"I slew thy father, call'st thou him a child?"
10480,Henry VI Part 3,32,2.2.114,RICHARD,"Ay, like a dastard and a treacherous coward,"
10481,Henry VI Part 3,32,2.2.115,RICHARD,"As thou didst kill our tender brother Rutland,"
10482,Henry VI Part 3,32,2.2.116,RICHARD,But ere sunset I'll make thee curse the deed.
10483,Henry VI Part 3,33,2.2.117,KING HENRY VI,"Have done with words, my lords, and hear me speak."
10484,Henry VI Part 3,34,2.2.118,QUEEN MARGARET,"Defy them then, or else hold close thy lips."
10485,Henry VI Part 3,35,2.2.119,KING HENRY VI,"I prithee, give no limits to my tongue:"
10486,Henry VI Part 3,35,2.2.120,KING HENRY VI,"I am a king, and privileged to speak."
10487,Henry VI Part 3,36,2.2.121,CLIFFORD,"My liege, the wound that bred this meeting here"
10488,Henry VI Part 3,36,2.2.122,CLIFFORD,"Cannot be cured by words, therefore be still."
10489,Henry VI Part 3,37,2.2.123,RICHARD,"Then, executioner, unsheathe thy sword:"
10490,Henry VI Part 3,37,2.2.124,RICHARD,"By him that made us all, I am resolved"
10491,Henry VI Part 3,37,2.2.125,RICHARD,that Clifford's manhood lies upon his tongue.
10492,Henry VI Part 3,38,2.2.126,EDWARD,"Say, Henry, shall I have my right, or no?"
10493,Henry VI Part 3,38,2.2.127,EDWARD,"A thousand men have broke their fasts to-day,"
10494,Henry VI Part 3,38,2.2.128,EDWARD,That ne'er shall dine unless thou yield the crown.
10495,Henry VI Part 3,39,2.2.129,WARWICK,"If thou deny, their blood upon thy head,"
10496,Henry VI Part 3,39,2.2.130,WARWICK,For York in justice puts his armour on.
10497,Henry VI Part 3,40,2.2.131,PRINCE EDWARD,"If that be right which Warwick says is right,"
10498,Henry VI Part 3,40,2.2.132,PRINCE EDWARD,"There is no wrong, but every thing is right."
10499,Henry VI Part 3,41,2.2.133,RICHARD,"Whoever got thee, there thy mother stands,"
10500,Henry VI Part 3,41,2.2.134,RICHARD,"For, well I wot, thou hast thy mother's tongue."
10501,Henry VI Part 3,42,2.2.135,QUEEN MARGARET,"But thou art neither like thy sire nor dam,"
10502,Henry VI Part 3,42,2.2.136,QUEEN MARGARET,"But like a foul mis-shapen stigmatic,"
10503,Henry VI Part 3,42,2.2.137,QUEEN MARGARET,"Mark'd by the destinies to be avoided,"
10504,Henry VI Part 3,42,2.2.138,QUEEN MARGARET,"As venom toads, or lizards' dreadful stings."
10505,Henry VI Part 3,43,2.2.139,RICHARD,"Iron of Naples hid with English gilt,"
10506,Henry VI Part 3,43,2.2.140,RICHARD,"Whose father bears the title of a king,--"
10507,Henry VI Part 3,43,2.2.141,RICHARD,"As if a channel should be call'd the sea,--"
10508,Henry VI Part 3,43,2.2.142,RICHARD,"Shamest thou not, knowing whence thou art extraught,"
10509,Henry VI Part 3,43,2.2.143,RICHARD,To let thy tongue detect thy base-born heart?
10510,Henry VI Part 3,44,2.2.144,EDWARD,"A wisp of straw were worth a thousand crowns,"
10511,Henry VI Part 3,44,2.2.145,EDWARD,To make this shameless callet know herself.
10512,Henry VI Part 3,44,2.2.146,EDWARD,"Helen of Greece was fairer far than thou,"
10513,Henry VI Part 3,44,2.2.147,EDWARD,"Although thy husband may be Menelaus,"
10514,Henry VI Part 3,44,2.2.148,EDWARD,And ne'er was Agamemnon's brother wrong'd

10516,Henry VI Part 3,44,2.2.150,EDWARD,"His father revell'd in the heart of France,"
10517,Henry VI Part 3,44,2.2.151,EDWARD,"And tamed the king, and made the dauphin stoop,"
10518,Henry VI Part 3,44,2.2.152,EDWARD,"And had he match'd according to his state,"
10519,Henry VI Part 3,44,2.2.153,EDWARD,"He might have kept that glory to this day,"
10520,Henry VI Part 3,44,2.2.154,EDWARD,"But when he took a beggar to his bed,"
10521,Henry VI Part 3,44,2.2.155,EDWARD,"And graced thy poor sire with his bridal-day,"
10522,Henry VI Part 3,44,2.2.156,EDWARD,"Even then that sunshine brew'd a shower for him,"
10523,Henry VI Part 3,44,2.2.157,EDWARD,"That wash'd his father's fortunes forth of France,"
10524,Henry VI Part 3,44,2.2.158,EDWARD,And heap'd sedition on his crown at home.
10525,Henry VI Part 3,44,2.2.159,EDWARD,For what hath broach'd this tumult but thy pride?
10526,Henry VI Part 3,44,2.2.160,EDWARD,"Hadst thou been meek, our title still had slept,"
10527,Henry VI Part 3,44,2.2.161,EDWARD,"And we, in pity of the gentle king,"
10528,Henry VI Part 3,44,2.2.162,EDWARD,Had slipp'd our claim until another age.
10529,Henry VI Part 3,45,2.2.163,GEORGE,"But when we saw our sunshine made thy spring,"
10530,Henry VI Part 3,45,2.2.164,GEORGE,"And that thy summer bred us no increase,"
10531,Henry VI Part 3,45,2.2.165,GEORGE,"We set the axe to thy usurping root,"
10532,Henry VI Part 3,45,2.2.166,GEORGE,"And though the edge hath something hit ourselves,"
10533,Henry VI Part 3,45,2.2.167,GEORGE,"Yet, know thou, since we have begun to strike,"
10534,Henry VI Part 3,45,2.2.168,GEORGE,"We'll never leave till we have hewn thee down,"
10535,Henry VI Part 3,45,2.2.169,GEORGE,Or bathed thy growing with our heated bloods.
10536,Henry VI Part 3,46,2.2.170,EDWARD,"And, in this resolution, I defy thee,"
10537,Henry VI Part 3,46,2.2.171,EDWARD,"Not willing any longer conference,"
10538,Henry VI Part 3,46,2.2.172,EDWARD,Since thou deniest the gentle king to speak.
10539,Henry VI Part 3,46,2.2.173,EDWARD,Sound trumpets! let our bloody colours wave!
10540,Henry VI Part 3,46,2.2.174,EDWARD,"And either victory, or else a grave."

10557,Henry VI Part 3,3,,WARWICK,Enter GEORGE
10558,Henry VI Part 3,4,2.3.10,GEORGE,"Our hap is loss, our hope but sad despair,"
10559,Henry VI Part 3,4,2.3.11,GEORGE,"Our ranks are broke, and ruin follows us:"
10560,Henry VI Part 3,4,2.3.12,GEORGE,What counsel give you? whither shall we fly?
10561,Henry VI Part 3,5,2.3.13,EDWARD,"Bootless is flight, they follow us with wings,"

10565,Henry VI Part 3,6,2.3.16,RICHARD,"Thy brother's blood the thirsty earth hath drunk,"
10566,Henry VI Part 3,6,2.3.17,RICHARD,"Broach'd with the steely point of Clifford's lance,"
10567,Henry VI Part 3,6,2.3.18,RICHARD,"And in the very pangs of death he cried,"
10568,Henry VI Part 3,6,2.3.19,RICHARD,"Like to a dismal clangour heard from far,"

10577,Henry VI Part 3,7,2.3.28,WARWICK,"And look upon, as if the tragedy"
10578,Henry VI Part 3,7,2.3.29,WARWICK,Were play'd in jest by counterfeiting actors?

10589,Henry VI Part 3,8,2.3.40,EDWARD,"That to my foes this body must be prey,"
10590,Henry VI Part 3,8,2.3.41,EDWARD,"Yet that thy brazen gates of heaven may ope,"

10596,Henry VI Part 3,9,2.3.47,RICHARD,"I, that did never weep, now melt with woe"
10597,Henry VI Part 3,9,2.3.48,RICHARD,That winter should cut off our spring-time so.
10598,Henry VI Part 3,10,2.3.49,WARWICK,"Away, away! Once more, sweet lords farewell."
10599,Henry VI Part 3,11,2.3.50,GEORGE,"Yet let us all together to our troops,"
10600,Henry VI Part 3,11,2.3.51,GEORGE,"And give them leave to fly that will not stay,"
10601,Henry VI Part 3,11,2.3.52,GEORGE,"And call them pillars that will stand to us,"
10602,Henry VI Part 3,11,2.3.53,GEORGE,"And, if we thrive, promise them such rewards"
10603,Henry VI Part 3,11,2.3.54,GEORGE,As victors wear at the Olympian games:

10612,Henry VI Part 3,1,2.4.3,RICHARD,"And this for Rutland, both bound to revenge,"
10613,Henry VI Part 3,1,2.4.4,RICHARD,Wert thou environ'd with a brazen wall.

10616,Henry VI Part 3,2,2.4.7,CLIFFORD,"And this the hand that slew thy brother Rutland,"
10617,Henry VI Part 3,2,2.4.8,CLIFFORD,And here's the heart that triumphs in their death
10618,Henry VI Part 3,2,2.4.9,CLIFFORD,And cheers these hands that slew thy sire and brother
10619,Henry VI Part 3,2,2.4.10,CLIFFORD,"To execute the like upon thyself,"

10631,Henry VI Part 3,1,2.5.5,KING HENRY VI,"Now sways it this way, like a mighty sea"
10632,Henry VI Part 3,1,2.5.6,KING HENRY VI,"Forced by the tide to combat with the wind,"
10633,Henry VI Part 3,1,2.5.7,KING HENRY VI,"Now sways it that way, like the selfsame sea"
10634,Henry VI Part 3,1,2.5.8,KING HENRY VI,Forced to retire by fury of the wind:

10636,Henry VI Part 3,1,2.5.10,KING HENRY VI,"Now one the better, then another best,"

10638,Henry VI Part 3,1,2.5.12,KING HENRY VI,Yet neither conqueror nor conquered:
10639,Henry VI Part 3,1,2.5.13,KING HENRY VI,So is the equal of this fell war.
10640,Henry VI Part 3,1,2.5.14,KING HENRY VI,Here on this molehill will I sit me down.
10641,Henry VI Part 3,1,2.5.15,KING HENRY VI,"To whom God will, there be the victory!"

10649,Henry VI Part 3,1,2.5.23,KING HENRY VI,"To sit upon a hill, as I do now,"
10650,Henry VI Part 3,1,2.5.24,KING HENRY VI,"To carve out dials quaintly, point by point,"
10651,Henry VI Part 3,1,2.5.25,KING HENRY VI,"Thereby to see the minutes how they run,"
10652,Henry VI Part 3,1,2.5.26,KING HENRY VI,"How many make the hour full complete,"
10653,Henry VI Part 3,1,2.5.27,KING HENRY VI,"How many hours bring about the day,"
10654,Henry VI Part 3,1,2.5.28,KING HENRY VI,"How many days will finish up the year,"
10655,Henry VI Part 3,1,2.5.29,KING HENRY VI,How many years a mortal man may live.
10656,Henry VI Part 3,1,2.5.30,KING HENRY VI,"When this is known, then to divide the times:"
10657,Henry VI Part 3,1,2.5.31,KING HENRY VI,"So many hours must I tend my flock,"

10669,Henry VI Part 3,1,2.5.43,KING HENRY VI,"To shepherds looking on their silly sheep,"

10671,Henry VI Part 3,1,2.5.45,KING HENRY VI,To kings that fear their subjects' treachery?
10672,Henry VI Part 3,1,2.5.46,KING HENRY VI,"O, yes, it doth, a thousand-fold it doth."

10679,Henry VI Part 3,1,2.5.53,KING HENRY VI,"His body couched in a curious bed,"
10680,Henry VI Part 3,1,2.5.54,KING HENRY VI,"When care, mistrust, and treason waits on him."

10722,Henry VI Part 3,5,2.5.94,KING HENRY VI,Woe above woe! grief more than common grief!
10723,Henry VI Part 3,5,2.5.95,KING HENRY VI,O that my death would stay these ruthful deeds!
10724,Henry VI Part 3,5,2.5.96,KING HENRY VI,"O pity, pity, gentle heaven, pity!"

10730,Henry VI Part 3,5,2.5.102,KING HENRY VI,"If you contend, a thousand lives must wither."
10731,Henry VI Part 3,6,2.5.103,Son,How will my mother for a father's death
10732,Henry VI Part 3,6,2.5.104,Son,Take on with me and ne'er be satisfied!
10733,Henry VI Part 3,7,2.5.105,Father,How will my wife for slaughter of my son
10734,Henry VI Part 3,7,2.5.106,Father,Shed seas of tears and ne'er be satisfied!
10735,Henry VI Part 3,8,2.5.107,KING HENRY VI,How will the country for these woful chances
10736,Henry VI Part 3,8,2.5.108,KING HENRY VI,Misthink the king and not be satisfied!
10737,Henry VI Part 3,9,2.5.109,Son,Was ever son so rued a father's death?
10738,Henry VI Part 3,10,2.5.110,Father,Was ever father so bemoan'd his son?
10739,Henry VI Part 3,11,2.5.111,KING HENRY VI,Was ever king so grieved for subjects' woe?
10740,Henry VI Part 3,11,2.5.112,KING HENRY VI,"Much is your sorrow, mine ten times so much."
10741,Henry VI Part 3,12,2.5.113,Son,"I'll bear thee hence, where I may weep my fill."
10742,Henry VI Part 3,12,,Son,Exit with the body
10743,Henry VI Part 3,13,2.5.114,Father,"These arms of mine shall be thy winding-sheet,"
10744,Henry VI Part 3,13,2.5.115,Father,"My heart, sweet boy, shall be thy sepulchre,"
10745,Henry VI Part 3,13,2.5.116,Father,"For from my heart thine image ne'er shall go,"
10746,Henry VI Part 3,13,2.5.117,Father,"My sighing breast shall be thy funeral bell,"
10747,Henry VI Part 3,13,2.5.118,Father,"And so obsequious will thy father be,"
10748,Henry VI Part 3,13,2.5.119,Father,"Even for the loss of thee, having no more,"
10749,Henry VI Part 3,13,2.5.120,Father,As Priam was for all his valiant sons.
10750,Henry VI Part 3,13,2.5.121,Father,"I'll bear thee hence, and let them fight that will,"
10751,Henry VI Part 3,13,2.5.122,Father,For I have murdered where I should not kill.
10752,Henry VI Part 3,13,,Father,Exit with the body
10753,Henry VI Part 3,14,2.5.123,KING HENRY VI,"Sad-hearted men, much overgone with care,"
10754,Henry VI Part 3,14,2.5.124,KING HENRY VI,Here sits a king more woful than you are.
10755,Henry VI Part 3,14,2.5.124,KING HENRY VI,"Alarums: excursions. Enter QUEEN MARGARET, PRINCE EDWARD, and EXETER"
10756,Henry VI Part 3,15,2.5.125,PRINCE EDWARD,"Fly, father, fly! for all your friends are fled,"
10757,Henry VI Part 3,15,2.5.126,PRINCE EDWARD,And Warwick rages like a chafed bull:
10758,Henry VI Part 3,15,2.5.127,PRINCE EDWARD,Away! for death doth hold us in pursuit.
10759,Henry VI Part 3,16,2.5.128,QUEEN MARGARET,"Mount you, my lord, towards Berwick post amain:"
10760,Henry VI Part 3,16,2.5.129,QUEEN MARGARET,"Edward and Richard, like a brace of greyhounds"
10761,Henry VI Part 3,16,2.5.130,QUEEN MARGARET,"Having the fearful flying hare in sight,"
10762,Henry VI Part 3,16,2.5.131,QUEEN MARGARET,"With fiery eyes sparkling for very wrath,"
10763,Henry VI Part 3,16,2.5.132,QUEEN MARGARET,"And bloody steel grasp'd in their ireful hands,"
10764,Henry VI Part 3,16,2.5.133,QUEEN MARGARET,"Are at our backs, and therefore hence amain."
10765,Henry VI Part 3,17,2.5.134,EXETER,Away! for vengeance comes along with them:
10766,Henry VI Part 3,17,2.5.135,EXETER,"Nay, stay not to expostulate, make speed,"
10767,Henry VI Part 3,17,2.5.136,EXETER,Or else come after: I'll away before.
10768,Henry VI Part 3,18,2.5.137,KING HENRY VI,"Nay, take me with thee, good sweet Exeter:"
10769,Henry VI Part 3,18,2.5.138,KING HENRY VI,"Not that I fear to stay, but love to go"
10770,Henry VI Part 3,18,2.5.139,KING HENRY VI,"Whither the queen intends. Forward, away!"
10771,Henry VI Part 3,18,,KING HENRY VI,Exeunt
10772,Henry VI Part 3,18,,KING HENRY VI,SCENE VI. Another part of the field.
10773,Henry VI Part 3,18,,KING HENRY VI,"A loud alarum. Enter CLIFFORD, wounded"
10774,Henry VI Part 3,1,2.6.1,CLIFFORD,"Here burns my candle out, ay, here it dies,"
10775,Henry VI Part 3,1,2.6.2,CLIFFORD,"Which, whiles it lasted, gave King Henry light."
10776,Henry VI Part 3,1,2.6.3,CLIFFORD,"O Lancaster, I fear thy overthrow"
10777,Henry VI Part 3,1,2.6.4,CLIFFORD,More than my body's parting with my soul!
10778,Henry VI Part 3,1,2.6.5,CLIFFORD,"My love and fear glued many friends to thee,"
10779,Henry VI Part 3,1,2.6.6,CLIFFORD,"And, now I fall, thy tough commixture melts."
10780,Henry VI Part 3,1,2.6.7,CLIFFORD,"Impairing Henry, strengthening misproud York,"
10781,Henry VI Part 3,1,2.6.8,CLIFFORD,"The common people swarm like summer flies,"
10782,Henry VI Part 3,1,2.6.9,CLIFFORD,And whither fly the gnats but to the sun?
10783,Henry VI Part 3,1,2.6.10,CLIFFORD,And who shines now but Henry's enemies?
10784,Henry VI Part 3,1,2.6.11,CLIFFORD,"O Phoebus, hadst thou never given consent"
10785,Henry VI Part 3,1,2.6.12,CLIFFORD,"That Phaethon should cheque thy fiery steeds,"
10786,Henry VI Part 3,1,2.6.13,CLIFFORD,Thy burning car never had scorch'd the earth!
10787,Henry VI Part 3,1,2.6.14,CLIFFORD,"And, Henry, hadst thou sway'd as kings should do,"
10788,Henry VI Part 3,1,2.6.15,CLIFFORD,"Or as thy father and his father did,"
10789,Henry VI Part 3,1,2.6.16,CLIFFORD,"Giving no ground unto the house of York,"
10790,Henry VI Part 3,1,2.6.17,CLIFFORD,"They never then had sprung like summer flies,"
10791,Henry VI Part 3,1,2.6.18,CLIFFORD,I and ten thousand in this luckless realm
10792,Henry VI Part 3,1,2.6.19,CLIFFORD,"Had left no mourning widows for our death,"
10793,Henry VI Part 3,1,2.6.20,CLIFFORD,And thou this day hadst kept thy chair in peace.
10794,Henry VI Part 3,1,2.6.21,CLIFFORD,For what doth cherish weeds but gentle air?
10795,Henry VI Part 3,1,2.6.22,CLIFFORD,And what makes robbers bold but too much lenity?
10796,Henry VI Part 3,1,2.6.23,CLIFFORD,"Bootless are plaints, and cureless are my wounds,"
10797,Henry VI Part 3,1,2.6.24,CLIFFORD,"No way to fly, nor strength to hold out flight:"
10798,Henry VI Part 3,1,2.6.25,CLIFFORD,"The foe is merciless, and will not pity,"
10799,Henry VI Part 3,1,2.6.26,CLIFFORD,For at their hands I have deserved no pity.
10800,Henry VI Part 3,1,2.6.27,CLIFFORD,"The air hath got into my deadly wounds,"
10801,Henry VI Part 3,1,2.6.28,CLIFFORD,And much effuse of blood doth make me faint.
10802,Henry VI Part 3,1,2.6.29,CLIFFORD,"Come, York and Richard, Warwick and the rest,"
10803,Henry VI Part 3,1,2.6.30,CLIFFORD,"I stabb'd your fathers' bosoms, split my breast."
10804,Henry VI Part 3,1,,CLIFFORD,He faints
10805,Henry VI Part 3,1,,CLIFFORD,"Alarum and retreat. Enter EDWARD, GEORGE, RICHARD, MONTAGUE, WARWICK, and Soldiers"
10806,Henry VI Part 3,2,2.6.31,EDWARD,"Now breathe we, lords: good fortune bids us pause,"
10807,Henry VI Part 3,2,2.6.32,EDWARD,And smooth the frowns of war with peaceful looks.
10808,Henry VI Part 3,2,2.6.33,EDWARD,"Some troops pursue the bloody-minded queen,"
10809,Henry VI Part 3,2,2.6.34,EDWARD,"That led calm Henry, though he were a king,"
10810,Henry VI Part 3,2,2.6.35,EDWARD,"As doth a sail, fill'd with a fretting gust,"
10811,Henry VI Part 3,2,2.6.36,EDWARD,Command an argosy to stem the waves.
10812,Henry VI Part 3,2,2.6.37,EDWARD,"But think you, lords, that Clifford fled with them?"
10813,Henry VI Part 3,3,2.6.38,WARWICK,"No, 'tis impossible he should escape,"
10814,Henry VI Part 3,3,2.6.39,WARWICK,"For, though before his face I speak the words"
10815,Henry VI Part 3,3,2.6.40,WARWICK,Your brother Richard mark'd him for the grave:
10816,Henry VI Part 3,3,2.6.41,WARWICK,"And wheresoe'er he is, he's surely dead."
10817,Henry VI Part 3,3,,WARWICK,"CLIFFORD groans, and dies"
10818,Henry VI Part 3,4,2.6.42,EDWARD,Whose soul is that which takes her heavy leave?
10819,Henry VI Part 3,5,2.6.43,RICHARD,"A deadly groan, like life and death's departing."
10820,Henry VI Part 3,6,2.6.44,EDWARD,"See who it is: and, now the battle's ended,"
10821,Henry VI Part 3,6,2.6.45,EDWARD,"If friend or foe, let him be gently used."
10822,Henry VI Part 3,7,2.6.46,RICHARD,"Revoke that doom of mercy, for 'tis Clifford,"
10823,Henry VI Part 3,7,2.6.47,RICHARD,Who not contented that he lopp'd the branch
10824,Henry VI Part 3,7,2.6.48,RICHARD,"In hewing Rutland when his leaves put forth,"
10825,Henry VI Part 3,7,2.6.49,RICHARD,But set his murdering knife unto the root
10826,Henry VI Part 3,7,2.6.50,RICHARD,"From whence that tender spray did sweetly spring,"
10827,Henry VI Part 3,7,2.6.51,RICHARD,"I mean our princely father, Duke of York."
10828,Henry VI Part 3,8,2.6.52,WARWICK,"From off the gates of York fetch down the head,"
10829,Henry VI Part 3,8,2.6.53,WARWICK,"Your father's head, which Clifford placed there,"
10830,Henry VI Part 3,8,2.6.54,WARWICK,Instead whereof let this supply the room:
10831,Henry VI Part 3,8,2.6.55,WARWICK,Measure for measure must be answered.
10832,Henry VI Part 3,9,2.6.56,EDWARD,"Bring forth that fatal screech-owl to our house,"
10833,Henry VI Part 3,9,2.6.57,EDWARD,That nothing sung but death to us and ours:
10834,Henry VI Part 3,9,2.6.58,EDWARD,"Now death shall stop his dismal threatening sound,"
10835,Henry VI Part 3,9,2.6.59,EDWARD,And his ill-boding tongue no more shall speak.
10836,Henry VI Part 3,10,2.6.60,WARWICK,I think his understanding is bereft.
10837,Henry VI Part 3,10,2.6.61,WARWICK,"Speak, Clifford, dost thou know who speaks to thee?"
10838,Henry VI Part 3,10,2.6.62,WARWICK,"Dark cloudy death o'ershades his beams of life,"
10839,Henry VI Part 3,10,2.6.63,WARWICK,And he nor sees nor hears us what we say.
10840,Henry VI Part 3,11,2.6.64,RICHARD,"O, would he did! and so perhaps he doth:"
10841,Henry VI Part 3,11,2.6.65,RICHARD,"'Tis but his policy to counterfeit,"
10842,Henry VI Part 3,11,2.6.66,RICHARD,Because he would avoid such bitter taunts
10843,Henry VI Part 3,11,2.6.67,RICHARD,Which in the time of death he gave our father.
10844,Henry VI Part 3,12,2.6.68,GEORGE,"If so thou think'st, vex him with eager words."
10845,Henry VI Part 3,13,2.6.69,RICHARD,"Clifford, ask mercy and obtain no grace."
10846,Henry VI Part 3,14,2.6.70,EDWARD,"Clifford, repent in bootless penitence."
10847,Henry VI Part 3,15,2.6.71,WARWICK,"Clifford, devise excuses for thy faults."
10848,Henry VI Part 3,16,2.6.72,GEORGE,While we devise fell tortures for thy faults.
10849,Henry VI Part 3,17,2.6.73,RICHARD,"Thou didst love York, and I am son to York."
10850,Henry VI Part 3,18,2.6.74,EDWARD,"Thou pitied'st Rutland, I will pity thee."
10851,Henry VI Part 3,19,2.6.75,GEORGE,"Where's Captain Margaret, to fence you now?"
10852,Henry VI Part 3,20,2.6.76,WARWICK,"They mock thee, Clifford: swear as thou wast wont."
10853,Henry VI Part 3,21,2.6.77,RICHARD,"What, not an oath? nay, then the world goes hard"
10854,Henry VI Part 3,21,2.6.78,RICHARD,When Clifford cannot spare his friends an oath.
10855,Henry VI Part 3,21,2.6.79,RICHARD,"I know by that he's dead, and, by my soul,"
10856,Henry VI Part 3,21,2.6.80,RICHARD,"If this right hand would buy two hour's life,"
10857,Henry VI Part 3,21,2.6.81,RICHARD,"That I in all despite might rail at him,"
10858,Henry VI Part 3,21,2.6.82,RICHARD,"This hand should chop it off, and with the"
10859,Henry VI Part 3,21,2.6.83,RICHARD,issuing blood
10860,Henry VI Part 3,21,2.6.84,RICHARD,Stifle the villain whose unstanched thirst
10861,Henry VI Part 3,21,2.6.85,RICHARD,York and young Rutland could not satisfy.
10862,Henry VI Part 3,22,2.6.86,WARWICK,"Ay, but he's dead: off with the traitor's head,"
10863,Henry VI Part 3,22,2.6.87,WARWICK,And rear it in the place your father's stands.
10864,Henry VI Part 3,22,2.6.88,WARWICK,"And now to London with triumphant march,"
10865,Henry VI Part 3,22,2.6.89,WARWICK,There to be crowned England's royal king:
10866,Henry VI Part 3,22,2.6.90,WARWICK,"From whence shall Warwick cut the sea to France,"
10867,Henry VI Part 3,22,2.6.91,WARWICK,And ask the Lady Bona for thy queen:
10868,Henry VI Part 3,22,2.6.92,WARWICK,"So shalt thou sinew both these lands together,"
10869,Henry VI Part 3,22,2.6.93,WARWICK,"And, having France thy friend, thou shalt not dread"
10870,Henry VI Part 3,22,2.6.94,WARWICK,"The scatter'd foe that hopes to rise again,"
10871,Henry VI Part 3,22,2.6.95,WARWICK,"For though they cannot greatly sting to hurt,"
10872,Henry VI Part 3,22,2.6.96,WARWICK,Yet look to have them buzz to offend thine ears.
10873,Henry VI Part 3,22,2.6.97,WARWICK,"First will I see the coronation,"
10874,Henry VI Part 3,22,2.6.98,WARWICK,"And then to Brittany I'll cross the sea,"
10875,Henry VI Part 3,22,2.6.99,WARWICK,"To effect this marriage, so it please my lord."
10876,Henry VI Part 3,23,2.6.100,EDWARD,"Even as thou wilt, sweet Warwick, let it be,"
10877,Henry VI Part 3,23,2.6.101,EDWARD,"For in thy shoulder do I build my seat,"
10878,Henry VI Part 3,23,2.6.102,EDWARD,And never will I undertake the thing
10879,Henry VI Part 3,23,2.6.103,EDWARD,Wherein thy counsel and consent is wanting.
10880,Henry VI Part 3,23,2.6.104,EDWARD,"Richard, I will create thee Duke of Gloucester,"
10881,Henry VI Part 3,23,2.6.105,EDWARD,"And George, of Clarence: Warwick, as ourself,"
10882,Henry VI Part 3,23,2.6.106,EDWARD,Shall do and undo as him pleaseth best.
10883,Henry VI Part 3,24,2.6.107,RICHARD,"Let me be Duke of Clarence, George of Gloucester,"
10884,Henry VI Part 3,24,2.6.108,RICHARD,For Gloucester's dukedom is too ominous.
10885,Henry VI Part 3,25,2.6.109,WARWICK,"Tut, that's a foolish observation:"
10886,Henry VI Part 3,25,2.6.110,WARWICK,"Richard, be Duke of Gloucester. Now to London,"
10887,Henry VI Part 3,25,2.6.111,WARWICK,To see these honours in possession.
10888,Henry VI Part 3,25,,WARWICK,Exeunt
10889,Henry VI Part 3,25,,WARWICK,ACT III
10890,Henry VI Part 3,25,,WARWICK,SCENE I. A forest in the north of England.
10891,Henry VI Part 3,25,,WARWICK,"Enter two Keepers, with cross-bows in their hands"
10892,Henry VI Part 3,1,3.1.1,First Keeper,"Under this thick-grown brake we'll shroud ourselves,"
10893,Henry VI Part 3,1,3.1.2,First Keeper,"For through this laund anon the deer will come,"
10894,Henry VI Part 3,1,3.1.3,First Keeper,"And in this covert will we make our stand,"
10895,Henry VI Part 3,1,3.1.4,First Keeper,Culling the principal of all the deer.
10896,Henry VI Part 3,2,3.1.5,Second Keeper,"I'll stay above the hill, so both may shoot."
10897,Henry VI Part 3,3,3.1.6,First Keeper,"That cannot be, the noise of thy cross-bow"
10898,Henry VI Part 3,3,3.1.7,First Keeper,"Will scare the herd, and so my shoot is lost."
10899,Henry VI Part 3,3,3.1.8,First Keeper,"Here stand we both, and aim we at the best:"
10900,Henry VI Part 3,3,3.1.9,First Keeper,"And, for the time shall not seem tedious,"
10901,Henry VI Part 3,3,3.1.10,First Keeper,I'll tell thee what befell me on a day
10902,Henry VI Part 3,3,3.1.11,First Keeper,In this self-place where now we mean to stand.
10903,Henry VI Part 3,4,3.1.12,Second Keeper,"Here comes a man, let's stay till he be past."
10904,Henry VI Part 3,4,,Second Keeper,"Enter KING HENRY VI, disguised, with a prayerbook"
10905,Henry VI Part 3,5,3.1.13,KING HENRY VI,"From Scotland am I stol'n, even of pure love,"
10906,Henry VI Part 3,5,3.1.14,KING HENRY VI,To greet mine own land with my wishful sight.
10907,Henry VI Part 3,5,3.1.15,KING HENRY VI,"No, Harry, Harry, 'tis no land of thine,"
10908,Henry VI Part 3,5,3.1.16,KING HENRY VI,"Thy place is fill'd, thy sceptre wrung from thee,"
10909,Henry VI Part 3,5,3.1.17,KING HENRY VI,Thy balm wash'd off wherewith thou wast anointed:
10910,Henry VI Part 3,5,3.1.18,KING HENRY VI,"No bending knee will call thee Caesar now,"
10911,Henry VI Part 3,5,3.1.19,KING HENRY VI,"No humble suitors press to speak for right,"
10912,Henry VI Part 3,5,3.1.20,KING HENRY VI,"No, not a man comes for redress of thee,"
10913,Henry VI Part 3,5,3.1.21,KING HENRY VI,"For how can I help them, and not myself?"
10914,Henry VI Part 3,6,3.1.22,First Keeper,"Ay, here's a deer whose skin's a keeper's fee:"
10915,Henry VI Part 3,6,3.1.23,First Keeper,"This is the quondam king, let's seize upon him."
10916,Henry VI Part 3,7,3.1.24,KING HENRY VI,"Let me embrace thee, sour adversity,"
10917,Henry VI Part 3,7,3.1.25,KING HENRY VI,For wise men say it is the wisest course.
10918,Henry VI Part 3,8,3.1.26,Second Keeper,Why linger we? let us lay hands upon him.
10919,Henry VI Part 3,9,3.1.27,First Keeper,"Forbear awhile, we'll hear a little more."
10920,Henry VI Part 3,10,3.1.28,KING HENRY VI,"My queen and son are gone to France for aid,"
10921,Henry VI Part 3,10,3.1.29,KING HENRY VI,"And, as I hear, the great commanding Warwick"
10922,Henry VI Part 3,10,3.1.30,KING HENRY VI,"Is thither gone, to crave the French king's sister"
10923,Henry VI Part 3,10,3.1.31,KING HENRY VI,"To wife for Edward: if this news be true,"
10924,Henry VI Part 3,10,3.1.32,KING HENRY VI,"Poor queen and son, your labour is but lost,"
10925,Henry VI Part 3,10,3.1.33,KING HENRY VI,"For Warwick is a subtle orator,"
10926,Henry VI Part 3,10,3.1.34,KING HENRY VI,And Lewis a prince soon won with moving words.
10927,Henry VI Part 3,10,3.1.35,KING HENRY VI,"By this account then Margaret may win him,"
10928,Henry VI Part 3,10,3.1.36,KING HENRY VI,For she's a woman to be pitied much:
10929,Henry VI Part 3,10,3.1.37,KING HENRY VI,"Her sighs will make a battery in his breast,"
10930,Henry VI Part 3,10,3.1.38,KING HENRY VI,"Her tears will pierce into a marble heart,"
10931,Henry VI Part 3,10,3.1.39,KING HENRY VI,"The tiger will be mild whiles she doth mourn,"
10932,Henry VI Part 3,10,3.1.40,KING HENRY VI,"And Nero will be tainted with remorse,"
10933,Henry VI Part 3,10,3.1.41,KING HENRY VI,"To hear and see her plaints, her brinish tears."
10934,Henry VI Part 3,10,3.1.42,KING HENRY VI,"Ay, but she's come to beg, Warwick to give,"
10935,Henry VI Part 3,10,3.1.43,KING HENRY VI,"She, on his left side, craving aid for Henry,"
10936,Henry VI Part 3,10,3.1.44,KING HENRY VI,"He, on his right, asking a wife for Edward."
10937,Henry VI Part 3,10,3.1.45,KING HENRY VI,"She weeps, and says her Henry is deposed,"
10938,Henry VI Part 3,10,3.1.46,KING HENRY VI,"He smiles, and says his Edward is install'd,"
10939,Henry VI Part 3,10,3.1.47,KING HENRY VI,"That she, poor wretch, for grief can speak no more,"
10940,Henry VI Part 3,10,3.1.48,KING HENRY VI,"Whiles Warwick tells his title, smooths the wrong,"
10941,Henry VI Part 3,10,3.1.49,KING HENRY VI,"Inferreth arguments of mighty strength,"
10942,Henry VI Part 3,10,3.1.50,KING HENRY VI,"And in conclusion wins the king from her,"
10943,Henry VI Part 3,10,3.1.51,KING HENRY VI,"With promise of his sister, and what else,"
10944,Henry VI Part 3,10,3.1.52,KING HENRY VI,To strengthen and support King Edward's place.
10945,Henry VI Part 3,10,3.1.53,KING HENRY VI,"O Margaret, thus 'twill be, and thou, poor soul,"
10946,Henry VI Part 3,10,3.1.54,KING HENRY VI,"Art then forsaken, as thou went'st forlorn!"
10947,Henry VI Part 3,11,3.1.55,Second Keeper,"Say, what art thou that talk'st of kings and queens?"
10948,Henry VI Part 3,12,3.1.56,KING HENRY VI,"More than I seem, and less than I was born to:"
10949,Henry VI Part 3,12,3.1.57,KING HENRY VI,"A man at least, for less I should not be,"
10950,Henry VI Part 3,12,3.1.58,KING HENRY VI,"And men may talk of kings, and why not I?"
10951,Henry VI Part 3,13,3.1.59,Second Keeper,"Ay, but thou talk'st as if thou wert a king."
10952,Henry VI Part 3,14,3.1.60,KING HENRY VI,"Why, so I am, in mind, and that's enough."
10953,Henry VI Part 3,15,3.1.61,Second Keeper,"But, if thou be a king, where is thy crown?"
10954,Henry VI Part 3,16,3.1.62,KING HENRY VI,"My crown is in my heart, not on my head,"
10955,Henry VI Part 3,16,3.1.63,KING HENRY VI,"Not decked with diamonds and Indian stones,"
10956,Henry VI Part 3,16,3.1.64,KING HENRY VI,Nor to be seen: my crown is called content:
10957,Henry VI Part 3,16,3.1.65,KING HENRY VI,A crown it is that seldom kings enjoy.
10958,Henry VI Part 3,17,3.1.66,Second Keeper,"Well, if you be a king crown'd with content,"
10959,Henry VI Part 3,17,3.1.67,Second Keeper,Your crown content and you must be contented
10960,Henry VI Part 3,17,3.1.68,Second Keeper,"To go along with us, for as we think,"
10961,Henry VI Part 3,17,3.1.69,Second Keeper,"You are the king King Edward hath deposed,"
10962,Henry VI Part 3,17,3.1.70,Second Keeper,And we his subjects sworn in all allegiance
10963,Henry VI Part 3,17,3.1.71,Second Keeper,Will apprehend you as his enemy.
10964,Henry VI Part 3,18,3.1.72,KING HENRY VI,"But did you never swear, and break an oath?"
10965,Henry VI Part 3,19,3.1.73,Second Keeper,"No, never such an oath, nor will not now."
10966,Henry VI Part 3,20,3.1.74,KING HENRY VI,Where did you dwell when I was King of England?
10967,Henry VI Part 3,21,3.1.75,Second Keeper,"Here in this country, where we now remain."
10968,Henry VI Part 3,22,3.1.76,KING HENRY VI,"I was anointed king at nine months old,"
10969,Henry VI Part 3,22,3.1.77,KING HENRY VI,"My father and my grandfather were kings,"
10970,Henry VI Part 3,22,3.1.78,KING HENRY VI,And you were sworn true subjects unto me:
10971,Henry VI Part 3,22,3.1.79,KING HENRY VI,"And tell me, then, have you not broke your oaths?"
10972,Henry VI Part 3,23,3.1.80,First Keeper,"No,"
10973,Henry VI Part 3,23,3.1.81,First Keeper,For we were subjects but while you were king.
10974,Henry VI Part 3,24,3.1.82,KING HENRY VI,"Why, am I dead? do I not breathe a man?"
10975,Henry VI Part 3,24,3.1.83,KING HENRY VI,"Ah, simple men, you know not what you swear!"
10976,Henry VI Part 3,24,3.1.84,KING HENRY VI,"Look, as I blow this feather from my face,"
10977,Henry VI Part 3,24,3.1.85,KING HENRY VI,"And as the air blows it to me again,"
10978,Henry VI Part 3,24,3.1.86,KING HENRY VI,"Obeying with my wind when I do blow,"
10979,Henry VI Part 3,24,3.1.87,KING HENRY VI,"And yielding to another when it blows,"
10980,Henry VI Part 3,24,3.1.88,KING HENRY VI,"Commanded always by the greater gust,"
10981,Henry VI Part 3,24,3.1.89,KING HENRY VI,Such is the lightness of you common men.
10982,Henry VI Part 3,24,3.1.90,KING HENRY VI,"But do not break your oaths, for of that sin"
10983,Henry VI Part 3,24,3.1.91,KING HENRY VI,My mild entreaty shall not make you guilty.
10984,Henry VI Part 3,24,3.1.92,KING HENRY VI,"Go where you will, the king shall be commanded,"
10985,Henry VI Part 3,24,3.1.93,KING HENRY VI,"And be you kings, command, and I'll obey."
10986,Henry VI Part 3,25,3.1.94,First Keeper,"We are true subjects to the king, King Edward."
10987,Henry VI Part 3,26,3.1.95,KING HENRY VI,"So would you be again to Henry,"
10988,Henry VI Part 3,26,3.1.96,KING HENRY VI,If he were seated as King Edward is.
10989,Henry VI Part 3,27,3.1.97,First Keeper,"We charge you, in God's name, and the king's,"
10990,Henry VI Part 3,27,3.1.98,First Keeper,To go with us unto the officers.
10991,Henry VI Part 3,28,3.1.99,KING HENRY VI,"In God's name, lead, your king's name be obey'd:"
10992,Henry VI Part 3,28,3.1.100,KING HENRY VI,"And what God will, that let your king perform,"
10993,Henry VI Part 3,28,3.1.101,KING HENRY VI,"And what he will, I humbly yield unto."
10994,Henry VI Part 3,28,,KING HENRY VI,Exeunt
10995,Henry VI Part 3,28,,KING HENRY VI,SCENE II. London. The palace.
10996,Henry VI Part 3,28,,KING HENRY VI,"Enter KING EDWARD IV, GLOUCESTER, CLARENCE, and LADY GREY"
10997,Henry VI Part 3,1,3.2.1,KING EDWARD IV,"Brother of Gloucester, at Saint Alban's field"
10998,Henry VI Part 3,1,3.2.2,KING EDWARD IV,"This lady's husband, Sir Richard Grey, was slain,"
10999,Henry VI Part 3,1,3.2.3,KING EDWARD IV,His lands then seized on by the conqueror:
11000,Henry VI Part 3,1,3.2.4,KING EDWARD IV,"Her suit is now to repossess those lands,"
11001,Henry VI Part 3,1,3.2.5,KING EDWARD IV,"Which we in justice cannot well deny,"
11002,Henry VI Part 3,1,3.2.6,KING EDWARD IV,Because in quarrel of the house of York
11003,Henry VI Part 3,1,3.2.7,KING EDWARD IV,The worthy gentleman did lose his life.
11004,Henry VI Part 3,2,3.2.8,GLOUCESTER,"Your highness shall do well to grant her suit,"
11005,Henry VI Part 3,2,3.2.9,GLOUCESTER,It were dishonour to deny it her.
11006,Henry VI Part 3,3,3.2.10,KING EDWARD IV,"It were no less, but yet I'll make a pause."
11007,Henry VI Part 3,4,3.2.11,GLOUCESTER,"[Aside to CLARENCE]  Yea, is it so?"
11008,Henry VI Part 3,4,3.2.12,GLOUCESTER,"I see the lady hath a thing to grant,"
11009,Henry VI Part 3,4,3.2.13,GLOUCESTER,Before the king will grant her humble suit.
11010,Henry VI Part 3,5,3.2.14,CLARENCE,[Aside to GLOUCESTER]  He knows the game: how true
11011,Henry VI Part 3,5,3.2.15,CLARENCE,he keeps the wind!
11012,Henry VI Part 3,6,3.2.16,GLOUCESTER,[Aside to CLARENCE]  Silence!
11013,Henry VI Part 3,7,3.2.17,KING EDWARD IV,"Widow, we will consider of your suit,"
11014,Henry VI Part 3,7,3.2.18,KING EDWARD IV,And come some other time to know our mind.
11015,Henry VI Part 3,8,3.2.19,LADY GREY,"Right gracious lord, I cannot brook delay:"
11016,Henry VI Part 3,8,3.2.20,LADY GREY,"May it please your highness to resolve me now,"
11017,Henry VI Part 3,8,3.2.21,LADY GREY,"And what your pleasure is, shall satisfy me."
11018,Henry VI Part 3,9,3.2.22,GLOUCESTER,"[Aside to CLARENCE]  Ay, widow? then I'll warrant"
11019,Henry VI Part 3,9,3.2.23,GLOUCESTER,"you all your lands,"
11020,Henry VI Part 3,9,3.2.24,GLOUCESTER,An if what pleases him shall pleasure you.
11021,Henry VI Part 3,9,3.2.25,GLOUCESTER,"Fight closer, or, good faith, you'll catch a blow."
11022,Henry VI Part 3,10,3.2.26,CLARENCE,"[Aside to GLOUCESTER]  I fear her not, unless she"
11023,Henry VI Part 3,10,3.2.27,CLARENCE,chance to fall.
11024,Henry VI Part 3,11,3.2.28,GLOUCESTER,[Aside to CLARENCE] God forbid that! for he'll
11025,Henry VI Part 3,11,3.2.29,GLOUCESTER,take vantages.
11026,Henry VI Part 3,12,3.2.30,KING EDWARD IV,"How many children hast thou, widow? tell me."
11027,Henry VI Part 3,13,3.2.31,CLARENCE,[Aside to GLOUCESTER]  I think he means to beg a
11028,Henry VI Part 3,13,3.2.32,CLARENCE,child of her.
11029,Henry VI Part 3,14,3.2.33,GLOUCESTER,"[Aside to CLARENCE]  Nay, whip me then: he'll rather"
11030,Henry VI Part 3,14,3.2.34,GLOUCESTER,give her two.
11031,Henry VI Part 3,15,3.2.35,LADY GREY,"Three, my most gracious lord."
11032,Henry VI Part 3,16,3.2.36,GLOUCESTER,"[Aside to CLARENCE]  You shall have four, if you'll"
11033,Henry VI Part 3,16,3.2.37,GLOUCESTER,be ruled by him.
11034,Henry VI Part 3,17,3.2.38,KING EDWARD IV,'Twere pity they should lose their father's lands.
11035,Henry VI Part 3,18,3.2.39,LADY GREY,"Be pitiful, dread lord, and grant it then."
11036,Henry VI Part 3,19,3.2.40,KING EDWARD IV,"Lords, give us leave: I'll try this widow's wit."
11037,Henry VI Part 3,20,3.2.41,GLOUCESTER,"[Aside to CLARENCE]  Ay, good leave have you, for"
11038,Henry VI Part 3,20,3.2.42,GLOUCESTER,"you will have leave,"
11039,Henry VI Part 3,20,3.2.43,GLOUCESTER,Till youth take leave and leave you to the crutch.
11040,Henry VI Part 3,20,,GLOUCESTER,GLOUCESTER and CLARENCE retire
11041,Henry VI Part 3,21,3.2.44,KING EDWARD IV,"Now tell me, madam, do you love your children?"
11042,Henry VI Part 3,22,3.2.45,LADY GREY,"Ay, full as dearly as I love myself."
11043,Henry VI Part 3,23,3.2.46,KING EDWARD IV,And would you not do much to do them good?
11044,Henry VI Part 3,24,3.2.47,LADY GREY,"To do them good, I would sustain some harm."
11045,Henry VI Part 3,25,3.2.48,KING EDWARD IV,"Then get your husband's lands, to do them good."
11046,Henry VI Part 3,26,3.2.49,LADY GREY,Therefore I came unto your majesty.
11047,Henry VI Part 3,27,3.2.50,KING EDWARD IV,I'll tell you how these lands are to be got.
11048,Henry VI Part 3,28,3.2.51,LADY GREY,So shall you bind me to your highness' service.
11049,Henry VI Part 3,29,3.2.52,KING EDWARD IV,"What service wilt thou do me, if I give them?"
11050,Henry VI Part 3,30,3.2.53,LADY GREY,"What you command, that rests in me to do."
11051,Henry VI Part 3,31,3.2.54,KING EDWARD IV,But you will take exceptions to my boon.
11052,Henry VI Part 3,32,3.2.55,LADY GREY,"No, gracious lord, except I cannot do it."
11053,Henry VI Part 3,33,3.2.56,KING EDWARD IV,"Ay, but thou canst do what I mean to ask."
11054,Henry VI Part 3,34,3.2.57,LADY GREY,"Why, then I will do what your grace commands."
11055,Henry VI Part 3,35,3.2.58,GLOUCESTER,"[Aside to CLARENCE]  He plies her hard, and much rain"
11056,Henry VI Part 3,35,3.2.59,GLOUCESTER,wears the marble.
11057,Henry VI Part 3,36,3.2.60,CLARENCE,"[Aside to GLOUCESTER]  As red as fire! nay, then"
11058,Henry VI Part 3,36,3.2.61,CLARENCE,her wax must melt.
11059,Henry VI Part 3,37,3.2.62,LADY GREY,"Why stops my lord, shall I not hear my task?"
11060,Henry VI Part 3,38,3.2.63,KING EDWARD IV,"An easy task, 'tis but to love a king."
11061,Henry VI Part 3,39,3.2.64,LADY GREY,"That's soon perform'd, because I am a subject."
11062,Henry VI Part 3,40,3.2.65,KING EDWARD IV,"Why, then, thy husband's lands I freely give thee."
11063,Henry VI Part 3,41,3.2.66,LADY GREY,I take my leave with many thousand thanks.
11064,Henry VI Part 3,42,3.2.67,GLOUCESTER,"[Aside to CLARENCE]  The match is made, she seals it"
11065,Henry VI Part 3,42,3.2.68,GLOUCESTER,with a curtsy.
11066,Henry VI Part 3,43,3.2.69,KING EDWARD IV,"But stay thee, 'tis the fruits of love I mean."
11067,Henry VI Part 3,44,3.2.70,LADY GREY,"The fruits of love I mean, my loving liege."
11068,Henry VI Part 3,45,3.2.71,KING EDWARD IV,"Ay, but, I fear me, in another sense."
11069,Henry VI Part 3,45,3.2.72,KING EDWARD IV,"What love, think'st thou, I sue so much to get?"
11070,Henry VI Part 3,46,3.2.73,LADY GREY,"My love till death, my humble thanks, my prayers,"
11071,Henry VI Part 3,46,3.2.74,LADY GREY,That love which virtue begs and virtue grants.
11072,Henry VI Part 3,47,3.2.75,KING EDWARD IV,"No, by my troth, I did not mean such love."
11073,Henry VI Part 3,48,3.2.76,LADY GREY,"Why, then you mean not as I thought you did."
11074,Henry VI Part 3,49,3.2.77,KING EDWARD IV,But now you partly may perceive my mind.
11075,Henry VI Part 3,50,3.2.78,LADY GREY,My mind will never grant what I perceive
11076,Henry VI Part 3,50,3.2.79,LADY GREY,"Your highness aims at, if I aim aright."
11077,Henry VI Part 3,51,3.2.80,KING EDWARD IV,"To tell thee plain, I aim to lie with thee."
11078,Henry VI Part 3,52,3.2.81,LADY GREY,"To tell you plain, I had rather lie in prison."
11079,Henry VI Part 3,53,3.2.82,KING EDWARD IV,"Why, then thou shalt not have thy husband's lands."
11080,Henry VI Part 3,54,3.2.83,LADY GREY,"Why, then mine honesty shall be my dower,"
11081,Henry VI Part 3,54,3.2.84,LADY GREY,For by that loss I will not purchase them.
11082,Henry VI Part 3,55,3.2.85,KING EDWARD IV,Therein thou wrong'st thy children mightily.
11083,Henry VI Part 3,56,3.2.86,LADY GREY,Herein your highness wrongs both them and me.
11084,Henry VI Part 3,56,3.2.87,LADY GREY,"But, mighty lord, this merry inclination"
11085,Henry VI Part 3,56,3.2.88,LADY GREY,Accords not with the sadness of my suit:
11086,Henry VI Part 3,56,3.2.89,LADY GREY,Please you dismiss me either with 'ay' or 'no.'
11087,Henry VI Part 3,57,3.2.90,KING EDWARD IV,"Ay, if thou wilt say 'ay' to my request,"
11088,Henry VI Part 3,57,3.2.91,KING EDWARD IV,No if thou dost say 'no' to my demand.
11089,Henry VI Part 3,58,3.2.92,LADY GREY,"Then, no, my lord. My suit is at an end."
11090,Henry VI Part 3,59,3.2.93,GLOUCESTER,"[Aside to CLARENCE]  The widow likes him not, she"
11091,Henry VI Part 3,59,3.2.94,GLOUCESTER,knits her brows.
11092,Henry VI Part 3,60,3.2.95,CLARENCE,[Aside to GLOUCESTER]  He is the bluntest wooer in
11093,Henry VI Part 3,60,3.2.96,CLARENCE,Christendom.
11094,Henry VI Part 3,61,3.2.97,KING EDWARD IV,"[Aside]  Her looks do argue her replete with modesty,"
11095,Henry VI Part 3,61,3.2.98,KING EDWARD IV,"Her words do show her wit incomparable,"
11096,Henry VI Part 3,61,3.2.99,KING EDWARD IV,All her perfections challenge sovereignty:
11097,Henry VI Part 3,61,3.2.100,KING EDWARD IV,"One way or other, she is for a king,"
11098,Henry VI Part 3,61,3.2.101,KING EDWARD IV,"And she shall be my love, or else my queen.--"
11099,Henry VI Part 3,61,3.2.102,KING EDWARD IV,Say that King Edward take thee for his queen?
11100,Henry VI Part 3,62,3.2.103,LADY GREY,"'Tis better said than done, my gracious lord:"
11101,Henry VI Part 3,62,3.2.104,LADY GREY,"I am a subject fit to jest withal,"
11102,Henry VI Part 3,62,3.2.105,LADY GREY,But far unfit to be a sovereign.
11103,Henry VI Part 3,63,3.2.106,KING EDWARD IV,"Sweet widow, by my state I swear to thee"
11104,Henry VI Part 3,63,3.2.107,KING EDWARD IV,"I speak no more than what my soul intends,"
11105,Henry VI Part 3,63,3.2.108,KING EDWARD IV,"And that is, to enjoy thee for my love."
11106,Henry VI Part 3,64,3.2.109,LADY GREY,And that is more than I will yield unto:
11107,Henry VI Part 3,64,3.2.110,LADY GREY,"I know I am too mean to be your queen,"
11108,Henry VI Part 3,64,3.2.111,LADY GREY,And yet too good to be your concubine.
11109,Henry VI Part 3,65,3.2.112,KING EDWARD IV,"You cavil, widow: I did mean, my queen."
11110,Henry VI Part 3,66,3.2.113,LADY GREY,'Twill grieve your grace my sons should call you father.
11111,Henry VI Part 3,67,3.2.114,KING EDWARD IV,No more than when my daughters call thee mother.
11112,Henry VI Part 3,67,3.2.115,KING EDWARD IV,"Thou art a widow, and thou hast some children,"
11113,Henry VI Part 3,67,3.2.116,KING EDWARD IV,"And, by God's mother, I, being but a bachelor,"
11114,Henry VI Part 3,67,3.2.117,KING EDWARD IV,"Have other some: why, 'tis a happy thing"
11115,Henry VI Part 3,67,3.2.118,KING EDWARD IV,To be the father unto many sons.
11116,Henry VI Part 3,67,3.2.119,KING EDWARD IV,"Answer no more, for thou shalt be my queen."
11117,Henry VI Part 3,68,3.2.120,GLOUCESTER,[Aside to CLARENCE]  The ghostly father now hath done
11118,Henry VI Part 3,68,3.2.121,GLOUCESTER,his shrift.
11119,Henry VI Part 3,69,3.2.122,CLARENCE,"[Aside to GLOUCESTER]  When he was made a shriver,"
11120,Henry VI Part 3,69,3.2.123,CLARENCE,'twas for shift.
11121,Henry VI Part 3,70,3.2.124,KING EDWARD IV,"Brothers, you muse what chat we two have had."
11122,Henry VI Part 3,71,3.2.125,GLOUCESTER,"The widow likes it not, for she looks very sad."
11123,Henry VI Part 3,72,3.2.126,KING EDWARD IV,You'll think it strange if I should marry her.
11124,Henry VI Part 3,73,3.2.127,CLARENCE,"To whom, my lord?"
11125,Henry VI Part 3,74,3.2.128,KING EDWARD IV,"Why, Clarence, to myself."
11126,Henry VI Part 3,75,3.2.129,GLOUCESTER,That would be ten days' wonder at the least.
11127,Henry VI Part 3,76,3.2.130,CLARENCE,That's a day longer than a wonder lasts.
11128,Henry VI Part 3,77,3.2.131,GLOUCESTER,By so much is the wonder in extremes.
11129,Henry VI Part 3,78,3.2.132,KING EDWARD IV,"Well, jest on, brothers: I can tell you both"
11130,Henry VI Part 3,78,3.2.133,KING EDWARD IV,Her suit is granted for her husband's lands.
11131,Henry VI Part 3,78,,KING EDWARD IV,Enter a Nobleman
11132,Henry VI Part 3,79,3.2.134,Nobleman,"My gracious lord, Henry your foe is taken,"
11133,Henry VI Part 3,79,3.2.135,Nobleman,And brought your prisoner to your palace gate.
11134,Henry VI Part 3,80,3.2.136,KING EDWARD IV,See that he be convey'd unto the Tower:
11135,Henry VI Part 3,80,3.2.137,KING EDWARD IV,"And go we, brothers, to the man that took him,"
11136,Henry VI Part 3,80,3.2.138,KING EDWARD IV,To question of his apprehension.
11137,Henry VI Part 3,80,3.2.139,KING EDWARD IV,"Widow, go you along. Lords, use her honourably."
11138,Henry VI Part 3,80,,KING EDWARD IV,Exeunt all but GLOUCESTER
11139,Henry VI Part 3,81,3.2.140,GLOUCESTER,"Ay, Edward will use women honourably."
11140,Henry VI Part 3,81,3.2.141,GLOUCESTER,"Would he were wasted, marrow, bones and all,"
11141,Henry VI Part 3,81,3.2.142,GLOUCESTER,"That from his loins no hopeful branch may spring,"
11142,Henry VI Part 3,81,3.2.143,GLOUCESTER,To cross me from the golden time I look for!
11143,Henry VI Part 3,81,3.2.144,GLOUCESTER,"And yet, between my soul's desire and me--"
11144,Henry VI Part 3,81,3.2.145,GLOUCESTER,The lustful Edward's title buried--
11145,Henry VI Part 3,81,3.2.146,GLOUCESTER,"Is Clarence, Henry, and his son young Edward,"
11146,Henry VI Part 3,81,3.2.147,GLOUCESTER,"And all the unlook'd for issue of their bodies,"
11147,Henry VI Part 3,81,3.2.148,GLOUCESTER,"To take their rooms, ere I can place myself:"
11148,Henry VI Part 3,81,3.2.149,GLOUCESTER,A cold premeditation for my purpose!
11149,Henry VI Part 3,81,3.2.150,GLOUCESTER,"Why, then, I do but dream on sovereignty,"
11150,Henry VI Part 3,81,3.2.151,GLOUCESTER,"Like one that stands upon a promontory,"
11151,Henry VI Part 3,81,3.2.152,GLOUCESTER,"And spies a far-off shore where he would tread,"
11152,Henry VI Part 3,81,3.2.153,GLOUCESTER,"Wishing his foot were equal with his eye,"
11153,Henry VI Part 3,81,3.2.154,GLOUCESTER,"And chides the sea that sunders him from thence,"
11154,Henry VI Part 3,81,3.2.155,GLOUCESTER,"Saying, he'll lade it dry to have his way:"
11155,Henry VI Part 3,81,3.2.156,GLOUCESTER,"So do I wish the crown, being so far off,"
11156,Henry VI Part 3,81,3.2.157,GLOUCESTER,"And so I chide the means that keeps me from it,"
11157,Henry VI Part 3,81,3.2.158,GLOUCESTER,"And so I say, I'll cut the causes off,"
11158,Henry VI Part 3,81,3.2.159,GLOUCESTER,Flattering me with impossibilities.
11159,Henry VI Part 3,81,3.2.160,GLOUCESTER,"My eye's too quick, my heart o'erweens too much,"
11160,Henry VI Part 3,81,3.2.161,GLOUCESTER,Unless my hand and strength could equal them.
11161,Henry VI Part 3,81,3.2.162,GLOUCESTER,"Well, say there is no kingdom then for Richard,"
11162,Henry VI Part 3,81,3.2.163,GLOUCESTER,What other pleasure can the world afford?
11163,Henry VI Part 3,81,3.2.164,GLOUCESTER,"I'll make my heaven in a lady's lap,"
11164,Henry VI Part 3,81,3.2.165,GLOUCESTER,"And deck my body in gay ornaments,"
11165,Henry VI Part 3,81,3.2.166,GLOUCESTER,And witch sweet ladies with my words and looks.
11166,Henry VI Part 3,81,3.2.167,GLOUCESTER,O miserable thought! and more unlikely
11167,Henry VI Part 3,81,3.2.168,GLOUCESTER,Than to accomplish twenty golden crowns!
11168,Henry VI Part 3,81,3.2.169,GLOUCESTER,"Why, love forswore me in my  mother's womb:"
11169,Henry VI Part 3,81,3.2.170,GLOUCESTER,"And, for I should not deal in her soft laws,"
11170,Henry VI Part 3,81,3.2.171,GLOUCESTER,"She did corrupt frail nature with some bribe,"
11171,Henry VI Part 3,81,3.2.172,GLOUCESTER,"To shrink mine arm up like a wither'd shrub,"
11172,Henry VI Part 3,81,3.2.173,GLOUCESTER,"To make an envious mountain on my back,"
11173,Henry VI Part 3,81,3.2.174,GLOUCESTER,"Where sits deformity to mock my body,"
11174,Henry VI Part 3,81,3.2.175,GLOUCESTER,"To shape my legs of an unequal size,"
11175,Henry VI Part 3,81,3.2.176,GLOUCESTER,"To disproportion me in every part,"
11176,Henry VI Part 3,81,3.2.177,GLOUCESTER,"Like to a chaos, or an unlick'd bear-whelp"
11177,Henry VI Part 3,81,3.2.178,GLOUCESTER,That carries no impression like the dam.
11178,Henry VI Part 3,81,3.2.179,GLOUCESTER,And am I then a man to be beloved?
11179,Henry VI Part 3,81,3.2.180,GLOUCESTER,"O monstrous fault, to harbour such a thought!"
11180,Henry VI Part 3,81,3.2.181,GLOUCESTER,"Then, since this earth affords no joy to me,"
11181,Henry VI Part 3,81,3.2.182,GLOUCESTER,"But to command, to cheque, to o'erbear such"
11182,Henry VI Part 3,81,3.2.183,GLOUCESTER,"As are of better person than myself,"
11183,Henry VI Part 3,81,3.2.184,GLOUCESTER,"I'll make my heaven to dream upon the crown,"
11184,Henry VI Part 3,81,3.2.185,GLOUCESTER,"And, whiles I live, to account this world but hell,"
11185,Henry VI Part 3,81,3.2.186,GLOUCESTER,Until my mis-shaped trunk that bears this head
11186,Henry VI Part 3,81,3.2.187,GLOUCESTER,Be round impaled with a glorious crown.
11187,Henry VI Part 3,81,3.2.188,GLOUCESTER,"And yet I know not how to get the crown,"
11188,Henry VI Part 3,81,3.2.189,GLOUCESTER,For many lives stand between me and home:
11189,Henry VI Part 3,81,3.2.190,GLOUCESTER,"And I,--like one lost in a thorny wood,"
11190,Henry VI Part 3,81,3.2.191,GLOUCESTER,"That rends the thorns and is rent with the thorns,"
11191,Henry VI Part 3,81,3.2.192,GLOUCESTER,"Seeking a way and straying from the way,"
11192,Henry VI Part 3,81,3.2.193,GLOUCESTER,"Not knowing how to find the open air,"
11193,Henry VI Part 3,81,3.2.194,GLOUCESTER,"But toiling desperately to find it out,--"
11194,Henry VI Part 3,81,3.2.195,GLOUCESTER,Torment myself to catch the English crown:
11195,Henry VI Part 3,81,3.2.196,GLOUCESTER,"And from that torment I will free myself,"
11196,Henry VI Part 3,81,3.2.197,GLOUCESTER,Or hew my way out with a bloody axe.
11197,Henry VI Part 3,81,3.2.198,GLOUCESTER,"Why, I can smile, and murder whiles I smile,"
11198,Henry VI Part 3,81,3.2.199,GLOUCESTER,"And cry 'Content' to that which grieves my heart,"
11199,Henry VI Part 3,81,3.2.200,GLOUCESTER,"And wet my cheeks with artificial tears,"
11200,Henry VI Part 3,81,3.2.201,GLOUCESTER,And frame my face to all occasions.
11201,Henry VI Part 3,81,3.2.202,GLOUCESTER,"I'll drown more sailors than the mermaid shall,"
11202,Henry VI Part 3,81,3.2.203,GLOUCESTER,"I'll slay more gazers than the basilisk,"
11203,Henry VI Part 3,81,3.2.204,GLOUCESTER,"I'll play the orator as well as Nestor,"
11204,Henry VI Part 3,81,3.2.205,GLOUCESTER,"Deceive more slily than Ulysses could,"
11205,Henry VI Part 3,81,3.2.206,GLOUCESTER,"And, like a Sinon, take another Troy."
11206,Henry VI Part 3,81,3.2.207,GLOUCESTER,"I can add colours to the chameleon,"
11207,Henry VI Part 3,81,3.2.208,GLOUCESTER,"Change shapes with Proteus for advantages,"
11208,Henry VI Part 3,81,3.2.209,GLOUCESTER,And set the murderous Machiavel to school.
11209,Henry VI Part 3,81,3.2.210,GLOUCESTER,"Can I do this, and cannot get a crown?"
11210,Henry VI Part 3,81,3.2.211,GLOUCESTER,"Tut, were it farther off, I'll pluck it down."
11211,Henry VI Part 3,81,,GLOUCESTER,Exit
11212,Henry VI Part 3,81,,GLOUCESTER,SCENE III. France. KING LEWIS XI's palace.
11213,Henry VI Part 3,81,,GLOUCESTER,"Flourish. Enter KING LEWIS XI, his sister BONA,  his Admiral, called BOURBON, PRINCE EDWARD, QUEEN  MARGARET, and OXFORD. KING LEWIS XI sits, and riseth up again"
11214,Henry VI Part 3,1,3.3.1,KING LEWIS XI,"Fair Queen of England, worthy Margaret,"
11215,Henry VI Part 3,1,3.3.2,KING LEWIS XI,Sit down with us: it ill befits thy state
11216,Henry VI Part 3,1,3.3.3,KING LEWIS XI,"And birth, that thou shouldst stand while Lewis doth sit."
11217,Henry VI Part 3,2,3.3.4,QUEEN MARGARET,"No, mighty King of France: now Margaret"
11218,Henry VI Part 3,2,3.3.5,QUEEN MARGARET,Must strike her sail and learn awhile to serve
11219,Henry VI Part 3,2,3.3.6,QUEEN MARGARET,"Where kings command. I was, I must confess,"
11220,Henry VI Part 3,2,3.3.7,QUEEN MARGARET,Great Albion's queen in former golden days:
11221,Henry VI Part 3,2,3.3.8,QUEEN MARGARET,"But now mischance hath trod my title down,"
11222,Henry VI Part 3,2,3.3.9,QUEEN MARGARET,"And with dishonour laid me on the ground,"
11223,Henry VI Part 3,2,3.3.10,QUEEN MARGARET,"Where I must take like seat unto my fortune,"
11224,Henry VI Part 3,2,3.3.11,QUEEN MARGARET,And to my humble seat conform myself.
11225,Henry VI Part 3,3,3.3.12,KING LEWIS XI,"Why, say, fair queen, whence springs this deep despair?"
11226,Henry VI Part 3,4,3.3.13,QUEEN MARGARET,From such a cause as fills mine eyes with tears
11227,Henry VI Part 3,4,3.3.14,QUEEN MARGARET,"And stops my tongue, while heart is drown'd in cares."
11228,Henry VI Part 3,5,3.3.15,KING LEWIS XI,"Whate'er it be, be thou still like thyself,"
11229,Henry VI Part 3,5,3.3.16,KING LEWIS XI,And sit thee by our side:
11230,Henry VI Part 3,5,,KING LEWIS XI,Seats her by him
11231,Henry VI Part 3,5,3.3.17,KING LEWIS XI,Yield not thy neck
11232,Henry VI Part 3,5,3.3.18,KING LEWIS XI,"To fortune's yoke, but let thy dauntless mind"
11233,Henry VI Part 3,5,3.3.19,KING LEWIS XI,Still ride in triumph over all mischance.
11234,Henry VI Part 3,5,3.3.20,KING LEWIS XI,"Be plain, Queen Margaret, and tell thy grief,"
11235,Henry VI Part 3,5,3.3.21,KING LEWIS XI,"It shall be eased, if France can yield relief."
11236,Henry VI Part 3,6,3.3.22,QUEEN MARGARET,Those gracious words revive my drooping thoughts
11237,Henry VI Part 3,6,3.3.23,QUEEN MARGARET,And give my tongue-tied sorrows leave to speak.
11238,Henry VI Part 3,6,3.3.24,QUEEN MARGARET,"Now, therefore, be it known to noble Lewis,"
11239,Henry VI Part 3,6,3.3.25,QUEEN MARGARET,"That Henry, sole possessor of my love,"
11240,Henry VI Part 3,6,3.3.26,QUEEN MARGARET,"Is of a king become a banish'd man,"
11241,Henry VI Part 3,6,3.3.27,QUEEN MARGARET,"And forced to live in Scotland a forlorn,"
11242,Henry VI Part 3,6,3.3.28,QUEEN MARGARET,While proud ambitious Edward Duke of York
11243,Henry VI Part 3,6,3.3.29,QUEEN MARGARET,Usurps the regal title and the seat
11244,Henry VI Part 3,6,3.3.30,QUEEN MARGARET,Of England's true-anointed lawful king.
11245,Henry VI Part 3,6,3.3.31,QUEEN MARGARET,"This is the cause that I, poor Margaret,"
11246,Henry VI Part 3,6,3.3.32,QUEEN MARGARET,"With this my son, Prince Edward, Henry's heir,"
11247,Henry VI Part 3,6,3.3.33,QUEEN MARGARET,"Am come to crave thy just and lawful aid,"
11248,Henry VI Part 3,6,3.3.34,QUEEN MARGARET,"And if thou fail us, all our hope is done:"
11249,Henry VI Part 3,6,3.3.35,QUEEN MARGARET,"Scotland hath will to help, but cannot help,"
11250,Henry VI Part 3,6,3.3.36,QUEEN MARGARET,"Our people and our peers are both misled,"
11251,Henry VI Part 3,6,3.3.37,QUEEN MARGARET,"Our treasures seized, our soldiers put to flight,"
11252,Henry VI Part 3,6,3.3.38,QUEEN MARGARET,"And, as thou seest, ourselves in heavy plight."
11253,Henry VI Part 3,7,3.3.39,KING LEWIS XI,"Renowned queen, with patience calm the storm,"
11254,Henry VI Part 3,7,3.3.40,KING LEWIS XI,While we bethink a means to break it off.
11255,Henry VI Part 3,8,3.3.41,QUEEN MARGARET,"The more we stay, the stronger grows our foe."
11256,Henry VI Part 3,9,3.3.42,KING LEWIS XI,"The more I stay, the more I'll succor thee."
11257,Henry VI Part 3,10,3.3.43,QUEEN MARGARET,"O, but impatience waiteth on true sorrow."
11258,Henry VI Part 3,10,3.3.44,QUEEN MARGARET,And see where comes the breeder of my sorrow!
11259,Henry VI Part 3,10,,QUEEN MARGARET,Enter WARWICK
11260,Henry VI Part 3,11,3.3.45,KING LEWIS XI,What's he approacheth boldly to our presence?
11261,Henry VI Part 3,12,3.3.46,QUEEN MARGARET,"Our Earl of Warwick, Edward's greatest friend."
11262,Henry VI Part 3,13,3.3.47,KING LEWIS XI,"Welcome, brave Warwick! What brings thee to France?"
11263,Henry VI Part 3,13,,KING LEWIS XI,He descends. She ariseth
11264,Henry VI Part 3,14,3.3.48,QUEEN MARGARET,"Ay, now begins a second storm to rise,"
11265,Henry VI Part 3,14,3.3.49,QUEEN MARGARET,For this is he that moves both wind and tide.
11266,Henry VI Part 3,15,3.3.50,WARWICK,"From worthy Edward, King of Albion,"
11267,Henry VI Part 3,15,3.3.51,WARWICK,"My lord and sovereign, and thy vowed friend,"
11268,Henry VI Part 3,15,3.3.52,WARWICK,"I come, in kindness and unfeigned love,"
11269,Henry VI Part 3,15,3.3.53,WARWICK,"First, to do greetings to thy royal person,"
11270,Henry VI Part 3,15,3.3.54,WARWICK,"And then to crave a league of amity,"
11271,Henry VI Part 3,15,3.3.55,WARWICK,"And lastly, to confirm that amity"
11272,Henry VI Part 3,15,3.3.56,WARWICK,"With a nuptial knot, if thou vouchsafe to grant"
11273,Henry VI Part 3,15,3.3.57,WARWICK,"That virtuous Lady Bona, thy fair sister,"
11274,Henry VI Part 3,15,3.3.58,WARWICK,To England's king in lawful marriage.
11275,Henry VI Part 3,16,3.3.59,QUEEN MARGARET,"[Aside]  If that go forward, Henry's hope is done."
11276,Henry VI Part 3,17,3.3.60,WARWICK,"[To BONA]  And, gracious madam, in our king's behalf,"
11277,Henry VI Part 3,17,3.3.61,WARWICK,"I am commanded, with your leave and favour,"
11278,Henry VI Part 3,17,3.3.62,WARWICK,"Humbly to kiss your hand, and with my tongue"
11279,Henry VI Part 3,17,3.3.63,WARWICK,"To tell the passion of my sovereign's heart,"
11280,Henry VI Part 3,17,3.3.64,WARWICK,"Where fame, late entering at his heedful ears,"
11281,Henry VI Part 3,17,3.3.65,WARWICK,Hath placed thy beauty's image and thy virtue.
11282,Henry VI Part 3,18,3.3.66,QUEEN MARGARET,"King Lewis and Lady Bona, hear me speak,"
11283,Henry VI Part 3,18,3.3.67,QUEEN MARGARET,Before you answer Warwick. His demand
11284,Henry VI Part 3,18,3.3.68,QUEEN MARGARET,"Springs not from Edward's well-meant honest love,"
11285,Henry VI Part 3,18,3.3.69,QUEEN MARGARET,"But from deceit bred by necessity,"
11286,Henry VI Part 3,18,3.3.70,QUEEN MARGARET,"For how can tyrants safely govern home,"
11287,Henry VI Part 3,18,3.3.71,QUEEN MARGARET,Unless abroad they purchase great alliance?
11288,Henry VI Part 3,18,3.3.72,QUEEN MARGARET,"To prove him tyrant this reason may suffice,"
11289,Henry VI Part 3,18,3.3.73,QUEEN MARGARET,"That Henry liveth still: but were he dead,"
11290,Henry VI Part 3,18,3.3.74,QUEEN MARGARET,"Yet here Prince Edward stands, King Henry's son."
11291,Henry VI Part 3,18,3.3.75,QUEEN MARGARET,"Look, therefore, Lewis, that by this league and marriage"
11292,Henry VI Part 3,18,3.3.76,QUEEN MARGARET,"Thou draw not on thy danger and dishonour,"
11293,Henry VI Part 3,18,3.3.77,QUEEN MARGARET,"For though usurpers sway the rule awhile,"
11294,Henry VI Part 3,18,3.3.78,QUEEN MARGARET,"Yet heavens are just, and time suppresseth wrongs."
11295,Henry VI Part 3,19,3.3.79,WARWICK,Injurious Margaret!
11296,Henry VI Part 3,20,3.3.80,PRINCE EDWARD,And why not queen?
11297,Henry VI Part 3,21,3.3.81,WARWICK,"Because thy father Henry did usurp,"
11298,Henry VI Part 3,21,3.3.82,WARWICK,And thou no more are prince than she is queen.
11299,Henry VI Part 3,22,3.3.83,OXFORD,"Then Warwick disannuls great John of Gaunt,"
11300,Henry VI Part 3,22,3.3.84,OXFORD,"Which did subdue the greatest part of Spain,"
11301,Henry VI Part 3,22,3.3.85,OXFORD,"And, after John of Gaunt, Henry the Fourth,"
11302,Henry VI Part 3,22,3.3.86,OXFORD,"Whose wisdom was a mirror to the wisest,"
11303,Henry VI Part 3,22,3.3.87,OXFORD,"And, after that wise prince, Henry the Fifth,"
11304,Henry VI Part 3,22,3.3.88,OXFORD,Who by his prowess conquered all France:
11305,Henry VI Part 3,22,3.3.89,OXFORD,From these our Henry lineally descends.
11306,Henry VI Part 3,23,3.3.90,WARWICK,"Oxford, how haps it, in this smooth discourse,"
11307,Henry VI Part 3,23,3.3.91,WARWICK,You told not how Henry the Sixth hath lost
11308,Henry VI Part 3,23,3.3.92,WARWICK,All that which Henry Fifth had gotten?
11309,Henry VI Part 3,23,3.3.93,WARWICK,Methinks these peers of France should smile at that.
11310,Henry VI Part 3,23,3.3.94,WARWICK,"But for the rest, you tell a pedigree"
11311,Henry VI Part 3,23,3.3.95,WARWICK,"Of threescore and two years, a silly time"
11312,Henry VI Part 3,23,3.3.96,WARWICK,To make prescription for a kingdom's worth.
11313,Henry VI Part 3,24,3.3.97,OXFORD,"Why, Warwick, canst thou speak against thy liege,"
11314,Henry VI Part 3,24,3.3.98,OXFORD,"Whom thou obeyed'st thirty and six years,"
11315,Henry VI Part 3,24,3.3.99,OXFORD,And not bewray thy treason with a blush?
11316,Henry VI Part 3,25,3.3.100,WARWICK,"Can Oxford, that did ever fence the right,"
11317,Henry VI Part 3,25,3.3.101,WARWICK,Now buckler falsehood with a pedigree?
11318,Henry VI Part 3,25,3.3.102,WARWICK,"For shame! leave Henry, and call Edward king."
11319,Henry VI Part 3,26,3.3.103,OXFORD,Call him my king by whose injurious doom
11320,Henry VI Part 3,26,3.3.104,OXFORD,"My elder brother, the Lord Aubrey Vere,"
11321,Henry VI Part 3,26,3.3.105,OXFORD,"Was done to death? and more than so, my father,"
11322,Henry VI Part 3,26,3.3.106,OXFORD,"Even in the downfall of his mellow'd years,"
11323,Henry VI Part 3,26,3.3.107,OXFORD,When nature brought him to the door of death?
11324,Henry VI Part 3,26,3.3.108,OXFORD,"No, Warwick, no, while life upholds this arm,"
11325,Henry VI Part 3,26,3.3.109,OXFORD,This arm upholds the house of Lancaster.
11326,Henry VI Part 3,27,3.3.110,WARWICK,And I the house of York.
11327,Henry VI Part 3,28,3.3.111,KING LEWIS XI,"Queen Margaret, Prince Edward, and Oxford,"
11328,Henry VI Part 3,28,3.3.112,KING LEWIS XI,"Vouchsafe, at our request, to stand aside,"
11329,Henry VI Part 3,28,3.3.113,KING LEWIS XI,While I use further conference with Warwick.
11330,Henry VI Part 3,28,,KING LEWIS XI,They stand aloof
11331,Henry VI Part 3,29,3.3.114,QUEEN MARGARET,Heavens grant that Warwick's words bewitch him not!
11332,Henry VI Part 3,30,3.3.115,KING LEWIS XI,"Now Warwick, tell me, even upon thy conscience,"
11333,Henry VI Part 3,30,3.3.116,KING LEWIS XI,Is Edward your true king? for I were loath
11334,Henry VI Part 3,30,3.3.117,KING LEWIS XI,To link with him that were not lawful chosen.
11335,Henry VI Part 3,31,3.3.118,WARWICK,Thereon I pawn my credit and mine honour.
11336,Henry VI Part 3,32,3.3.119,KING LEWIS XI,But is he gracious in the people's eye?
11337,Henry VI Part 3,33,3.3.120,WARWICK,The more that Henry was unfortunate.
11338,Henry VI Part 3,34,3.3.121,KING LEWIS XI,"Then further, all dissembling set aside,"
11339,Henry VI Part 3,34,3.3.122,KING LEWIS XI,Tell me for truth the measure of his love
11340,Henry VI Part 3,34,3.3.123,KING LEWIS XI,Unto our sister Bona.
11341,Henry VI Part 3,35,3.3.124,WARWICK,Such it seems
11342,Henry VI Part 3,35,3.3.125,WARWICK,As may beseem a monarch like himself.
11343,Henry VI Part 3,35,3.3.126,WARWICK,Myself have often heard him say and swear
11344,Henry VI Part 3,35,3.3.127,WARWICK,"That this his love was an eternal plant,"
11345,Henry VI Part 3,35,3.3.128,WARWICK,"Whereof the root was fix'd in virtue's ground,"
11346,Henry VI Part 3,35,3.3.129,WARWICK,"The leaves and fruit maintain'd with beauty's sun,"
11347,Henry VI Part 3,35,3.3.130,WARWICK,"Exempt from envy, but not from disdain,"
11348,Henry VI Part 3,35,3.3.131,WARWICK,Unless the Lady Bona quit his pain.
11349,Henry VI Part 3,36,3.3.132,KING LEWIS XI,"Now, sister, let us hear your firm resolve."
11350,Henry VI Part 3,37,3.3.133,BONA,"Your grant, or your denial, shall be mine:"
11351,Henry VI Part 3,37,,BONA,To WARWICK
11352,Henry VI Part 3,37,3.3.134,BONA,"Yet I confess that often ere this day,"
11353,Henry VI Part 3,37,3.3.135,BONA,"When I have heard your king's desert recounted,"
11354,Henry VI Part 3,37,3.3.136,BONA,Mine ear hath tempted judgment to desire.
11355,Henry VI Part 3,38,3.3.137,KING LEWIS XI,"Then, Warwick, thus: our sister shall be Edward's,"
11356,Henry VI Part 3,38,3.3.138,KING LEWIS XI,And now forthwith shall articles be drawn
11357,Henry VI Part 3,38,3.3.139,KING LEWIS XI,"Touching the jointure that your king must make,"
11358,Henry VI Part 3,38,3.3.140,KING LEWIS XI,Which with her dowry shall be counterpoised.
11359,Henry VI Part 3,38,3.3.141,KING LEWIS XI,"Draw near, Queen Margaret, and be a witness"
11360,Henry VI Part 3,38,3.3.142,KING LEWIS XI,That Bona shall be wife to the English king.
11361,Henry VI Part 3,39,3.3.143,PRINCE EDWARD,"To Edward, but not to the English king."
11362,Henry VI Part 3,40,3.3.144,QUEEN MARGARET,Deceitful Warwick! it was thy device
11363,Henry VI Part 3,40,3.3.145,QUEEN MARGARET,By this alliance to make void my suit:
11364,Henry VI Part 3,40,3.3.146,QUEEN MARGARET,Before thy coming Lewis was Henry's friend.
11365,Henry VI Part 3,41,3.3.147,KING LEWIS XI,And still is friend to him and Margaret:
11366,Henry VI Part 3,41,3.3.148,KING LEWIS XI,"But if your title to the crown be weak,"
11367,Henry VI Part 3,41,3.3.149,KING LEWIS XI,"As may appear by Edward's good success,"
11368,Henry VI Part 3,41,3.3.150,KING LEWIS XI,Then 'tis but reason that I be released
11369,Henry VI Part 3,41,3.3.151,KING LEWIS XI,From giving aid which late I promised.
11370,Henry VI Part 3,41,3.3.152,KING LEWIS XI,Yet shall you have all kindness at my hand
11371,Henry VI Part 3,41,3.3.153,KING LEWIS XI,That your estate requires and mine can yield.
11372,Henry VI Part 3,42,3.3.154,WARWICK,"Henry now lives in Scotland at his ease,"
11373,Henry VI Part 3,42,3.3.155,WARWICK,"Where having nothing, nothing can he lose."
11374,Henry VI Part 3,42,3.3.156,WARWICK,"And as for you yourself, our quondam queen,"
11375,Henry VI Part 3,42,3.3.157,WARWICK,"You have a father able to maintain you,"
11376,Henry VI Part 3,42,3.3.158,WARWICK,And better 'twere you troubled him than France.
11377,Henry VI Part 3,43,3.3.159,QUEEN MARGARET,"Peace, impudent and shameless Warwick, peace,"
11378,Henry VI Part 3,43,3.3.160,QUEEN MARGARET,Proud setter up and puller down of kings!
11379,Henry VI Part 3,43,3.3.161,QUEEN MARGARET,"I will not hence, till, with my talk and tears,"
11380,Henry VI Part 3,43,3.3.162,QUEEN MARGARET,"Both full of truth, I make King Lewis behold"
11381,Henry VI Part 3,43,3.3.163,QUEEN MARGARET,"Thy sly conveyance and thy lord's false love,"
11382,Henry VI Part 3,43,3.3.164,QUEEN MARGARET,For both of you are birds of selfsame feather.
11383,Henry VI Part 3,43,,QUEEN MARGARET,Post blows a horn within
11384,Henry VI Part 3,44,3.3.165,KING LEWIS XI,"Warwick, this is some post to us or thee."
11385,Henry VI Part 3,44,,KING LEWIS XI,Enter a Post
11386,Henry VI Part 3,45,3.3.166,Post,"[To WARWICK]  My lord ambassador, these letters are for you,"
11387,Henry VI Part 3,45,3.3.167,Post,"Sent from your brother, Marquess Montague:"
11388,Henry VI Part 3,45,,Post,To KING LEWIS XI
11389,Henry VI Part 3,45,3.3.168,Post,These from our king unto your majesty:
11390,Henry VI Part 3,45,,Post,To QUEEN MARGARET
11391,Henry VI Part 3,45,3.3.169,Post,"And, madam, these for you, from whom I know not."
11392,Henry VI Part 3,45,,Post,They all read their letters
11393,Henry VI Part 3,46,3.3.170,OXFORD,I like it well that our fair queen and mistress
11394,Henry VI Part 3,46,3.3.171,OXFORD,"Smiles at her news, while Warwick frowns at his."
11395,Henry VI Part 3,47,3.3.172,PRINCE EDWARD,"Nay, mark how Lewis stamps, as he were nettled:"
11396,Henry VI Part 3,47,3.3.173,PRINCE EDWARD,I hope all's for the best.
11397,Henry VI Part 3,48,3.3.174,KING LEWIS XI,"Warwick, what are thy news? and yours, fair queen?"
11398,Henry VI Part 3,49,3.3.175,QUEEN MARGARET,"Mine, such as fill my heart with unhoped joys."
11399,Henry VI Part 3,50,3.3.176,WARWICK,"Mine, full of sorrow and heart's discontent."
11400,Henry VI Part 3,51,3.3.177,KING LEWIS XI,What! has your king married the Lady Grey!
11401,Henry VI Part 3,51,3.3.178,KING LEWIS XI,"And now, to soothe your forgery and his,"
11402,Henry VI Part 3,51,3.3.179,KING LEWIS XI,Sends me a paper to persuade me patience?
11403,Henry VI Part 3,51,3.3.180,KING LEWIS XI,Is this the alliance that he seeks with France?
11404,Henry VI Part 3,51,3.3.181,KING LEWIS XI,Dare he presume to scorn us in this manner?
11405,Henry VI Part 3,52,3.3.182,QUEEN MARGARET,I told your majesty as much before:
11406,Henry VI Part 3,52,3.3.183,QUEEN MARGARET,This proveth Edward's love and Warwick's honesty.
11407,Henry VI Part 3,53,3.3.184,WARWICK,"King Lewis, I here protest, in sight of heaven,"
11408,Henry VI Part 3,53,3.3.185,WARWICK,"And by the hope I have of heavenly bliss,"
11409,Henry VI Part 3,53,3.3.186,WARWICK,"That I am clear from this misdeed of Edward's,"
11410,Henry VI Part 3,53,3.3.187,WARWICK,"No more my king, for he dishonours me,"
11411,Henry VI Part 3,53,3.3.188,WARWICK,"But most himself, if he could see his shame."
11412,Henry VI Part 3,53,3.3.189,WARWICK,Did I forget that by the house of York
11413,Henry VI Part 3,53,3.3.190,WARWICK,My father came untimely to his death?
11414,Henry VI Part 3,53,3.3.191,WARWICK,Did I let pass the abuse done to my niece?
11415,Henry VI Part 3,53,3.3.192,WARWICK,Did I impale him with the regal crown?
11416,Henry VI Part 3,53,3.3.193,WARWICK,Did I put Henry from his native right?
11417,Henry VI Part 3,53,3.3.194,WARWICK,And am I guerdon'd at the last with shame?
11418,Henry VI Part 3,53,3.3.195,WARWICK,Shame on himself! for my desert is honour:
11419,Henry VI Part 3,53,3.3.196,WARWICK,"And to repair my honour lost for him,"
11420,Henry VI Part 3,53,3.3.197,WARWICK,I here renounce him and return to Henry.
11421,Henry VI Part 3,53,3.3.198,WARWICK,"My noble queen, let former grudges pass,"
11422,Henry VI Part 3,53,3.3.199,WARWICK,And henceforth I am thy true servitor:
11423,Henry VI Part 3,53,3.3.200,WARWICK,"I will revenge his wrong to Lady Bona,"
11424,Henry VI Part 3,53,3.3.201,WARWICK,And replant Henry in his former state.
11425,Henry VI Part 3,54,3.3.202,QUEEN MARGARET,"Warwick, these words have turn'd my hate to love,"
11426,Henry VI Part 3,54,3.3.203,QUEEN MARGARET,"And I forgive and quite forget old faults,"
11427,Henry VI Part 3,54,3.3.204,QUEEN MARGARET,And joy that thou becomest King Henry's friend.
11428,Henry VI Part 3,55,3.3.205,WARWICK,"So much his friend, ay, his unfeigned friend,"
11429,Henry VI Part 3,55,3.3.206,WARWICK,"That, if King Lewis vouchsafe to furnish us"
11430,Henry VI Part 3,55,3.3.207,WARWICK,"With some few bands of chosen soldiers,"
11431,Henry VI Part 3,55,3.3.208,WARWICK,I'll undertake to land them on our coast
11432,Henry VI Part 3,55,3.3.209,WARWICK,And force the tyrant from his seat by war.
11433,Henry VI Part 3,55,3.3.210,WARWICK,'Tis not his new-made bride shall succor him:
11434,Henry VI Part 3,55,3.3.211,WARWICK,"And as for Clarence, as my letters tell me,"
11435,Henry VI Part 3,55,3.3.212,WARWICK,"He's very likely now to fall from him,"
11436,Henry VI Part 3,55,3.3.213,WARWICK,"For matching more for wanton lust than honour,"
11437,Henry VI Part 3,55,3.3.214,WARWICK,Or than for strength and safety of our country.
11438,Henry VI Part 3,56,3.3.215,BONA,"Dear brother, how shall Bona be revenged"
11439,Henry VI Part 3,56,3.3.216,BONA,But by thy help to this distressed queen?
11440,Henry VI Part 3,57,3.3.217,QUEEN MARGARET,"Renowned prince, how shall poor Henry live,"
11441,Henry VI Part 3,57,3.3.218,QUEEN MARGARET,Unless thou rescue him from foul despair?
11442,Henry VI Part 3,58,3.3.219,BONA,My quarrel and this English queen's are one.
11443,Henry VI Part 3,59,3.3.220,WARWICK,"And mine, fair lady Bona, joins with yours."
11444,Henry VI Part 3,60,3.3.221,KING LEWIS XI,"And mine with hers, and thine, and Margaret's."
11445,Henry VI Part 3,60,3.3.222,KING LEWIS XI,Therefore at last I firmly am resolved
11446,Henry VI Part 3,60,3.3.223,KING LEWIS XI,You shall have aid.
11447,Henry VI Part 3,61,3.3.224,QUEEN MARGARET,Let me give humble thanks for all at once.
11448,Henry VI Part 3,62,3.3.225,KING LEWIS XI,"Then, England's messenger, return in post,"
11449,Henry VI Part 3,62,3.3.226,KING LEWIS XI,"And tell false Edward, thy supposed king,"
11450,Henry VI Part 3,62,3.3.227,KING LEWIS XI,That Lewis of France is sending over masquers
11451,Henry VI Part 3,62,3.3.228,KING LEWIS XI,To revel it with him and his new bride:
11452,Henry VI Part 3,62,3.3.229,KING LEWIS XI,"Thou seest what's past, go fear thy king withal."
11453,Henry VI Part 3,63,3.3.230,BONA,"Tell him, in hope he'll prove a widower shortly,"
11454,Henry VI Part 3,63,3.3.231,BONA,I'll wear the willow garland for his sake.
11455,Henry VI Part 3,64,3.3.232,QUEEN MARGARET,"Tell him, my mourning weeds are laid aside,"
11456,Henry VI Part 3,64,3.3.233,QUEEN MARGARET,And I am ready to put armour on.
11457,Henry VI Part 3,65,3.3.234,WARWICK,"Tell him from me that he hath done me wrong,"
11458,Henry VI Part 3,65,3.3.235,WARWICK,And therefore I'll uncrown him ere't be long.
11459,Henry VI Part 3,65,3.3.236,WARWICK,There's thy reward: be gone.
11460,Henry VI Part 3,65,,WARWICK,Exit Post
11461,Henry VI Part 3,66,3.3.237,KING LEWIS XI,"But, Warwick,"
11462,Henry VI Part 3,66,3.3.238,KING LEWIS XI,"Thou and Oxford, with five thousand men,"
11463,Henry VI Part 3,66,3.3.239,KING LEWIS XI,"Shall cross the seas, and bid false Edward battle,"
11464,Henry VI Part 3,66,3.3.240,KING LEWIS XI,"And, as occasion serves, this noble queen"
11465,Henry VI Part 3,66,3.3.241,KING LEWIS XI,And prince shall follow with a fresh supply.
11466,Henry VI Part 3,66,3.3.242,KING LEWIS XI,"Yet, ere thou go, but answer me one doubt,"
11467,Henry VI Part 3,66,3.3.243,KING LEWIS XI,What pledge have we of thy firm loyalty?
11468,Henry VI Part 3,67,3.3.244,WARWICK,"This shall assure my constant loyalty,"
11469,Henry VI Part 3,67,3.3.245,WARWICK,"That if our queen and this young prince agree,"
11470,Henry VI Part 3,67,3.3.246,WARWICK,I'll join mine eldest daughter and my joy
11471,Henry VI Part 3,67,3.3.247,WARWICK,To him forthwith in holy wedlock bands.
11472,Henry VI Part 3,68,3.3.248,QUEEN MARGARET,"Yes, I agree, and thank you for your motion."
11473,Henry VI Part 3,68,3.3.249,QUEEN MARGARET,"Son Edward, she is fair and virtuous,"
11474,Henry VI Part 3,68,3.3.250,QUEEN MARGARET,"Therefore delay not, give thy hand to Warwick,"
11475,Henry VI Part 3,68,3.3.251,QUEEN MARGARET,"And, with thy hand, thy faith irrevocable,"
11476,Henry VI Part 3,68,3.3.252,QUEEN MARGARET,That only Warwick's daughter shall be thine.
11477,Henry VI Part 3,69,3.3.253,PRINCE EDWARD,"Yes, I accept her, for she well deserves it,"
11478,Henry VI Part 3,69,3.3.254,PRINCE EDWARD,"And here, to pledge my vow, I give my hand."
11479,Henry VI Part 3,69,,PRINCE EDWARD,He gives his hand to WARWICK
11480,Henry VI Part 3,70,3.3.255,KING LEWIS XI,"Why stay we now? These soldiers shall be levied,"
11481,Henry VI Part 3,70,3.3.256,KING LEWIS XI,"And thou, Lord Bourbon, our high admiral,"
11482,Henry VI Part 3,70,3.3.257,KING LEWIS XI,Shalt waft them over with our royal fleet.
11483,Henry VI Part 3,70,3.3.258,KING LEWIS XI,"I long till Edward fall by war's mischance,"
11484,Henry VI Part 3,70,3.3.259,KING LEWIS XI,For mocking marriage with a dame of France.
11485,Henry VI Part 3,70,,KING LEWIS XI,Exeunt all but WARWICK
11486,Henry VI Part 3,71,3.3.260,WARWICK,"I came from Edward as ambassador,"
11487,Henry VI Part 3,71,3.3.261,WARWICK,But I return his sworn and mortal foe:
11488,Henry VI Part 3,71,3.3.262,WARWICK,"Matter of marriage was the charge he gave me,"
11489,Henry VI Part 3,71,3.3.263,WARWICK,But dreadful war shall answer his demand.
11490,Henry VI Part 3,71,3.3.264,WARWICK,Had he none else to make a stale but me?
11491,Henry VI Part 3,71,3.3.265,WARWICK,Then none but I shall turn his jest to sorrow.
11492,Henry VI Part 3,71,3.3.266,WARWICK,"I was the chief that raised him to the crown,"
11493,Henry VI Part 3,71,3.3.267,WARWICK,And I'll be chief to bring him down again:
11494,Henry VI Part 3,71,3.3.268,WARWICK,"Not that I pity Henry's misery,"
11495,Henry VI Part 3,71,3.3.269,WARWICK,But seek revenge on Edward's mockery.
11496,Henry VI Part 3,71,,WARWICK,Exit
11497,Henry VI Part 3,71,,WARWICK,ACT IV
11498,Henry VI Part 3,71,,WARWICK,SCENE I. London. The palace.
11499,Henry VI Part 3,71,,WARWICK,"Enter GLOUCESTER, CLARENCE, SOMERSET, and MONTAGUE"
11500,Henry VI Part 3,1,4.1.1,GLOUCESTER,"Now tell me, brother Clarence, what think you"
11501,Henry VI Part 3,1,4.1.2,GLOUCESTER,Of this new marriage with the Lady Grey?
11502,Henry VI Part 3,1,4.1.3,GLOUCESTER,Hath not our brother made a worthy choice?
11503,Henry VI Part 3,2,4.1.4,CLARENCE,"Alas, you know, 'tis far from hence to France,"
11504,Henry VI Part 3,2,4.1.5,CLARENCE,How could he stay till Warwick made return?
11505,Henry VI Part 3,3,4.1.6,SOMERSET,"My lords, forbear this talk, here comes the king."
11506,Henry VI Part 3,4,4.1.7,GLOUCESTER,And his well-chosen bride.
11507,Henry VI Part 3,5,4.1.8,CLARENCE,I mind to tell him plainly what I think.
11508,Henry VI Part 3,5,4.1.8,CLARENCE,"Flourish. Enter KING EDWARD IV, attended, QUEEN ELIZABETH, PEMBROKE, STAFFORD, HASTINGS, and others"
11509,Henry VI Part 3,6,4.1.9,KING EDWARD IV,"Now, brother of Clarence, how like you our choice,"
11510,Henry VI Part 3,6,4.1.10,KING EDWARD IV,"That you stand pensive, as half malcontent?"
11511,Henry VI Part 3,7,4.1.11,CLARENCE,"As well as Lewis of France, or the Earl of Warwick,"
11512,Henry VI Part 3,7,4.1.12,CLARENCE,Which are so weak of courage and in judgment
11513,Henry VI Part 3,7,4.1.13,CLARENCE,That they'll take no offence at our abuse.
11514,Henry VI Part 3,8,4.1.14,KING EDWARD IV,"Suppose they take offence without a cause,"
11515,Henry VI Part 3,8,4.1.15,KING EDWARD IV,"They are but Lewis and Warwick: I am Edward,"
11516,Henry VI Part 3,8,4.1.16,KING EDWARD IV,"Your king and Warwick's, and must have my will."
11517,Henry VI Part 3,9,4.1.17,GLOUCESTER,"And shall have your will, because our king:"
11518,Henry VI Part 3,9,4.1.18,GLOUCESTER,Yet hasty marriage seldom proveth well.
11519,Henry VI Part 3,10,4.1.19,KING EDWARD IV,"Yea, brother Richard, are you offended too?"
11520,Henry VI Part 3,11,4.1.20,GLOUCESTER,Not I:
11521,Henry VI Part 3,11,4.1.21,GLOUCESTER,"No, God forbid that I should wish them sever'd"
11522,Henry VI Part 3,11,4.1.22,GLOUCESTER,"Whom God hath join'd together, ay, and 'twere pity"
11523,Henry VI Part 3,11,4.1.23,GLOUCESTER,To sunder them that yoke so well together.
11524,Henry VI Part 3,12,4.1.24,KING EDWARD IV,"Setting your scorns and your mislike aside,"
11525,Henry VI Part 3,12,4.1.25,KING EDWARD IV,Tell me some reason why the Lady Grey
11526,Henry VI Part 3,12,4.1.26,KING EDWARD IV,Should not become my wife and England's queen.
11527,Henry VI Part 3,12,4.1.27,KING EDWARD IV,"And you too, Somerset and Montague,"
11528,Henry VI Part 3,12,4.1.28,KING EDWARD IV,Speak freely what you think.
11529,Henry VI Part 3,13,4.1.29,CLARENCE,Then this is mine opinion: that King Lewis
11530,Henry VI Part 3,13,4.1.30,CLARENCE,"Becomes your enemy, for mocking him"
11531,Henry VI Part 3,13,4.1.31,CLARENCE,About the marriage of the Lady Bona.
11532,Henry VI Part 3,14,4.1.32,GLOUCESTER,"And Warwick, doing what you gave in charge,"
11533,Henry VI Part 3,14,4.1.33,GLOUCESTER,Is now dishonoured by this new marriage.
11534,Henry VI Part 3,15,4.1.34,KING EDWARD IV,What if both Lewis and Warwick be appeased
11535,Henry VI Part 3,15,4.1.35,KING EDWARD IV,By such invention as I can devise?
11536,Henry VI Part 3,16,4.1.36,MONTAGUE,"Yet, to have join'd with France in such alliance"
11537,Henry VI Part 3,16,4.1.37,MONTAGUE,Would more have strengthen'd this our commonwealth
11538,Henry VI Part 3,16,4.1.38,MONTAGUE,'Gainst foreign storms than any home-bred marriage.
11539,Henry VI Part 3,17,4.1.39,HASTINGS,"Why, knows not Montague that of itself"
11540,Henry VI Part 3,17,4.1.40,HASTINGS,"England is safe, if true within itself?"
11541,Henry VI Part 3,18,4.1.41,MONTAGUE,But the safer when 'tis back'd with France.
11542,Henry VI Part 3,19,4.1.42,HASTINGS,'Tis better using France than trusting France:
11543,Henry VI Part 3,19,4.1.43,HASTINGS,Let us be back'd with God and with the seas
11544,Henry VI Part 3,19,4.1.44,HASTINGS,"Which He hath given for fence impregnable,"
11545,Henry VI Part 3,19,4.1.45,HASTINGS,"And with their helps only defend ourselves,"
11546,Henry VI Part 3,19,4.1.46,HASTINGS,In them and in ourselves our safety lies.
11547,Henry VI Part 3,20,4.1.47,CLARENCE,For this one speech Lord Hastings well deserves
11548,Henry VI Part 3,20,4.1.48,CLARENCE,To have the heir of the Lord Hungerford.
11549,Henry VI Part 3,21,4.1.49,KING EDWARD IV,"Ay, what of that? it was my will and grant,"
11550,Henry VI Part 3,21,4.1.50,KING EDWARD IV,And for this once my will shall stand for law.
11551,Henry VI Part 3,22,4.1.51,GLOUCESTER,"And yet methinks your grace hath not done well,"
11552,Henry VI Part 3,22,4.1.52,GLOUCESTER,To give the heir and daughter of Lord Scales
11553,Henry VI Part 3,22,4.1.53,GLOUCESTER,"Unto the brother of your loving bride,"
11554,Henry VI Part 3,22,4.1.54,GLOUCESTER,She better would have fitted me or Clarence:
11555,Henry VI Part 3,22,4.1.55,GLOUCESTER,But in your bride you bury brotherhood.
11556,Henry VI Part 3,23,4.1.56,CLARENCE,Or else you would not have bestow'd the heir
11557,Henry VI Part 3,23,4.1.57,CLARENCE,"Of the Lord Bonville on your new wife's son,"
11558,Henry VI Part 3,23,4.1.58,CLARENCE,And leave your brothers to go speed elsewhere.
11559,Henry VI Part 3,24,4.1.59,KING EDWARD IV,"Alas, poor Clarence! is it for a wife"
11560,Henry VI Part 3,24,4.1.60,KING EDWARD IV,That thou art malcontent? I will provide thee.
11561,Henry VI Part 3,25,4.1.61,CLARENCE,"In choosing for yourself, you show'd your judgment,"
11562,Henry VI Part 3,25,4.1.62,CLARENCE,"Which being shallow, you give me leave"
11563,Henry VI Part 3,25,4.1.63,CLARENCE,"To play the broker in mine own behalf,"
11564,Henry VI Part 3,25,4.1.64,CLARENCE,And to that end I shortly mind to leave you.
11565,Henry VI Part 3,26,4.1.65,KING EDWARD IV,"Leave me, or tarry, Edward will be king,"
11566,Henry VI Part 3,26,4.1.66,KING EDWARD IV,And not be tied unto his brother's will.
11567,Henry VI Part 3,27,4.1.67,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"My lords, before it pleased his majesty"
11568,Henry VI Part 3,27,4.1.68,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"To raise my state to title of a queen,"
11569,Henry VI Part 3,27,4.1.69,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Do me but right, and you must all confess"
11570,Henry VI Part 3,27,4.1.70,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"That I was not ignoble of descent,"
11571,Henry VI Part 3,27,4.1.71,QUEEN ELIZABETH,And meaner than myself have had like fortune.
11572,Henry VI Part 3,27,4.1.72,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"But as this title honours me and mine,"
11573,Henry VI Part 3,27,4.1.73,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"So your dislike, to whom I would be pleasing,"
11574,Henry VI Part 3,27,4.1.74,QUEEN ELIZABETH,Doth cloud my joys with danger and with sorrow.
11575,Henry VI Part 3,28,4.1.75,KING EDWARD IV,"My love, forbear to fawn upon their frowns:"
11576,Henry VI Part 3,28,4.1.76,KING EDWARD IV,"What danger or what sorrow can befall thee,"
11577,Henry VI Part 3,28,4.1.77,KING EDWARD IV,"So long as Edward is thy constant friend,"
11578,Henry VI Part 3,28,4.1.78,KING EDWARD IV,"And their true sovereign, whom they must obey?"
11579,Henry VI Part 3,28,4.1.79,KING EDWARD IV,"Nay, whom they shall obey, and love thee too,"
11580,Henry VI Part 3,28,4.1.80,KING EDWARD IV,"Unless they seek for hatred at my hands,"
11581,Henry VI Part 3,28,4.1.81,KING EDWARD IV,"Which if they do, yet will I keep thee safe,"
11582,Henry VI Part 3,28,4.1.82,KING EDWARD IV,And they shall feel the vengeance of my wrath.
11583,Henry VI Part 3,29,4.1.83,GLOUCESTER,"[Aside]  I hear, yet say not much, but think the more."
11584,Henry VI Part 3,29,,GLOUCESTER,Enter a Post
11585,Henry VI Part 3,30,4.1.84,KING EDWARD IV,"Now, messenger, what letters or what news"
11586,Henry VI Part 3,30,4.1.85,KING EDWARD IV,From France?
11587,Henry VI Part 3,31,4.1.86,Post,"My sovereign liege, no letters, and few words,"
11588,Henry VI Part 3,31,4.1.87,Post,"But such as I, without your special pardon,"
11589,Henry VI Part 3,31,4.1.88,Post,Dare not relate.
11590,Henry VI Part 3,32,4.1.89,KING EDWARD IV,"Go to, we pardon thee: therefore, in brief,"
11591,Henry VI Part 3,32,4.1.90,KING EDWARD IV,Tell me their words as near as thou canst guess them.
11592,Henry VI Part 3,32,4.1.91,KING EDWARD IV,What answer makes King Lewis unto our letters?
11593,Henry VI Part 3,33,4.1.92,Post,"At my depart, these were his very words:"

11595,Henry VI Part 3,33,4.1.94,Post,That Lewis of France is sending over masquers
11596,Henry VI Part 3,33,4.1.95,Post,To revel it with him and his new bride.'
11597,Henry VI Part 3,34,4.1.96,KING EDWARD IV,Is Lewis so brave? belike he thinks me Henry.
11598,Henry VI Part 3,34,4.1.97,KING EDWARD IV,But what said Lady Bona to my marriage?
11599,Henry VI Part 3,35,4.1.98,Post,"These were her words, utter'd with mad disdain:"
11600,Henry VI Part 3,35,4.1.99,Post,"'Tell him, in hope he'll prove a widower shortly,"
11601,Henry VI Part 3,35,4.1.100,Post,I'll wear the willow garland for his sake.'
11602,Henry VI Part 3,36,4.1.101,KING EDWARD IV,"I blame not her, she could say little less,"
11603,Henry VI Part 3,36,4.1.102,KING EDWARD IV,She had the wrong. But what said Henry's queen?
11604,Henry VI Part 3,36,4.1.103,KING EDWARD IV,For I have heard that she was there in place.
11605,Henry VI Part 3,37,4.1.104,Post,"'Tell him,' quoth she, 'my mourning weeds are done,"
11606,Henry VI Part 3,37,4.1.105,Post,And I am ready to put armour on.'
11607,Henry VI Part 3,38,4.1.106,KING EDWARD IV,Belike she minds to play the Amazon.
11608,Henry VI Part 3,38,4.1.107,KING EDWARD IV,But what said Warwick to these injuries?
11609,Henry VI Part 3,39,4.1.108,Post,"He, more incensed against your majesty"
11610,Henry VI Part 3,39,4.1.109,Post,"Than all the rest, discharged me with these words:"
11611,Henry VI Part 3,39,4.1.110,Post,"'Tell him from me that he hath done me wrong,"
11612,Henry VI Part 3,39,4.1.111,Post,And therefore I'll uncrown him ere't be long.'
11613,Henry VI Part 3,40,4.1.112,KING EDWARD IV,Ha! durst the traitor breathe out so proud words?
11614,Henry VI Part 3,40,4.1.113,KING EDWARD IV,"Well I will arm me, being thus forewarn'd:"
11615,Henry VI Part 3,40,4.1.114,KING EDWARD IV,They shall have wars and pay for their presumption.
11616,Henry VI Part 3,40,4.1.115,KING EDWARD IV,"But say, is Warwick friends with Margaret?"
11617,Henry VI Part 3,41,4.1.116,Post,"Ay, gracious sovereign, they are so link'd in"

11622,Henry VI Part 3,42,4.1.121,CLARENCE,"For I will hence to Warwick's other daughter,"
11623,Henry VI Part 3,42,4.1.122,CLARENCE,"That, though I want a kingdom, yet in marriage"
11624,Henry VI Part 3,42,4.1.123,CLARENCE,I may not prove inferior to yourself.
11625,Henry VI Part 3,42,4.1.124,CLARENCE,"You that love me and Warwick, follow me."
11626,Henry VI Part 3,42,,CLARENCE,"Exit CLARENCE, and SOMERSET follows"
11627,Henry VI Part 3,43,4.1.125,GLOUCESTER,[Aside]  Not I:

11629,Henry VI Part 3,43,4.1.127,GLOUCESTER,"Stay not for the love of Edward, but the crown."

11632,Henry VI Part 3,44,4.1.130,KING EDWARD IV,And haste is needful in this desperate case.
11633,Henry VI Part 3,44,4.1.131,KING EDWARD IV,"Pembroke and Stafford, you in our behalf"
11634,Henry VI Part 3,44,4.1.132,KING EDWARD IV,"Go levy men, and make prepare for war,"
11635,Henry VI Part 3,44,4.1.133,KING EDWARD IV,"They are already, or quickly will be landed:"
11636,Henry VI Part 3,44,4.1.134,KING EDWARD IV,Myself in person will straight follow you.
11637,Henry VI Part 3,44,,KING EDWARD IV,Exeunt PEMBROKE and STAFFORD
11638,Henry VI Part 3,44,4.1.135,KING EDWARD IV,"But, ere I go, Hastings and Montague,"
11639,Henry VI Part 3,44,4.1.136,KING EDWARD IV,"Resolve my doubt. You twain, of all the rest,"
11640,Henry VI Part 3,44,4.1.137,KING EDWARD IV,Are near to Warwick by blood and by alliance:
11641,Henry VI Part 3,44,4.1.138,KING EDWARD IV,Tell me if you love Warwick more than me?
11642,Henry VI Part 3,44,4.1.139,KING EDWARD IV,"If it be so, then both depart to him,"
11643,Henry VI Part 3,44,4.1.140,KING EDWARD IV,I rather wish you foes than hollow friends:
11644,Henry VI Part 3,44,4.1.141,KING EDWARD IV,"But if you mind to hold your true obedience,"
11645,Henry VI Part 3,44,4.1.142,KING EDWARD IV,"Give me assurance with some friendly vow,"
11646,Henry VI Part 3,44,4.1.143,KING EDWARD IV,That I may never have you in suspect.
11647,Henry VI Part 3,45,4.1.144,MONTAGUE,So God help Montague as he proves true!
11648,Henry VI Part 3,46,4.1.145,HASTINGS,And Hastings as he favours Edward's cause!
11649,Henry VI Part 3,47,4.1.146,KING EDWARD IV,"Now, brother Richard, will you stand by us?"
11650,Henry VI Part 3,48,4.1.147,GLOUCESTER,"Ay, in despite of all that shall withstand you."
11651,Henry VI Part 3,49,4.1.148,KING EDWARD IV,"Why, so! then am I sure of victory."
11652,Henry VI Part 3,49,4.1.149,KING EDWARD IV,"Now therefore let us hence, and lose no hour,"

11657,Henry VI Part 3,1,4.2.1,WARWICK,"Trust me, my lord, all hitherto goes well,"
11658,Henry VI Part 3,1,4.2.2,WARWICK,The common people by numbers swarm to us.
11659,Henry VI Part 3,1,,WARWICK,Enter CLARENCE and SOMERSET
11660,Henry VI Part 3,1,4.2.3,WARWICK,But see where Somerset and Clarence come!
11661,Henry VI Part 3,1,4.2.4,WARWICK,"Speak suddenly, my lords, are we all friends?"
11662,Henry VI Part 3,2,4.2.5,CLARENCE,"Fear not that, my lord."
11663,Henry VI Part 3,3,4.2.6,WARWICK,"Then, gentle Clarence, welcome unto Warwick,"
11664,Henry VI Part 3,3,4.2.7,WARWICK,"And welcome, Somerset: I hold it cowardice"
11665,Henry VI Part 3,3,4.2.8,WARWICK,To rest mistrustful where a noble heart
11666,Henry VI Part 3,3,4.2.9,WARWICK,"Hath pawn'd an open hand in sign of love,"
11667,Henry VI Part 3,3,4.2.10,WARWICK,"Else might I think that Clarence, Edward's brother,"
11668,Henry VI Part 3,3,4.2.11,WARWICK,Were but a feigned friend to our proceedings:
11669,Henry VI Part 3,3,4.2.12,WARWICK,"But welcome, sweet Clarence, my daughter shall be thine."
11670,Henry VI Part 3,3,4.2.13,WARWICK,"And now what rests but, in night's coverture,"
11671,Henry VI Part 3,3,4.2.14,WARWICK,"Thy brother being carelessly encamp'd,"
11672,Henry VI Part 3,3,4.2.15,WARWICK,"His soldiers lurking in the towns about,"
11673,Henry VI Part 3,3,4.2.16,WARWICK,"And but attended by a simple guard,"
11674,Henry VI Part 3,3,4.2.17,WARWICK,We may surprise and take him at our pleasure?
11675,Henry VI Part 3,3,4.2.18,WARWICK,Our scouts have found the adventure very easy:
11676,Henry VI Part 3,3,4.2.19,WARWICK,That as Ulysses and stout Diomede
11677,Henry VI Part 3,3,4.2.20,WARWICK,"With sleight and manhood stole to Rhesus' tents,"
11678,Henry VI Part 3,3,4.2.21,WARWICK,"And brought from thence the Thracian fatal steeds,"
11679,Henry VI Part 3,3,4.2.22,WARWICK,"So we, well cover'd with the night's black mantle,"
11680,Henry VI Part 3,3,4.2.23,WARWICK,At unawares may beat down Edward's guard
11681,Henry VI Part 3,3,4.2.24,WARWICK,"And seize himself, I say not, slaughter him,"
11682,Henry VI Part 3,3,4.2.25,WARWICK,For I intend but only to surprise him.
11683,Henry VI Part 3,3,4.2.26,WARWICK,"You that will follow me to this attempt,"
11684,Henry VI Part 3,3,4.2.27,WARWICK,Applaud the name of Henry with your leader.
11685,Henry VI Part 3,3,4.2.27,WARWICK,"They all cry, 'Henry!'"
11686,Henry VI Part 3,3,4.2.28,WARWICK,"Why, then, let's on our way in silent sort:"

11693,Henry VI Part 3,2,4.3.3,Second Watchman,"What, will he not to bed?"
11694,Henry VI Part 3,3,4.3.4,First Watchman,"Why, no, for he hath made a solemn vow"
11695,Henry VI Part 3,3,4.3.5,First Watchman,Never to lie and take his natural rest
11696,Henry VI Part 3,3,4.3.6,First Watchman,Till Warwick or himself be quite suppress'd.
11697,Henry VI Part 3,4,4.3.7,Second Watchman,"To-morrow then belike shall be the day,"
11698,Henry VI Part 3,4,4.3.8,Second Watchman,If Warwick be so near as men report.
11699,Henry VI Part 3,5,4.3.9,Third Watchman,"But say, I pray, what nobleman is that"
11700,Henry VI Part 3,5,4.3.10,Third Watchman,That with the king here resteth in his tent?
11701,Henry VI Part 3,6,4.3.11,First Watchman,"'Tis the Lord Hastings, the king's chiefest friend."
11702,Henry VI Part 3,7,4.3.12,Third Watchman,"O, is it so? But why commands the king"
11703,Henry VI Part 3,7,4.3.13,Third Watchman,"That his chief followers lodge in towns about him,"
11704,Henry VI Part 3,7,4.3.14,Third Watchman,While he himself keeps in the cold field?
11705,Henry VI Part 3,8,4.3.15,Second Watchman,"'Tis the more honour, because more dangerous."
11706,Henry VI Part 3,9,4.3.16,Third Watchman,"Ay, but give me worship and quietness,"
11707,Henry VI Part 3,9,4.3.17,Third Watchman,I like it better than a dangerous honour.
11708,Henry VI Part 3,9,4.3.18,Third Watchman,"If Warwick knew in what estate he stands,"
11709,Henry VI Part 3,9,4.3.19,Third Watchman,'Tis to be doubted he would waken him.
11710,Henry VI Part 3,10,4.3.20,First Watchman,Unless our halberds did shut up his passage.
11711,Henry VI Part 3,11,4.3.21,Second Watchman,"Ay, wherefore else guard we his royal tent,"
11712,Henry VI Part 3,11,4.3.22,Second Watchman,But to defend his person from night-foes?
11713,Henry VI Part 3,11,,Second Watchman,"Enter WARWICK, CLARENCE, OXFORD, SOMERSET, and French soldiers, silent all"
11714,Henry VI Part 3,12,4.3.23,WARWICK,"This is his tent, and see where stand his guard."
11715,Henry VI Part 3,12,4.3.24,WARWICK,"Courage, my masters! honour now or never!"
11716,Henry VI Part 3,12,4.3.25,WARWICK,"But follow me, and Edward shall be ours."
11717,Henry VI Part 3,13,4.3.26,First Watchman,Who goes there?
11718,Henry VI Part 3,14,4.3.27,Second Watchman,"Stay, or thou diest!"
11719,Henry VI Part 3,14,4.3.27,Second Watchman,"WARWICK and the rest cry all, 'Warwick! Warwick!'  and set upon the Guard, who fly, crying, 'Arm! arm!' WARWICK and the rest following them"
11720,Henry VI Part 3,14,,Second Watchman,"The drum playing and trumpet sounding, reenter  WARWICK, SOMERSET, and the rest, bringing KING  EDWARD IV out in his gown, sitting in a chair. RICHARD and HASTINGS fly over the stage"
11721,Henry VI Part 3,15,4.3.28,SOMERSET,What are they that fly there?
11722,Henry VI Part 3,16,4.3.29,WARWICK,"Richard and Hastings: let them go, here is The duke."
11723,Henry VI Part 3,17,4.3.30,KING EDWARD IV,"The duke! Why, Warwick, when we parted,"
11724,Henry VI Part 3,17,4.3.31,KING EDWARD IV,Thou call'dst me king.
11725,Henry VI Part 3,18,4.3.32,WARWICK,"Ay, but the case is alter'd:"
11726,Henry VI Part 3,18,4.3.33,WARWICK,"When you disgraced me in my embassade,"
11727,Henry VI Part 3,18,4.3.34,WARWICK,"Then I degraded you from being king,"
11728,Henry VI Part 3,18,4.3.35,WARWICK,And come now to create you Duke of York.
11729,Henry VI Part 3,18,4.3.36,WARWICK,"Alas! how should you govern any kingdom,"
11730,Henry VI Part 3,18,4.3.37,WARWICK,"That know not how to use ambassadors,"
11731,Henry VI Part 3,18,4.3.38,WARWICK,"Nor how to be contented with one wife,"
11732,Henry VI Part 3,18,4.3.39,WARWICK,"Nor how to use your brothers brotherly,"
11733,Henry VI Part 3,18,4.3.40,WARWICK,"Nor how to study for the people's welfare,"
11734,Henry VI Part 3,18,4.3.41,WARWICK,Nor how to shroud yourself from enemies?
11735,Henry VI Part 3,19,4.3.42,KING EDWARD IV,"Yea, brother of Clarence, are thou here too?"
11736,Henry VI Part 3,19,4.3.43,KING EDWARD IV,"Nay, then I see that Edward needs must down."
11737,Henry VI Part 3,19,4.3.44,KING EDWARD IV,"Yet, Warwick, in despite of all mischance,"
11738,Henry VI Part 3,19,4.3.45,KING EDWARD IV,"Of thee thyself and all thy complices,"
11739,Henry VI Part 3,19,4.3.46,KING EDWARD IV,Edward will always bear himself as king:
11740,Henry VI Part 3,19,4.3.47,KING EDWARD IV,"Though fortune's malice overthrow my state,"
11741,Henry VI Part 3,19,4.3.48,KING EDWARD IV,My mind exceeds the compass of her wheel.
11742,Henry VI Part 3,20,4.3.49,WARWICK,"Then, for his mind, be Edward England's king:"
11743,Henry VI Part 3,20,,WARWICK,Takes off his crown
11744,Henry VI Part 3,20,4.3.50,WARWICK,"But Henry now shall wear the English crown,"
11745,Henry VI Part 3,20,4.3.51,WARWICK,"And be true king indeed, thou but the shadow."
11746,Henry VI Part 3,20,4.3.52,WARWICK,"My Lord of Somerset, at my request,"
11747,Henry VI Part 3,20,4.3.53,WARWICK,See that forthwith Duke Edward be convey'd
11748,Henry VI Part 3,20,4.3.54,WARWICK,"Unto my brother, Archbishop of York."
11749,Henry VI Part 3,20,4.3.55,WARWICK,"When I have fought with Pembroke and his fellows,"
11750,Henry VI Part 3,20,4.3.56,WARWICK,"I'll follow you, and tell what answer"

11752,Henry VI Part 3,20,4.3.58,WARWICK,"Now, for a while farewell, good Duke of York."
11753,Henry VI Part 3,20,,WARWICK,They lead him out forcibly
11754,Henry VI Part 3,21,4.3.59,KING EDWARD IV,"What fates impose, that men must needs abide,"
11755,Henry VI Part 3,21,4.3.60,KING EDWARD IV,It boots not to resist both wind and tide.
11756,Henry VI Part 3,21,,KING EDWARD IV,"Exit, guarded"

11758,Henry VI Part 3,22,4.3.62,OXFORD,But march to London with our soldiers?
11759,Henry VI Part 3,23,4.3.63,WARWICK,"Ay, that's the first thing that we have to do,"
11760,Henry VI Part 3,23,4.3.64,WARWICK,To free King Henry from imprisonment
11761,Henry VI Part 3,23,4.3.65,WARWICK,And see him seated in the regal throne.

11767,Henry VI Part 3,2,4.4.3,QUEEN ELIZABETH,What late misfortune is befall'n King Edward?
11768,Henry VI Part 3,3,4.4.4,RIVERS,What! loss of some pitch'd battle against Warwick?
11769,Henry VI Part 3,4,4.4.5,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"No, but the loss of his own royal person."
11770,Henry VI Part 3,5,4.4.6,RIVERS,Then is my sovereign slain?
11771,Henry VI Part 3,6,4.4.7,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Ay, almost slain, for he is taken prisoner,"
11772,Henry VI Part 3,6,4.4.8,QUEEN ELIZABETH,Either betray'd by falsehood of his guard
11773,Henry VI Part 3,6,4.4.9,QUEEN ELIZABETH,Or by his foe surprised at unawares:
11774,Henry VI Part 3,6,4.4.10,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"And, as I further have to understand,"
11775,Henry VI Part 3,6,4.4.11,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Is new committed to the Bishop of York,"
11776,Henry VI Part 3,6,4.4.12,QUEEN ELIZABETH,Fell Warwick's brother and by that our foe.
11777,Henry VI Part 3,7,4.4.13,RIVERS,"These news I must confess are full of grief,"
11778,Henry VI Part 3,7,4.4.14,RIVERS,"Yet, gracious madam, bear it as you may:"
11779,Henry VI Part 3,7,4.4.15,RIVERS,"Warwick may lose, that now hath won the day."
11780,Henry VI Part 3,8,4.4.16,QUEEN ELIZABETH,Till then fair hope must hinder life's decay.
11781,Henry VI Part 3,8,4.4.17,QUEEN ELIZABETH,And I the rather wean me from despair
11782,Henry VI Part 3,8,4.4.18,QUEEN ELIZABETH,For love of Edward's offspring in my womb:
11783,Henry VI Part 3,8,4.4.19,QUEEN ELIZABETH,This is it that makes me bridle passion
11784,Henry VI Part 3,8,4.4.20,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"And bear with mildness my misfortune's cross,"
11785,Henry VI Part 3,8,4.4.21,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Ay, ay, for this I draw in many a tear"
11786,Henry VI Part 3,8,4.4.22,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"And stop the rising of blood-sucking sighs,"
11787,Henry VI Part 3,8,4.4.23,QUEEN ELIZABETH,Lest with my sighs or tears I blast or drown
11788,Henry VI Part 3,8,4.4.24,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"King Edward's fruit, true heir to the English crown."
11789,Henry VI Part 3,9,4.4.25,RIVERS,"But, madam, where is Warwick then become?"
11790,Henry VI Part 3,10,4.4.26,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"I am inform'd that he comes towards London,"
11791,Henry VI Part 3,10,4.4.27,QUEEN ELIZABETH,To set the crown once more on Henry's head:
11792,Henry VI Part 3,10,4.4.28,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Guess thou the rest, King Edward's friends must down,"
11793,Henry VI Part 3,10,4.4.29,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"But, to prevent the tyrant's violence,--"
11794,Henry VI Part 3,10,4.4.30,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"For trust not him that hath once broken faith,--"
11795,Henry VI Part 3,10,4.4.31,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"I'll hence forthwith unto the sanctuary,"
11796,Henry VI Part 3,10,4.4.32,QUEEN ELIZABETH,To save at least the heir of Edward's right:
11797,Henry VI Part 3,10,4.4.33,QUEEN ELIZABETH,There shall I rest secure from force and fraud.
11798,Henry VI Part 3,10,4.4.34,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Come, therefore, let us fly while we may fly:"
11799,Henry VI Part 3,10,4.4.35,QUEEN ELIZABETH,If Warwick take us we are sure to die.

11803,Henry VI Part 3,1,4.5.1,GLOUCESTER,"Now, my Lord Hastings and Sir William Stanley,"
11804,Henry VI Part 3,1,4.5.2,GLOUCESTER,"Leave off to wonder why I drew you hither,"
11805,Henry VI Part 3,1,4.5.3,GLOUCESTER,Into this chiefest thicket of the park.
11806,Henry VI Part 3,1,4.5.4,GLOUCESTER,"Thus stands the case: you know our king, my brother,"
11807,Henry VI Part 3,1,4.5.5,GLOUCESTER,"Is prisoner to the bishop here, at whose hands"
11808,Henry VI Part 3,1,4.5.6,GLOUCESTER,"He hath good usage and great liberty,"
11809,Henry VI Part 3,1,4.5.7,GLOUCESTER,"And, often but attended with weak guard,"
11810,Henry VI Part 3,1,4.5.8,GLOUCESTER,Comes hunting this way to disport himself.
11811,Henry VI Part 3,1,4.5.9,GLOUCESTER,I have advertised him by secret means
11812,Henry VI Part 3,1,4.5.10,GLOUCESTER,That if about this hour he make his way
11813,Henry VI Part 3,1,4.5.11,GLOUCESTER,"Under the colour of his usual game,"
11814,Henry VI Part 3,1,4.5.12,GLOUCESTER,He shall here find his friends with horse and men
11815,Henry VI Part 3,1,4.5.13,GLOUCESTER,To set him free from his captivity.
11816,Henry VI Part 3,1,,GLOUCESTER,Enter KING EDWARD IV and a Huntsman with him
11817,Henry VI Part 3,2,4.5.14,Huntsman,"This way, my lord, for this way lies the game."
11818,Henry VI Part 3,3,4.5.15,KING EDWARD IV,"Nay, this way, man: see where the huntsmen stand."
11819,Henry VI Part 3,3,4.5.16,KING EDWARD IV,"Now, brother of Gloucester, Lord Hastings, and the rest,"
11820,Henry VI Part 3,3,4.5.17,KING EDWARD IV,"Stand you thus close, to steal the bishop's deer?"
11821,Henry VI Part 3,4,4.5.18,GLOUCESTER,"Brother, the time and case requireth haste:"
11822,Henry VI Part 3,4,4.5.19,GLOUCESTER,Your horse stands ready at the park-corner.
11823,Henry VI Part 3,5,4.5.20,KING EDWARD IV,But whither shall we then?
11824,Henry VI Part 3,6,4.5.21,HASTINGS,"To Lynn, my lord,"
11825,Henry VI Part 3,6,4.5.22,HASTINGS,And ship from thence to Flanders.
11826,Henry VI Part 3,7,4.5.23,GLOUCESTER,"Well guess'd, believe me, for that was my meaning."
11827,Henry VI Part 3,8,4.5.24,KING EDWARD IV,"Stanley, I will requite thy forwardness."
11828,Henry VI Part 3,9,4.5.25,GLOUCESTER,But wherefore stay we? 'tis no time to talk.
11829,Henry VI Part 3,10,4.5.26,KING EDWARD IV,"Huntsman, what say'st thou? wilt thou go along?"
11830,Henry VI Part 3,11,4.5.27,Huntsman,Better do so than tarry and be hang'd.
11831,Henry VI Part 3,12,4.5.28,GLOUCESTER,"Come then, away, let's ha' no more ado."
11832,Henry VI Part 3,13,4.5.29,KING EDWARD IV,"Bishop, farewell: shield thee from Warwick's frown,"
11833,Henry VI Part 3,13,4.5.30,KING EDWARD IV,And pray that I may repossess the crown.
11834,Henry VI Part 3,13,,KING EDWARD IV,Exeunt

11837,Henry VI Part 3,1,4.6.1,KING HENRY VI,"Master lieutenant, now that God and friends"
11838,Henry VI Part 3,1,4.6.2,KING HENRY VI,"Have shaken Edward from the regal seat,"
11839,Henry VI Part 3,1,4.6.3,KING HENRY VI,"And turn'd my captive state to liberty,"
11840,Henry VI Part 3,1,4.6.4,KING HENRY VI,"My fear to hope, my sorrows unto joys,"
11841,Henry VI Part 3,1,4.6.5,KING HENRY VI,At our enlargement what are thy due fees?
11842,Henry VI Part 3,2,4.6.6,Lieutenant,"Subjects may challenge nothing of their sovereigns,"
11843,Henry VI Part 3,2,4.6.7,Lieutenant,"But if an humble prayer may prevail,"
11844,Henry VI Part 3,2,4.6.8,Lieutenant,I then crave pardon of your majesty.
11845,Henry VI Part 3,3,4.6.9,KING HENRY VI,"For what, lieutenant? for well using me?"
11846,Henry VI Part 3,3,4.6.10,KING HENRY VI,"Nay, be thou sure I'll well requite thy kindness,"
11847,Henry VI Part 3,3,4.6.11,KING HENRY VI,"For that it made my imprisonment a pleasure,"
11848,Henry VI Part 3,3,4.6.12,KING HENRY VI,"Ay, such a pleasure as incaged birds"
11849,Henry VI Part 3,3,4.6.13,KING HENRY VI,Conceive when after many moody thoughts
11850,Henry VI Part 3,3,4.6.14,KING HENRY VI,At last by notes of household harmony
11851,Henry VI Part 3,3,4.6.15,KING HENRY VI,They quite forget their loss of liberty.
11852,Henry VI Part 3,3,4.6.16,KING HENRY VI,"But, Warwick, after God, thou set'st me free,"
11853,Henry VI Part 3,3,4.6.17,KING HENRY VI,"And chiefly therefore I thank God and thee,"
11854,Henry VI Part 3,3,4.6.18,KING HENRY VI,"He was the author, thou the instrument."
11855,Henry VI Part 3,3,4.6.19,KING HENRY VI,"Therefore, that I may conquer fortune's spite"
11856,Henry VI Part 3,3,4.6.20,KING HENRY VI,"By living low, where fortune cannot hurt me,"
11857,Henry VI Part 3,3,4.6.21,KING HENRY VI,And that the people of this blessed land
11858,Henry VI Part 3,3,4.6.22,KING HENRY VI,"May not be punish'd with my thwarting stars,"
11859,Henry VI Part 3,3,4.6.23,KING HENRY VI,"Warwick, although my head still wear the crown,"
11860,Henry VI Part 3,3,4.6.24,KING HENRY VI,"I here resign my government to thee,"
11861,Henry VI Part 3,3,4.6.25,KING HENRY VI,For thou art fortunate in all thy deeds.
11862,Henry VI Part 3,4,4.6.26,WARWICK,"Your grace hath still been famed for virtuous,"
11863,Henry VI Part 3,4,4.6.27,WARWICK,"And now may seem as wise as virtuous,"
11864,Henry VI Part 3,4,4.6.28,WARWICK,"By spying and avoiding fortune's malice,"
11865,Henry VI Part 3,4,4.6.29,WARWICK,For few men rightly temper with the stars:
11866,Henry VI Part 3,4,4.6.30,WARWICK,"Yet in this one thing let me blame your grace,"
11867,Henry VI Part 3,4,4.6.31,WARWICK,For choosing me when Clarence is in place.
11868,Henry VI Part 3,5,4.6.32,CLARENCE,"No, Warwick, thou art worthy of the sway,"
11869,Henry VI Part 3,5,4.6.33,CLARENCE,To whom the heavens in thy nativity
11870,Henry VI Part 3,5,4.6.34,CLARENCE,"Adjudged an olive branch and laurel crown,"
11871,Henry VI Part 3,5,4.6.35,CLARENCE,"As likely to be blest in peace and war,"
11872,Henry VI Part 3,5,4.6.36,CLARENCE,And therefore I yield thee my free consent.
11873,Henry VI Part 3,6,4.6.37,WARWICK,And I choose Clarence only for protector.
11874,Henry VI Part 3,7,4.6.38,KING HENRY VI,Warwick and Clarence give me both your hands:
11875,Henry VI Part 3,7,4.6.39,KING HENRY VI,"Now join your hands, and with your hands your hearts,"
11876,Henry VI Part 3,7,4.6.40,KING HENRY VI,That no dissension hinder government:
11877,Henry VI Part 3,7,4.6.41,KING HENRY VI,"I make you both protectors of this land,"
11878,Henry VI Part 3,7,4.6.42,KING HENRY VI,While I myself will lead a private life
11879,Henry VI Part 3,7,4.6.43,KING HENRY VI,"And in devotion spend my latter days,"
11880,Henry VI Part 3,7,4.6.44,KING HENRY VI,To sin's rebuke and my Creator's praise.
11881,Henry VI Part 3,8,4.6.45,WARWICK,What answers Clarence to his sovereign's will?
11882,Henry VI Part 3,9,4.6.46,CLARENCE,"That he consents, if Warwick yield consent,"
11883,Henry VI Part 3,9,4.6.47,CLARENCE,For on thy fortune I repose myself.
11884,Henry VI Part 3,10,4.6.48,WARWICK,"Why, then, though loath, yet must I be content:"
11885,Henry VI Part 3,10,4.6.49,WARWICK,"We'll yoke together, like a double shadow"
11886,Henry VI Part 3,10,4.6.50,WARWICK,"To Henry's body, and supply his place,"
11887,Henry VI Part 3,10,4.6.51,WARWICK,"I mean, in bearing weight of government,"
11888,Henry VI Part 3,10,4.6.52,WARWICK,While he enjoys the honour and his ease.
11889,Henry VI Part 3,10,4.6.53,WARWICK,"And, Clarence, now then it is more than needful"
11890,Henry VI Part 3,10,4.6.54,WARWICK,"Forthwith that Edward be pronounced a traitor,"
11891,Henry VI Part 3,10,4.6.55,WARWICK,And all his lands and goods be confiscate.
11892,Henry VI Part 3,11,4.6.56,CLARENCE,What else? and that succession be determined.
11893,Henry VI Part 3,12,4.6.57,WARWICK,"Ay, therein Clarence shall not want his part."
11894,Henry VI Part 3,13,4.6.58,KING HENRY VI,"But, with the first of all your chief affairs,"
11895,Henry VI Part 3,13,4.6.59,KING HENRY VI,"Let me entreat, for I command no more,"
11896,Henry VI Part 3,13,4.6.60,KING HENRY VI,That Margaret your queen and my son Edward
11897,Henry VI Part 3,13,4.6.61,KING HENRY VI,"Be sent for, to return from France with speed,"
11898,Henry VI Part 3,13,4.6.62,KING HENRY VI,"For, till I see them here, by doubtful fear"
11899,Henry VI Part 3,13,4.6.63,KING HENRY VI,My joy of liberty is half eclipsed.
11900,Henry VI Part 3,14,4.6.64,CLARENCE,"It shall be done, my sovereign, with all speed."
11901,Henry VI Part 3,15,4.6.65,KING HENRY VI,"My Lord of Somerset, what youth is that,"
11902,Henry VI Part 3,15,4.6.66,KING HENRY VI,Of whom you seem to have so tender care?
11903,Henry VI Part 3,16,4.6.67,SOMERSET,"My liege, it is young Henry, earl of Richmond."
11904,Henry VI Part 3,17,4.6.68,KING HENRY VI,"Come hither, England's hope."
11905,Henry VI Part 3,17,,KING HENRY VI,Lays his hand on his head
11906,Henry VI Part 3,17,4.6.69,KING HENRY VI,If secret powers
11907,Henry VI Part 3,17,4.6.70,KING HENRY VI,"Suggest but truth to my divining thoughts,"
11908,Henry VI Part 3,17,4.6.71,KING HENRY VI,This pretty lad will prove our country's bliss.
11909,Henry VI Part 3,17,4.6.72,KING HENRY VI,"His looks are full of peaceful majesty,"
11910,Henry VI Part 3,17,4.6.73,KING HENRY VI,"His head by nature framed to wear a crown,"
11911,Henry VI Part 3,17,4.6.74,KING HENRY VI,"His hand to wield a sceptre, and himself"
11912,Henry VI Part 3,17,4.6.75,KING HENRY VI,Likely in time to bless a regal throne.
11913,Henry VI Part 3,17,4.6.76,KING HENRY VI,"Make much of him, my lords, for this is he"
11914,Henry VI Part 3,17,4.6.77,KING HENRY VI,Must help you more than you are hurt by me.
11915,Henry VI Part 3,17,,KING HENRY VI,Enter a Post
11916,Henry VI Part 3,18,4.6.78,WARWICK,"What news, my friend?"
11917,Henry VI Part 3,19,4.6.79,Post,"That Edward is escaped from your brother,"
11918,Henry VI Part 3,19,4.6.80,Post,"And fled, as he hears since, to Burgundy."
11919,Henry VI Part 3,20,4.6.81,WARWICK,Unsavoury news! but how made he escape?
11920,Henry VI Part 3,21,4.6.82,Post,He was convey'd by Richard Duke of Gloucester
11921,Henry VI Part 3,21,4.6.83,Post,"And the Lord Hastings, who attended him"
11922,Henry VI Part 3,21,4.6.84,Post,In secret ambush on the forest side
11923,Henry VI Part 3,21,4.6.85,Post,"And from the bishop's huntsmen rescued him,"
11924,Henry VI Part 3,21,4.6.86,Post,For hunting was his daily exercise.
11925,Henry VI Part 3,22,4.6.87,WARWICK,My brother was too careless of his charge.
11926,Henry VI Part 3,22,4.6.88,WARWICK,"But let us hence, my sovereign, to provide"
11927,Henry VI Part 3,22,4.6.89,WARWICK,A salve for any sore that may betide.
11928,Henry VI Part 3,22,,WARWICK,"Exeunt all but SOMERSET, HENRY OF RICHMOND, and OXFORD"
11929,Henry VI Part 3,23,4.6.90,SOMERSET,"My lord, I like not of this flight of Edward's,"
11930,Henry VI Part 3,23,4.6.91,SOMERSET,"For doubtless Burgundy will yield him help,"
11931,Henry VI Part 3,23,4.6.92,SOMERSET,And we shall have more wars before 't be long.
11932,Henry VI Part 3,23,4.6.93,SOMERSET,As Henry's late presaging prophecy
11933,Henry VI Part 3,23,4.6.94,SOMERSET,"Did glad my heart with hope of this young Richmond,"
11934,Henry VI Part 3,23,4.6.95,SOMERSET,"So doth my heart misgive me, in these conflicts"
11935,Henry VI Part 3,23,4.6.96,SOMERSET,"What may befall him, to his harm and ours:"
11936,Henry VI Part 3,23,4.6.97,SOMERSET,"Therefore, Lord Oxford, to prevent the worst,"
11937,Henry VI Part 3,23,4.6.98,SOMERSET,"Forthwith we'll send him hence to Brittany,"
11938,Henry VI Part 3,23,4.6.99,SOMERSET,Till storms be past of civil enmity.
11939,Henry VI Part 3,24,4.6.100,OXFORD,"Ay, for if Edward repossess the crown,"
11940,Henry VI Part 3,24,4.6.101,OXFORD,'Tis like that Richmond with the rest shall down.
11941,Henry VI Part 3,25,4.6.102,SOMERSET,"It shall be so, he shall to Brittany."
11942,Henry VI Part 3,25,4.6.103,SOMERSET,"Come, therefore, let's about it speedily."

11946,Henry VI Part 3,1,4.7.1,KING EDWARD IV,"Now, brother Richard, Lord Hastings, and the rest,"
11947,Henry VI Part 3,1,4.7.2,KING EDWARD IV,"Yet thus far fortune maketh us amends,"
11948,Henry VI Part 3,1,4.7.3,KING EDWARD IV,And says that once more I shall interchange
11949,Henry VI Part 3,1,4.7.4,KING EDWARD IV,My waned state for Henry's regal crown.
11950,Henry VI Part 3,1,4.7.5,KING EDWARD IV,Well have we pass'd and now repass'd the seas
11951,Henry VI Part 3,1,4.7.6,KING EDWARD IV,And brought desired help from Burgundy:
11952,Henry VI Part 3,1,4.7.7,KING EDWARD IV,"What then remains, we being thus arrived"
11953,Henry VI Part 3,1,4.7.8,KING EDWARD IV,"From Ravenspurgh haven before the gates of York,"
11954,Henry VI Part 3,1,4.7.9,KING EDWARD IV,"But that we enter, as into our dukedom?"
11955,Henry VI Part 3,2,4.7.10,GLOUCESTER,"The gates made fast! Brother, I like not this,"
11956,Henry VI Part 3,2,4.7.11,GLOUCESTER,For many men that stumble at the threshold
11957,Henry VI Part 3,2,4.7.12,GLOUCESTER,Are well foretold that danger lurks within.
11958,Henry VI Part 3,3,4.7.13,KING EDWARD IV,"Tush, man, abodements must not now affright us:"
11959,Henry VI Part 3,3,4.7.14,KING EDWARD IV,"By fair or foul means we must enter in,"
11960,Henry VI Part 3,3,4.7.15,KING EDWARD IV,For hither will our friends repair to us.
11961,Henry VI Part 3,4,4.7.16,HASTINGS,"My liege, I'll knock once more to summon them."
11962,Henry VI Part 3,4,,HASTINGS,"Enter, on the walls, the Mayor of York, and his Brethren"
11963,Henry VI Part 3,5,4.7.17,Mayor,"My lords, we were forewarned of your coming,"
11964,Henry VI Part 3,5,4.7.18,Mayor,"And shut the gates for safety of ourselves,"
11965,Henry VI Part 3,5,4.7.19,Mayor,For now we owe allegiance unto Henry.
11966,Henry VI Part 3,6,4.7.20,KING EDWARD IV,"But, master mayor, if Henry be your king,"
11967,Henry VI Part 3,6,4.7.21,KING EDWARD IV,Yet Edward at the least is Duke of York.
11968,Henry VI Part 3,7,4.7.22,Mayor,"True, my good lord, I know you for no less."
11969,Henry VI Part 3,8,4.7.23,KING EDWARD IV,"Why, and I challenge nothing but my dukedom,"
11970,Henry VI Part 3,8,4.7.24,KING EDWARD IV,As being well content with that alone.
11971,Henry VI Part 3,9,4.7.25,GLOUCESTER,"[Aside]  But when the fox hath once got in his nose,"
11972,Henry VI Part 3,9,4.7.26,GLOUCESTER,He'll soon find means to make the body follow.
11973,Henry VI Part 3,10,4.7.27,HASTINGS,"Why, master mayor, why stand you in a doubt?"
11974,Henry VI Part 3,10,4.7.28,HASTINGS,"Open the gates, we are King Henry's friends."
11975,Henry VI Part 3,11,4.7.29,Mayor,"Ay, say you so? the gates shall then be open'd."
11976,Henry VI Part 3,11,,Mayor,They descend
11977,Henry VI Part 3,12,4.7.30,GLOUCESTER,"A wise stout captain, and soon persuaded!"
11978,Henry VI Part 3,13,4.7.31,HASTINGS,"The good old man would fain that all were well,"
11979,Henry VI Part 3,13,4.7.32,HASTINGS,"So 'twere not 'long of him, but being enter'd,"
11980,Henry VI Part 3,13,4.7.33,HASTINGS,"I doubt not, I, but we shall soon persuade"
11981,Henry VI Part 3,13,4.7.34,HASTINGS,Both him and all his brothers unto reason.
11982,Henry VI Part 3,13,,HASTINGS,"Enter the Mayor and two Aldermen, below"
11983,Henry VI Part 3,14,4.7.35,KING EDWARD IV,"So, master mayor: these gates must not be shut"
11984,Henry VI Part 3,14,4.7.36,KING EDWARD IV,But in the night or in the time of war.
11985,Henry VI Part 3,14,4.7.37,KING EDWARD IV,"What! fear not, man, but yield me up the keys,"
11986,Henry VI Part 3,14,,KING EDWARD IV,Takes his keys
11987,Henry VI Part 3,14,4.7.38,KING EDWARD IV,"For Edward will defend the town and thee,"
11988,Henry VI Part 3,14,4.7.39,KING EDWARD IV,And all those friends that deign to follow me.
11989,Henry VI Part 3,14,,KING EDWARD IV,"March. Enter MONTGOMERY, with drum and soldiers"
11990,Henry VI Part 3,15,4.7.40,GLOUCESTER,"Brother, this is Sir John Montgomery,"

11992,Henry VI Part 3,16,4.7.42,KING EDWARD IV,"Welcome, Sir John! But why come you in arms?"
11993,Henry VI Part 3,17,4.7.43,MONTAGUE,"To help King Edward in his time of storm,"
11994,Henry VI Part 3,17,4.7.44,MONTAGUE,As every loyal subject ought to do.
11995,Henry VI Part 3,18,4.7.45,KING EDWARD IV,"Thanks, good Montgomery, but we now forget"
11996,Henry VI Part 3,18,4.7.46,KING EDWARD IV,Our title to the crown and only claim
11997,Henry VI Part 3,18,4.7.47,KING EDWARD IV,Our dukedom till God please to send the rest.
11998,Henry VI Part 3,19,4.7.48,MONTAGUE,"Then fare you well, for I will hence again:"
11999,Henry VI Part 3,19,4.7.49,MONTAGUE,I came to serve a king and not a duke.
12000,Henry VI Part 3,19,4.7.50,MONTAGUE,"Drummer, strike up, and let us march away."
12001,Henry VI Part 3,19,,MONTAGUE,The drum begins to march
12002,Henry VI Part 3,20,4.7.51,KING EDWARD IV,"Nay, stay, Sir John, awhi le, and we'll debate"
12003,Henry VI Part 3,20,4.7.52,KING EDWARD IV,By what safe means the crown may be recover'd.
12004,Henry VI Part 3,21,4.7.53,MONTAGUE,"What talk you of debating? in few words,"
12005,Henry VI Part 3,21,4.7.54,MONTAGUE,"If you'll not here proclaim yourself our king,"
12006,Henry VI Part 3,21,4.7.55,MONTAGUE,I'll leave you to your fortune and be gone
12007,Henry VI Part 3,21,4.7.56,MONTAGUE,To keep them back that come to succor you:
12008,Henry VI Part 3,21,4.7.57,MONTAGUE,"Why shall we fight, if you pretend no title?"
12009,Henry VI Part 3,22,4.7.58,GLOUCESTER,"Why, brother, wherefore stand you on nice points?"
12010,Henry VI Part 3,23,4.7.59,KING EDWARD IV,"When we grow stronger, then we'll make our claim:"
12011,Henry VI Part 3,23,4.7.60,KING EDWARD IV,"Till then, 'tis wisdom to conceal our meaning."
12012,Henry VI Part 3,24,4.7.61,HASTINGS,Away with scrupulous wit! now arms must rule.
12013,Henry VI Part 3,25,4.7.62,GLOUCESTER,And fearless minds climb soonest unto crowns.
12014,Henry VI Part 3,25,4.7.63,GLOUCESTER,"Brother, we will proclaim you out of hand:"
12015,Henry VI Part 3,25,4.7.64,GLOUCESTER,The bruit thereof will bring you many friends.
12016,Henry VI Part 3,26,4.7.65,KING EDWARD IV,"Then be it as you will, for 'tis my right,"
12017,Henry VI Part 3,26,4.7.66,KING EDWARD IV,And Henry but usurps the diadem.
12018,Henry VI Part 3,27,4.7.67,MONTAGUE,"Ay, now my sovereign speaketh like himself,"
12019,Henry VI Part 3,27,4.7.68,MONTAGUE,And now will I be Edward's champion.

12034,Henry VI Part 3,32,4.7.81,KING EDWARD IV,"We'll forward towards Warwick and his mates,"
12035,Henry VI Part 3,32,4.7.82,KING EDWARD IV,For well I wot that Henry is no soldier.
12036,Henry VI Part 3,32,4.7.83,KING EDWARD IV,"Ah, froward Clarence! how evil it beseems thee"
12037,Henry VI Part 3,32,4.7.84,KING EDWARD IV,To flatter Henry and forsake thy brother!
12038,Henry VI Part 3,32,4.7.85,KING EDWARD IV,"Yet, as we may, we'll meet both thee and Warwick."

12079,Henry VI Part 3,12,4.8.35,KING HENRY VI,Methinks the power that Edward hath in field
12080,Henry VI Part 3,12,4.8.36,KING HENRY VI,Should not be able to encounter mine.
12081,Henry VI Part 3,13,4.8.37,EXETER,The doubt is that he will seduce the rest.

12124,Henry VI Part 3,5,5.1.8,WARWICK,"And, by thy guess, how nigh is Clarence now?"
12125,Henry VI Part 3,6,5.1.9,SOMERSET,"At Southam I did leave him with his forces,"
12126,Henry VI Part 3,6,5.1.10,SOMERSET,And do expect him here some two hours hence.
12127,Henry VI Part 3,6,,SOMERSET,Drum heard
12128,Henry VI Part 3,7,5.1.11,WARWICK,"Then Clarence is at hand, I hear his drum."
12129,Henry VI Part 3,8,5.1.12,SOMERSET,"It is not his, my lord, here Southam lies:"
12130,Henry VI Part 3,8,5.1.13,SOMERSET,The drum your honour hears marcheth from Warwick.
12131,Henry VI Part 3,9,5.1.14,WARWICK,"Who should that be? belike, unlook'd-for friends."
12132,Henry VI Part 3,10,5.1.15,SOMERSET,"They are at hand, and you shall quickly know."

12136,Henry VI Part 3,13,5.1.18,WARWICK,O unbid spite! is sportful Edward come?
12137,Henry VI Part 3,13,5.1.19,WARWICK,"Where slept our scouts, or how are they seduced,"
12138,Henry VI Part 3,13,5.1.20,WARWICK,That we could hear no news of his repair?
12139,Henry VI Part 3,14,5.1.21,KING EDWARD IV,"Now, Warwick, wilt thou ope the city gates,"
12140,Henry VI Part 3,14,5.1.22,KING EDWARD IV,"Speak gentle words and humbly bend thy knee,"
12141,Henry VI Part 3,14,5.1.23,KING EDWARD IV,Call Edward king and at his hands beg mercy?
12142,Henry VI Part 3,14,5.1.24,KING EDWARD IV,And he shall pardon thee these outrages.
12143,Henry VI Part 3,15,5.1.25,WARWICK,"Nay, rather, wilt thou draw thy forces hence,"
12144,Henry VI Part 3,15,5.1.26,WARWICK,"Confess who set thee up and pluck'd thee own,"
12145,Henry VI Part 3,15,5.1.27,WARWICK,Call Warwick patron and be penitent?
12146,Henry VI Part 3,15,5.1.28,WARWICK,And thou shalt still remain the Duke of York.
12147,Henry VI Part 3,16,5.1.29,GLOUCESTER,"I thought, at least, he would have said the king,"
12148,Henry VI Part 3,16,5.1.30,GLOUCESTER,Or did he make the jest against his will?
12149,Henry VI Part 3,17,5.1.31,WARWICK,"Is not a dukedom, sir, a goodly gift?"
12150,Henry VI Part 3,18,5.1.32,GLOUCESTER,"Ay, by my faith, for a poor earl to give:"
12151,Henry VI Part 3,18,5.1.33,GLOUCESTER,I'll do thee service for so good a gift.
12152,Henry VI Part 3,19,5.1.34,WARWICK,'Twas I that gave the kingdom to thy brother.
12153,Henry VI Part 3,20,5.1.35,KING EDWARD IV,"Why then 'tis mine, if but by Warwick's gift."
12154,Henry VI Part 3,21,5.1.36,WARWICK,Thou art no Atlas for so great a weight:
12155,Henry VI Part 3,21,5.1.37,WARWICK,"And weakling, Warwick takes his gift again,"
12156,Henry VI Part 3,21,5.1.38,WARWICK,"And Henry is my king, Warwick his subject."
12157,Henry VI Part 3,22,5.1.39,KING EDWARD IV,But Warwick's king is Edward's prisoner:
12158,Henry VI Part 3,22,5.1.40,KING EDWARD IV,"And, gallant Warwick, do but answer this:"
12159,Henry VI Part 3,22,5.1.41,KING EDWARD IV,What is the body when the head is off?
12160,Henry VI Part 3,23,5.1.42,GLOUCESTER,"Alas, that Warwick had no more forecast,"
12161,Henry VI Part 3,23,5.1.43,GLOUCESTER,"But, whiles he thought to steal the single ten,"
12162,Henry VI Part 3,23,5.1.44,GLOUCESTER,The king was slily finger'd from the deck!
12163,Henry VI Part 3,23,5.1.45,GLOUCESTER,"You left poor Henry at the Bishop's palace,"
12164,Henry VI Part 3,23,5.1.46,GLOUCESTER,"And, ten to one, you'll meet him in the Tower."
12165,Henry VI Part 3,24,5.1.47,EDWARD,"'Tis even so, yet you are Warwick still."
12166,Henry VI Part 3,25,5.1.48,GLOUCESTER,"Come, Warwick, take the time, kneel down, kneel down:"
12167,Henry VI Part 3,25,5.1.49,GLOUCESTER,"Nay, when? strike now, or else the iron cools."
12168,Henry VI Part 3,26,5.1.50,WARWICK,"I had rather chop this hand off at a blow,"
12169,Henry VI Part 3,26,5.1.51,WARWICK,"And with the other fling it at thy face,"
12170,Henry VI Part 3,26,5.1.52,WARWICK,"Than bear so low a sail, to strike to thee."
12171,Henry VI Part 3,27,5.1.53,KING EDWARD IV,"Sail how thou canst, have wind and tide thy friend,"
12172,Henry VI Part 3,27,5.1.54,KING EDWARD IV,"This hand, fast wound about thy coal-black hair"
12173,Henry VI Part 3,27,5.1.55,KING EDWARD IV,"Shall, whiles thy head is warm and new cut off,"
12174,Henry VI Part 3,27,5.1.56,KING EDWARD IV,"Write in the dust this sentence with thy blood,"
12175,Henry VI Part 3,27,5.1.57,KING EDWARD IV,'Wind-changing Warwick now can change no more.'

12181,Henry VI Part 3,31,5.1.61,KING EDWARD IV,So other foes may set upon our backs.
12182,Henry VI Part 3,31,5.1.62,KING EDWARD IV,"Stand we in good array, for they no doubt"
12183,Henry VI Part 3,31,5.1.63,KING EDWARD IV,Will issue out again and bid us battle:
12184,Henry VI Part 3,31,5.1.64,KING EDWARD IV,"If not, the city being but of small defence,"
12185,Henry VI Part 3,31,5.1.65,KING EDWARD IV,We'll quickly rouse the traitors in the same.
12186,Henry VI Part 3,32,5.1.66,WARWICK,"O, welcome, Oxford! for we want thy help."
12187,Henry VI Part 3,32,,WARWICK,Enter MONTAGUE with drum and colours

12190,Henry VI Part 3,34,5.1.68,GLOUCESTER,Thou and thy brother both shall buy this treason
12191,Henry VI Part 3,34,5.1.69,GLOUCESTER,Even with the dearest blood your bodies bear.
12192,Henry VI Part 3,35,5.1.70,KING EDWARD IV,"The harder match'd, the greater victory:"
12193,Henry VI Part 3,35,5.1.71,KING EDWARD IV,My mind presageth happy gain and conquest.
12194,Henry VI Part 3,35,,KING EDWARD IV,"Enter SOMERSET, with drum and colours"
12195,Henry VI Part 3,36,5.1.72,SOMERSET,"Somerset, Somerset, for Lancaster!"
12196,Henry VI Part 3,36,,SOMERSET,He and his forces enter the city
12197,Henry VI Part 3,37,5.1.73,GLOUCESTER,"Two of thy name, both Dukes of Somerset,"
12198,Henry VI Part 3,37,5.1.74,GLOUCESTER,"Have sold their lives unto the house of York,"
12199,Henry VI Part 3,37,5.1.75,GLOUCESTER,And thou shalt be the third if this sword hold.
12200,Henry VI Part 3,37,,GLOUCESTER,"Enter CLARENCE, with drum and colours"
12201,Henry VI Part 3,38,5.1.76,WARWICK,"And lo, where George of Clarence sweeps along,"
12202,Henry VI Part 3,38,5.1.77,WARWICK,"Of force enough to bid his brother battle,"
12203,Henry VI Part 3,38,5.1.78,WARWICK,With whom an upright zeal to right prevails
12204,Henry VI Part 3,38,5.1.79,WARWICK,More than the nature of a brother's love!
12205,Henry VI Part 3,38,5.1.80,WARWICK,"Come, Clarence, come, thou wilt, if Warwick call."
12206,Henry VI Part 3,39,5.1.81,CLARENCE,"Father of Warwick, know you what this means?"
12207,Henry VI Part 3,39,,CLARENCE,Taking his red rose out of his hat
12208,Henry VI Part 3,39,5.1.82,CLARENCE,"Look here, I throw my infamy at thee"
12209,Henry VI Part 3,39,5.1.83,CLARENCE,"I will not ruinate my father's house,"
12210,Henry VI Part 3,39,5.1.84,CLARENCE,"Who gave his blood to lime the stones together,"
12211,Henry VI Part 3,39,5.1.85,CLARENCE,"And set up Lancaster. Why, trow'st thou, Warwick,"
12212,Henry VI Part 3,39,5.1.86,CLARENCE,"That Clarence is so harsh, so blunt, unnatural,"
12213,Henry VI Part 3,39,5.1.87,CLARENCE,To bend the fatal instruments of war
12214,Henry VI Part 3,39,5.1.88,CLARENCE,Against his brother and his lawful king?
12215,Henry VI Part 3,39,5.1.89,CLARENCE,Perhaps thou wilt object my holy oath:
12216,Henry VI Part 3,39,5.1.90,CLARENCE,To keep that oath were more impiety
12217,Henry VI Part 3,39,5.1.91,CLARENCE,"Than Jephthah's, when he sacrificed his daughter."
12218,Henry VI Part 3,39,5.1.92,CLARENCE,I am so sorry for my trespass made
12219,Henry VI Part 3,39,5.1.93,CLARENCE,"That, to deserve well at my brother's hands,"
12220,Henry VI Part 3,39,5.1.94,CLARENCE,"I here proclaim myself thy mortal foe,"
12221,Henry VI Part 3,39,5.1.95,CLARENCE,"With resolution, wheresoe'er I meet thee--"
12222,Henry VI Part 3,39,5.1.96,CLARENCE,"As I will meet thee, if thou stir abroad--"
12223,Henry VI Part 3,39,5.1.97,CLARENCE,To plague thee for thy foul misleading me.
12224,Henry VI Part 3,39,5.1.98,CLARENCE,"And so, proud-hearted Warwick, I defy thee,"
12225,Henry VI Part 3,39,5.1.99,CLARENCE,And to my brother turn my blushing cheeks.
12226,Henry VI Part 3,39,5.1.100,CLARENCE,"Pardon me, Edward, I will make amends:"
12227,Henry VI Part 3,39,5.1.101,CLARENCE,"And, Richard, do not frown upon my faults,"
12228,Henry VI Part 3,39,5.1.102,CLARENCE,For I will henceforth be no more unconstant.
12229,Henry VI Part 3,40,5.1.103,KING EDWARD IV,"Now welcome more, and ten times more beloved,"
12230,Henry VI Part 3,40,5.1.104,KING EDWARD IV,Than if thou never hadst deserved our hate.
12231,Henry VI Part 3,41,5.1.105,GLOUCESTER,"Welcome, good Clarence, this is brotherlike."
12232,Henry VI Part 3,42,5.1.106,WARWICK,"O passing traitor, perjured and unjust!"
12233,Henry VI Part 3,43,5.1.107,KING EDWARD IV,"What, Warwick, wilt thou leave the town and fight?"
12234,Henry VI Part 3,43,5.1.108,KING EDWARD IV,Or shall we beat the stones about thine ears?
12235,Henry VI Part 3,44,5.1.109,WARWICK,"Alas, I am not coop'd here for defence!"
12236,Henry VI Part 3,44,5.1.110,WARWICK,"I will away towards Barnet presently,"
12237,Henry VI Part 3,44,5.1.111,WARWICK,"And bid thee battle, Edward, if thou darest."
12238,Henry VI Part 3,45,5.1.112,KING EDWARD IV,"Yes, Warwick, Edward dares, and leads the way."
12239,Henry VI Part 3,45,5.1.113,KING EDWARD IV,"Lords, to the field, Saint George and victory!"
12240,Henry VI Part 3,45,,KING EDWARD IV,Exeunt King Edward and his company. March. Warwick and his company follow
12241,Henry VI Part 3,45,,KING EDWARD IV,SCENE II. A field of battle near Barnet.
12242,Henry VI Part 3,45,,KING EDWARD IV,"Alarum and excursions. Enter KING EDWARD IV, bringing forth WARWICK wounded"
12243,Henry VI Part 3,1,5.2.1,KING EDWARD IV,"So, lie thou there: die thou, and die our fear,"
12244,Henry VI Part 3,1,5.2.2,KING EDWARD IV,For Warwick was a bug that fear'd us all.
12245,Henry VI Part 3,1,5.2.3,KING EDWARD IV,"Now, Montague, sit fast, I seek for thee,"
12246,Henry VI Part 3,1,5.2.4,KING EDWARD IV,That Warwick's bones may keep thine company.
12247,Henry VI Part 3,1,,KING EDWARD IV,Exit
12248,Henry VI Part 3,2,5.2.5,WARWICK,"Ah, who is nigh? come to me, friend or foe,"
12249,Henry VI Part 3,2,5.2.6,WARWICK,"And tell me who is victor, York or Warwick?"
12250,Henry VI Part 3,2,5.2.7,WARWICK,"Why ask I that? my mangled body shows,"
12251,Henry VI Part 3,2,5.2.8,WARWICK,"My blood, my want of strength, my sick heart shows."
12252,Henry VI Part 3,2,5.2.9,WARWICK,That I must yield my body to the earth
12253,Henry VI Part 3,2,5.2.10,WARWICK,"And, by my fall, the conquest to my foe."
12254,Henry VI Part 3,2,5.2.11,WARWICK,"Thus yields the cedar to the axe's edge,"
12255,Henry VI Part 3,2,5.2.12,WARWICK,"Whose arms gave shelter to the princely eagle,"
12256,Henry VI Part 3,2,5.2.13,WARWICK,"Under whose shade the ramping lion slept,"
12257,Henry VI Part 3,2,5.2.14,WARWICK,Whose top-branch overpeer'd Jove's spreading tree
12258,Henry VI Part 3,2,5.2.15,WARWICK,And kept low shrubs from winter's powerful wind.
12259,Henry VI Part 3,2,5.2.16,WARWICK,"These eyes, that now are dimm'd with death's black veil,"
12260,Henry VI Part 3,2,5.2.17,WARWICK,"Have been as piercing as the mid-day sun,"
12261,Henry VI Part 3,2,5.2.18,WARWICK,To search the secret treasons of the world:
12262,Henry VI Part 3,2,5.2.19,WARWICK,"The wrinkles in my brows, now filled with blood,"
12263,Henry VI Part 3,2,5.2.20,WARWICK,"Were liken'd oft to kingly sepulchres,"
12264,Henry VI Part 3,2,5.2.21,WARWICK,"For who lived king, but I could dig his grave?"
12265,Henry VI Part 3,2,5.2.22,WARWICK,And who durst mine when Warwick bent his brow?
12266,Henry VI Part 3,2,5.2.23,WARWICK,"Lo, now my glory smear'd in dust and blood!"
12267,Henry VI Part 3,2,5.2.24,WARWICK,"My parks, my walks, my manors that I had."
12268,Henry VI Part 3,2,5.2.25,WARWICK,"Even now forsake me, and of all my lands"
12269,Henry VI Part 3,2,5.2.26,WARWICK,Is nothing left me but my body's length.
12270,Henry VI Part 3,2,5.2.27,WARWICK,"Why, what is pomp, rule, reign, but earth and dust?"
12271,Henry VI Part 3,2,5.2.28,WARWICK,"And, live we how we can, yet die we must."
12272,Henry VI Part 3,2,,WARWICK,Enter OXFORD and SOMERSET
12273,Henry VI Part 3,3,5.2.29,SOMERSET,"Ah, Warwick, Warwick! wert thou as we are."
12274,Henry VI Part 3,3,5.2.30,SOMERSET,"We might recover all our loss again,"
12275,Henry VI Part 3,3,5.2.31,SOMERSET,The queen from France hath brought a puissant power:
12276,Henry VI Part 3,3,5.2.32,SOMERSET,"Even now we heard the news: ah, could'st thou fly!"
12277,Henry VI Part 3,4,5.2.33,WARWICK,"Why, then I would not fly. Ah, Montague,"
12278,Henry VI Part 3,4,5.2.34,WARWICK,"If thou be there, sweet brother, take my hand."
12279,Henry VI Part 3,4,5.2.35,WARWICK,And with thy lips keep in my soul awhile!
12280,Henry VI Part 3,4,5.2.36,WARWICK,"Thou lovest me not, for, brother, if thou didst,"
12281,Henry VI Part 3,4,5.2.37,WARWICK,Thy tears would wash this cold congealed blood
12282,Henry VI Part 3,4,5.2.38,WARWICK,That glues my lips and will not let me speak.
12283,Henry VI Part 3,4,5.2.39,WARWICK,"Come quickly, Montague, or I am dead."
12284,Henry VI Part 3,5,5.2.40,SOMERSET,"Ah, Warwick! Montague hath breathed his last,"
12285,Henry VI Part 3,5,5.2.41,SOMERSET,"And to the latest gasp cried out for Warwick,"
12286,Henry VI Part 3,5,5.2.42,SOMERSET,And said 'Commend me to my valiant brother.'
12287,Henry VI Part 3,5,5.2.43,SOMERSET,"And more he would have said, and more he spoke,"
12288,Henry VI Part 3,5,5.2.44,SOMERSET,"Which sounded like a clamour in a vault,"
12289,Henry VI Part 3,5,5.2.45,SOMERSET,"That mought not be distinguished, but at last"
12290,Henry VI Part 3,5,5.2.46,SOMERSET,"I well might hear, delivered with a groan,"
12291,Henry VI Part 3,5,5.2.47,SOMERSET,"'O, farewell, Warwick!'"
12292,Henry VI Part 3,6,5.2.48,WARWICK,"Sweet rest his soul! Fly, lords, and save yourselves,"
12293,Henry VI Part 3,6,5.2.49,WARWICK,For Warwick bids you all farewell to meet in heaven.
12294,Henry VI Part 3,6,,WARWICK,Dies
12295,Henry VI Part 3,7,5.2.50,OXFORD,"Away, away, to meet the queen's great power!"

12299,Henry VI Part 3,1,5.3.1,KING EDWARD IV,"Thus far our fortune keeps an upward course,"
12300,Henry VI Part 3,1,5.3.2,KING EDWARD IV,And we are graced with wreaths of victory.
12301,Henry VI Part 3,1,5.3.3,KING EDWARD IV,"But, in the midst of this bright-shining day,"
12302,Henry VI Part 3,1,5.3.4,KING EDWARD IV,"I spy a black, suspicious, threatening cloud,"
12303,Henry VI Part 3,1,5.3.5,KING EDWARD IV,"That will encounter with our glorious sun,"
12304,Henry VI Part 3,1,5.3.6,KING EDWARD IV,Ere he attain his easeful western bed:
12305,Henry VI Part 3,1,5.3.7,KING EDWARD IV,"I mean, my lords, those powers that the queen"
12306,Henry VI Part 3,1,5.3.8,KING EDWARD IV,Hath raised in Gallia have arrived our coast
12307,Henry VI Part 3,1,5.3.9,KING EDWARD IV,"And, as we hear, march on to fight with us."
12308,Henry VI Part 3,2,5.3.10,CLARENCE,A little gale will soon disperse that cloud
12309,Henry VI Part 3,2,5.3.11,CLARENCE,And blow it to the source from whence it came:
12310,Henry VI Part 3,2,5.3.12,CLARENCE,"The very beams will dry those vapours up,"
12311,Henry VI Part 3,2,5.3.13,CLARENCE,For every cloud engenders not a storm.
12312,Henry VI Part 3,3,5.3.14,GLOUCESTER,"The queen is valued thirty thousand strong,"
12313,Henry VI Part 3,3,5.3.15,GLOUCESTER,"And Somerset, with Oxford fled to her:"
12314,Henry VI Part 3,3,5.3.16,GLOUCESTER,If she have time to breathe be well assured
12315,Henry VI Part 3,3,5.3.17,GLOUCESTER,Her faction will be full as strong as ours.
12316,Henry VI Part 3,4,5.3.18,KING EDWARD IV,We are advertised by our loving friends
12317,Henry VI Part 3,4,5.3.19,KING EDWARD IV,That they do hold their course toward Tewksbury:
12318,Henry VI Part 3,4,5.3.20,KING EDWARD IV,"We, having now the best at Barnet field,"
12319,Henry VI Part 3,4,5.3.21,KING EDWARD IV,"Will thither straight, for willingness rids way,"
12320,Henry VI Part 3,4,5.3.22,KING EDWARD IV,"And, as we march, our strength will be augmented"
12321,Henry VI Part 3,4,5.3.23,KING EDWARD IV,In every county as we go along.

12325,Henry VI Part 3,4,,KING EDWARD IV,"March. Enter QUEEN MARGARET, PRINCE EDWARD, SOMERSET, OXFORD, and soldiers"
12326,Henry VI Part 3,1,5.4.1,QUEEN MARGARET,"Great lords, wise men ne'er sit and wail their loss,"
12327,Henry VI Part 3,1,5.4.2,QUEEN MARGARET,But cheerly seek how to redress their harms.
12328,Henry VI Part 3,1,5.4.3,QUEEN MARGARET,"What though the mast be now blown overboard,"
12329,Henry VI Part 3,1,5.4.4,QUEEN MARGARET,"The cable broke, the holding-anchor lost,"
12330,Henry VI Part 3,1,5.4.5,QUEEN MARGARET,And half our sailors swallow'd in the flood?
12331,Henry VI Part 3,1,5.4.6,QUEEN MARGARET,Yet lives our pilot still. Is't meet that he
12332,Henry VI Part 3,1,5.4.7,QUEEN MARGARET,Should leave the helm and like a fearful lad
12333,Henry VI Part 3,1,5.4.8,QUEEN MARGARET,With tearful eyes add water to the sea
12334,Henry VI Part 3,1,5.4.9,QUEEN MARGARET,"And give more strength to that which hath too much,"
12335,Henry VI Part 3,1,5.4.10,QUEEN MARGARET,"Whiles, in his moan, the ship splits on the rock,"
12336,Henry VI Part 3,1,5.4.11,QUEEN MARGARET,Which industry and courage might have saved?
12337,Henry VI Part 3,1,5.4.12,QUEEN MARGARET,"Ah, what a shame! ah, what a fault were this!"
12338,Henry VI Part 3,1,5.4.13,QUEEN MARGARET,"Say Warwick was our anchor, what of that?"
12339,Henry VI Part 3,1,5.4.14,QUEEN MARGARET,"And Montague our topmost, what of him?"
12340,Henry VI Part 3,1,5.4.15,QUEEN MARGARET,"Our slaughter'd friends the tackles, what of these?"
12341,Henry VI Part 3,1,5.4.16,QUEEN MARGARET,"Why, is not Oxford here another anchor?"
12342,Henry VI Part 3,1,5.4.17,QUEEN MARGARET,And Somerset another goodly mast?
12343,Henry VI Part 3,1,5.4.18,QUEEN MARGARET,The friends of France our shrouds and tacklings?
12344,Henry VI Part 3,1,5.4.19,QUEEN MARGARET,"And, though unskilful, why not Ned and I"
12345,Henry VI Part 3,1,5.4.20,QUEEN MARGARET,For once allow'd the skilful pilot's charge?
12346,Henry VI Part 3,1,5.4.21,QUEEN MARGARET,"We will not from the helm to sit and weep,"
12347,Henry VI Part 3,1,5.4.22,QUEEN MARGARET,"But keep our course, though the rough wind say no,"
12348,Henry VI Part 3,1,5.4.23,QUEEN MARGARET,From shelves and rocks that threaten us with wreck.
12349,Henry VI Part 3,1,5.4.24,QUEEN MARGARET,As good to chide the waves as speak them fair.
12350,Henry VI Part 3,1,5.4.25,QUEEN MARGARET,And what is Edward but ruthless sea?
12351,Henry VI Part 3,1,5.4.26,QUEEN MARGARET,What Clarence but a quicksand of deceit?
12352,Henry VI Part 3,1,5.4.27,QUEEN MARGARET,And Richard but a ragged fatal rock?
12353,Henry VI Part 3,1,5.4.28,QUEEN MARGARET,All these the enemies to our poor bark.
12354,Henry VI Part 3,1,5.4.29,QUEEN MARGARET,"Say you can swim, alas, 'tis but a while!"
12355,Henry VI Part 3,1,5.4.30,QUEEN MARGARET,"Tread on the sand, why, there you quickly sink:"
12356,Henry VI Part 3,1,5.4.31,QUEEN MARGARET,"Bestride the rock, the tide will wash you off,"
12357,Henry VI Part 3,1,5.4.32,QUEEN MARGARET,"Or else you famish, that's a threefold death."
12358,Henry VI Part 3,1,5.4.33,QUEEN MARGARET,"This speak I, lords, to let you understand,"
12359,Henry VI Part 3,1,5.4.34,QUEEN MARGARET,"If case some one of you would fly from us,"
12360,Henry VI Part 3,1,5.4.35,QUEEN MARGARET,That there's no hoped-for mercy with the brothers
12361,Henry VI Part 3,1,5.4.36,QUEEN MARGARET,"More than with ruthless waves, with sands and rocks."
12362,Henry VI Part 3,1,5.4.37,QUEEN MARGARET,"Why, courage then! what cannot be avoided"
12363,Henry VI Part 3,1,5.4.38,QUEEN MARGARET,'Twere childish weakness to lament or fear.
12364,Henry VI Part 3,2,5.4.39,PRINCE EDWARD,Methinks a woman of this valiant spirit

12366,Henry VI Part 3,2,5.4.41,PRINCE EDWARD,Infuse his breast with magnanimity
12367,Henry VI Part 3,2,5.4.42,PRINCE EDWARD,"And make him, naked, foil a man at arms."
12368,Henry VI Part 3,2,5.4.43,PRINCE EDWARD,I speak not this as doubting any here
12369,Henry VI Part 3,2,5.4.44,PRINCE EDWARD,For did I but suspect a fearful man
12370,Henry VI Part 3,2,5.4.45,PRINCE EDWARD,"He should have leave to go away betimes,"
12371,Henry VI Part 3,2,5.4.46,PRINCE EDWARD,Lest in our need he might infect another
12372,Henry VI Part 3,2,5.4.47,PRINCE EDWARD,And make him of like spirit to himself.
12373,Henry VI Part 3,2,5.4.48,PRINCE EDWARD,If any such be here--as God forbid!--
12374,Henry VI Part 3,2,5.4.49,PRINCE EDWARD,Let him depart before we need his help.
12375,Henry VI Part 3,3,5.4.50,OXFORD,"Women and children of so high a courage,"
12376,Henry VI Part 3,3,5.4.51,OXFORD,"And warriors faint! why, 'twere perpetual shame."
12377,Henry VI Part 3,3,5.4.52,OXFORD,O brave young prince! thy famous grandfather
12378,Henry VI Part 3,3,5.4.53,OXFORD,Doth live again in thee: long mayst thou live
12379,Henry VI Part 3,3,5.4.54,OXFORD,To bear his image and renew his glories!
12380,Henry VI Part 3,4,5.4.55,SOMERSET,And he that will not fight for such a hope.
12381,Henry VI Part 3,4,5.4.56,SOMERSET,"Go home to bed, and like the owl by day,"
12382,Henry VI Part 3,4,5.4.57,SOMERSET,"If he arise, be mock'd and wonder'd at."
12383,Henry VI Part 3,5,5.4.58,QUEEN MARGARET,"Thanks, gentle Somerset, sweet Oxford, thanks."
12384,Henry VI Part 3,6,5.4.59,PRINCE EDWARD,And take his thanks that yet hath nothing else.
12385,Henry VI Part 3,6,,PRINCE EDWARD,Enter a Messenger
12386,Henry VI Part 3,7,5.4.60,Messenger,"Prepare you, lords, for Edward is at hand."
12387,Henry VI Part 3,7,5.4.61,Messenger,"Ready to fight, therefore be resolute."
12388,Henry VI Part 3,8,5.4.62,OXFORD,I thought no less: it is his policy
12389,Henry VI Part 3,8,5.4.63,OXFORD,"To haste thus fast, to find us unprovided."
12390,Henry VI Part 3,9,5.4.64,SOMERSET,"But he's deceived, we are in readiness."
12391,Henry VI Part 3,10,5.4.65,QUEEN MARGARET,"This cheers my heart, to see your forwardness."

12395,Henry VI Part 3,12,5.4.68,KING EDWARD IV,"Which, by the heavens' assistance and your strength,"
12396,Henry VI Part 3,12,5.4.69,KING EDWARD IV,Must by the roots be hewn up yet ere night.
12397,Henry VI Part 3,12,5.4.70,KING EDWARD IV,"I need not add more fuel to your fire,"
12398,Henry VI Part 3,12,5.4.71,KING EDWARD IV,For well I wot ye blaze to burn them out
12399,Henry VI Part 3,12,5.4.72,KING EDWARD IV,"Give signal to the fight, and to it, lords!"

12406,Henry VI Part 3,13,5.4.79,QUEEN MARGARET,"His statutes cancell'd and his treasure spent,"
12407,Henry VI Part 3,13,5.4.80,QUEEN MARGARET,And yonder is the wolf that makes this spoil.
12408,Henry VI Part 3,13,5.4.81,QUEEN MARGARET,"You fight in justice: then, in God's name, lords,"
12409,Henry VI Part 3,13,5.4.82,QUEEN MARGARET,Be valiant and give signal to the fight.

12414,Henry VI Part 3,1,5.5.2,KING EDWARD IV,Away with Oxford to Hames Castle straight:
12415,Henry VI Part 3,1,5.5.3,KING EDWARD IV,"For Somerset, off with his guilty head."

12421,Henry VI Part 3,4,5.5.8,QUEEN MARGARET,To meet with joy in sweet Jerusalem.
12422,Henry VI Part 3,5,5.5.9,KING EDWARD IV,"Is proclamation made, that who finds Edward"
12423,Henry VI Part 3,5,5.5.10,KING EDWARD IV,"Shall have a high reward, and he his life?"
12424,Henry VI Part 3,6,5.5.11,GLOUCESTER,"It is: and lo, where youthful Edward comes!"
12425,Henry VI Part 3,6,,GLOUCESTER,"Enter soldiers, with PRINCE EDWARD"
12426,Henry VI Part 3,7,5.5.12,KING EDWARD IV,"Bring forth the gallant, let us hear him speak."
12427,Henry VI Part 3,7,5.5.13,KING EDWARD IV,What! can so young a thorn begin to prick?
12428,Henry VI Part 3,7,5.5.14,KING EDWARD IV,"Edward, what satisfaction canst thou make"
12429,Henry VI Part 3,7,5.5.15,KING EDWARD IV,"For bearing arms, for stirring up my subjects,"
12430,Henry VI Part 3,7,5.5.16,KING EDWARD IV,And all the trouble thou hast turn'd me to?
12431,Henry VI Part 3,8,5.5.17,PRINCE EDWARD,"Speak like a subject, proud ambitious York!"
12432,Henry VI Part 3,8,5.5.18,PRINCE EDWARD,"Suppose that I am now my father's mouth,"
12433,Henry VI Part 3,8,5.5.19,PRINCE EDWARD,"Resign thy chair, and where I stand kneel thou,"
12434,Henry VI Part 3,8,5.5.20,PRINCE EDWARD,"Whilst I propose the selfsame words to thee,"
12435,Henry VI Part 3,8,5.5.21,PRINCE EDWARD,"Which traitor, thou wouldst have me answer to."
12436,Henry VI Part 3,9,5.5.22,QUEEN MARGARET,"Ah, that thy father had been so resolved!"
12437,Henry VI Part 3,10,5.5.23,GLOUCESTER,"That you might still have worn the petticoat,"
12438,Henry VI Part 3,10,5.5.24,GLOUCESTER,And ne'er have stol'n the breech from Lancaster.
12439,Henry VI Part 3,11,5.5.25,PRINCE EDWARD,"Let AEsop fable in a winter's night,"
12440,Henry VI Part 3,11,5.5.26,PRINCE EDWARD,His currish riddles sort not with this place.
12441,Henry VI Part 3,12,5.5.27,GLOUCESTER,"By heaven, brat, I'll plague ye for that word."
12442,Henry VI Part 3,13,5.5.28,QUEEN MARGARET,"Ay, thou wast born to be a plague to men."
12443,Henry VI Part 3,14,5.5.29,GLOUCESTER,"For God's sake, take away this captive scold."
12444,Henry VI Part 3,15,5.5.30,PRINCE EDWARD,"Nay, take away this scolding crookback rather."
12445,Henry VI Part 3,16,5.5.31,KING EDWARD IV,"Peace, wilful boy, or I will charm your tongue."
12446,Henry VI Part 3,17,5.5.32,CLARENCE,"Untutor'd lad, thou art too malapert."
12447,Henry VI Part 3,18,5.5.33,PRINCE EDWARD,"I know my duty, you are all undutiful:"
12448,Henry VI Part 3,18,5.5.34,PRINCE EDWARD,"Lascivious Edward, and thou perjured George,"
12449,Henry VI Part 3,18,5.5.35,PRINCE EDWARD,"And thou mis-shapen Dick, I tell ye all"
12450,Henry VI Part 3,18,5.5.36,PRINCE EDWARD,"I am your better, traitors as ye are:"
12451,Henry VI Part 3,18,5.5.37,PRINCE EDWARD,And thou usurp'st my father's right and mine.
12452,Henry VI Part 3,19,5.5.38,KING EDWARD IV,"Take that, thou likeness of this railer here."
12453,Henry VI Part 3,19,,KING EDWARD IV,Stabs him
12454,Henry VI Part 3,20,5.5.39,GLOUCESTER,"Sprawl'st thou? take that, to end thy agony."
12455,Henry VI Part 3,20,,GLOUCESTER,Stabs him
12456,Henry VI Part 3,21,5.5.40,CLARENCE,And there's for twitting me with perjury.
12457,Henry VI Part 3,21,,CLARENCE,Stabs him
12458,Henry VI Part 3,22,5.5.41,QUEEN MARGARET,"O, kill me too!"
12459,Henry VI Part 3,23,5.5.42,GLOUCESTER,"Marry, and shall."

12462,Henry VI Part 3,25,5.5.44,GLOUCESTER,"Why should she live, to fill the world with words?"
12463,Henry VI Part 3,26,5.5.45,KING EDWARD IV,"What, doth she swoon? use means for her recovery."
12464,Henry VI Part 3,27,5.5.46,GLOUCESTER,"Clarence, excuse me to the king my brother,"
12465,Henry VI Part 3,27,5.5.47,GLOUCESTER,I'll hence to London on a serious matter:
12466,Henry VI Part 3,27,5.5.48,GLOUCESTER,"Ere ye come there, be sure to hear some news."
12467,Henry VI Part 3,28,5.5.49,CLARENCE,What? what?
12468,Henry VI Part 3,29,5.5.50,GLOUCESTER,"The Tower, the Tower."

12470,Henry VI Part 3,30,5.5.51,QUEEN MARGARET,"O Ned, sweet Ned! speak to thy mother, boy!"
12471,Henry VI Part 3,30,5.5.52,QUEEN MARGARET,Canst thou not speak? O traitors! murderers!
12472,Henry VI Part 3,30,5.5.53,QUEEN MARGARET,"They that stabb'd Caesar shed no blood at all,"
12473,Henry VI Part 3,30,5.5.54,QUEEN MARGARET,"Did not offend, nor were not worthy blame,"
12474,Henry VI Part 3,30,5.5.55,QUEEN MARGARET,If this foul deed were by to equal it:
12475,Henry VI Part 3,30,5.5.56,QUEEN MARGARET,"He was a man, this, in respect, a child:"
12476,Henry VI Part 3,30,5.5.57,QUEEN MARGARET,And men ne'er spend their fury on a child.
12477,Henry VI Part 3,30,5.5.58,QUEEN MARGARET,"What's worse than murderer, that I may name it?"
12478,Henry VI Part 3,30,5.5.59,QUEEN MARGARET,"No, no, my heart will burst, and if I speak:"
12479,Henry VI Part 3,30,5.5.60,QUEEN MARGARET,"And I will speak, that so my heart may burst."
12480,Henry VI Part 3,30,5.5.61,QUEEN MARGARET,Butchers and villains! bloody cannibals!
12481,Henry VI Part 3,30,5.5.62,QUEEN MARGARET,How sweet a plant have you untimely cropp'd!
12482,Henry VI Part 3,30,5.5.63,QUEEN MARGARET,"You have no children, butchers! if you had,"
12483,Henry VI Part 3,30,5.5.64,QUEEN MARGARET,The thought of them would have stirr'd up remorse:
12484,Henry VI Part 3,30,5.5.65,QUEEN MARGARET,"But if you ever chance to have a child,"
12485,Henry VI Part 3,30,5.5.66,QUEEN MARGARET,Look in his youth to have him so cut off
12486,Henry VI Part 3,30,5.5.67,QUEEN MARGARET,"As, deathmen, you have rid this sweet young prince!"
12487,Henry VI Part 3,31,5.5.68,KING EDWARD IV,"Away with her, go, bear her hence perforce."
12488,Henry VI Part 3,32,5.5.69,QUEEN MARGARET,"Nay, never bear me hence, dispatch me here,"
12489,Henry VI Part 3,32,5.5.70,QUEEN MARGARET,"Here sheathe thy sword, I'll pardon thee my death:"
12490,Henry VI Part 3,32,5.5.71,QUEEN MARGARET,"What, wilt thou not? then, Clarence, do it thou."
12491,Henry VI Part 3,33,5.5.72,CLARENCE,"By heaven, I will not do thee so much ease."
12492,Henry VI Part 3,34,5.5.73,QUEEN MARGARET,"Good Clarence, do, sweet Clarence, do thou do it."
12493,Henry VI Part 3,35,5.5.74,CLARENCE,Didst thou not hear me swear I would not do it?
12494,Henry VI Part 3,36,5.5.75,QUEEN MARGARET,"Ay, but thou usest to forswear thyself:"
12495,Henry VI Part 3,36,5.5.76,QUEEN MARGARET,"'Twas sin before, but now 'tis charity."
12496,Henry VI Part 3,36,5.5.77,QUEEN MARGARET,"What, wilt thou not? Where is that devil's butcher,"
12497,Henry VI Part 3,36,5.5.78,QUEEN MARGARET,"Hard-favour'd Richard? Richard, where art thou?"
12498,Henry VI Part 3,36,5.5.79,QUEEN MARGARET,"Thou art not here: murder is thy alms-deed,"
12499,Henry VI Part 3,36,5.5.80,QUEEN MARGARET,Petitioners for blood thou ne'er put'st back.
12500,Henry VI Part 3,37,5.5.81,KING EDWARD IV,"Away, I say, I charge ye, bear her hence."
12501,Henry VI Part 3,38,5.5.82,QUEEN MARGARET,"So come to you and yours, as to this Prince!"
12502,Henry VI Part 3,38,,QUEEN MARGARET,"Exit, led out forcibly"
12503,Henry VI Part 3,39,5.5.83,KING EDWARD IV,Where's Richard gone?
12504,Henry VI Part 3,40,5.5.84,CLARENCE,"To London, all in post, and, as I guess,"
12505,Henry VI Part 3,40,5.5.85,CLARENCE,To make a bloody supper in the Tower.
12506,Henry VI Part 3,41,5.5.86,KING EDWARD IV,"He's sudden, if a thing comes in his head."
12507,Henry VI Part 3,41,5.5.87,KING EDWARD IV,Now march we hence: discharge the common sort
12508,Henry VI Part 3,41,5.5.88,KING EDWARD IV,"With pay and thanks, and let's away to London"
12509,Henry VI Part 3,41,5.5.89,KING EDWARD IV,And see our gentle queen how well she fares:
12510,Henry VI Part 3,41,5.5.90,KING EDWARD IV,"By this, I hope, she hath a son for me."
12511,Henry VI Part 3,41,,KING EDWARD IV,Exeunt

12514,Henry VI Part 3,1,5.6.1,GLOUCESTER,"Good day, my lord. What, at your book so hard?"
12515,Henry VI Part 3,2,5.6.2,KING HENRY VI,"Ay, my good lord:--my lord, I should say rather,"
12516,Henry VI Part 3,2,5.6.3,KING HENRY VI,"'Tis sin to flatter, 'good' was little better:"
12517,Henry VI Part 3,2,5.6.4,KING HENRY VI,"'Good Gloucester' and 'good devil' were alike,"
12518,Henry VI Part 3,2,5.6.5,KING HENRY VI,"And both preposterous, therefore, not 'good lord.'"
12519,Henry VI Part 3,3,5.6.6,GLOUCESTER,"Sirrah, leave us to ourselves: we must confer."
12520,Henry VI Part 3,3,,GLOUCESTER,Exit Lieutenant
12521,Henry VI Part 3,4,5.6.7,KING HENRY VI,"So flies the reckless shepherd from the wolf,"
12522,Henry VI Part 3,4,5.6.8,KING HENRY VI,So first the harmless sheep doth yield his fleece
12523,Henry VI Part 3,4,5.6.9,KING HENRY VI,And next his throat unto the butcher's knife.
12524,Henry VI Part 3,4,5.6.10,KING HENRY VI,What scene of death hath Roscius now to act?
12525,Henry VI Part 3,5,5.6.11,GLOUCESTER,"Suspicion always haunts the guilty mind,"

12530,Henry VI Part 3,6,5.6.16,KING HENRY VI,Have now the fatal object in my eye
12531,Henry VI Part 3,6,5.6.17,KING HENRY VI,"Where my poor young was limed, was caught and kill'd."
12532,Henry VI Part 3,7,5.6.18,GLOUCESTER,"Why, what a peevish fool was that of Crete,"
12533,Henry VI Part 3,7,5.6.19,GLOUCESTER,That taught his son the office of a fowl!
12534,Henry VI Part 3,7,5.6.20,GLOUCESTER,"An yet, for all his wings, the fool was drown'd."
12535,Henry VI Part 3,8,5.6.21,KING HENRY VI,"I, Daedalus, my poor boy, Icarus,"

12538,Henry VI Part 3,8,5.6.24,KING HENRY VI,"Thy brother Edward, and thyself the sea"
12539,Henry VI Part 3,8,5.6.25,KING HENRY VI,Whose envious gulf did swallow up his life.
12540,Henry VI Part 3,8,5.6.26,KING HENRY VI,"Ah, kill me with thy weapon, not with words!"
12541,Henry VI Part 3,8,5.6.27,KING HENRY VI,My breast can better brook thy dagger's point
12542,Henry VI Part 3,8,5.6.28,KING HENRY VI,Than can my ears that tragic history.
12543,Henry VI Part 3,8,5.6.29,KING HENRY VI,But wherefore dost thou come? is't for my life?
12544,Henry VI Part 3,9,5.6.30,GLOUCESTER,Think'st thou I am an executioner?
12545,Henry VI Part 3,10,5.6.31,KING HENRY VI,"A persecutor, I am sure, thou art:"
12546,Henry VI Part 3,10,5.6.32,KING HENRY VI,"If murdering innocents be executing,"
12547,Henry VI Part 3,10,5.6.33,KING HENRY VI,"Why, then thou art an executioner."
12548,Henry VI Part 3,11,5.6.34,GLOUCESTER,Thy son I kill'd for his presumption.
12549,Henry VI Part 3,12,5.6.35,KING HENRY VI,"Hadst thou been kill'd when first thou didst presume,"
12550,Henry VI Part 3,12,5.6.36,KING HENRY VI,Thou hadst not lived to kill a son of mine.
12551,Henry VI Part 3,12,5.6.37,KING HENRY VI,"And thus I prophesy, that many a thousand,"
12552,Henry VI Part 3,12,5.6.38,KING HENRY VI,"Which now mistrust no parcel of my fear,"
12553,Henry VI Part 3,12,5.6.39,KING HENRY VI,"And many an old man's sigh and many a widow's,"
12554,Henry VI Part 3,12,5.6.40,KING HENRY VI,And many an orphan's water-standing eye--
12555,Henry VI Part 3,12,5.6.41,KING HENRY VI,"Men for their sons, wives for their husbands,"
12556,Henry VI Part 3,12,5.6.42,KING HENRY VI,And orphans for their parents timeless death--
12557,Henry VI Part 3,12,5.6.43,KING HENRY VI,Shall rue the hour that ever thou wast born.
12558,Henry VI Part 3,12,5.6.44,KING HENRY VI,"The owl shriek'd at thy birth,--an evil sign,"
12559,Henry VI Part 3,12,5.6.45,KING HENRY VI,"The night-crow cried, aboding luckless time,"

12563,Henry VI Part 3,12,5.6.49,KING HENRY VI,"Thy mother felt more than a mother's pain,"
12564,Henry VI Part 3,12,5.6.50,KING HENRY VI,"And, yet brought forth less than a mother's hope,"
12565,Henry VI Part 3,12,5.6.51,KING HENRY VI,"To wit, an indigested and deformed lump,"
12566,Henry VI Part 3,12,5.6.52,KING HENRY VI,Not like the fruit of such a goodly tree.
12567,Henry VI Part 3,12,5.6.53,KING HENRY VI,"Teeth hadst thou in thy head when thou wast born,"
12568,Henry VI Part 3,12,5.6.54,KING HENRY VI,To signify thou camest to bite the world:
12569,Henry VI Part 3,12,5.6.55,KING HENRY VI,"And, if the rest be true which I have heard,"
12570,Henry VI Part 3,12,5.6.56,KING HENRY VI,Thou camest--
12571,Henry VI Part 3,13,5.6.57,GLOUCESTER,"I'll hear no more: die, prophet in thy speech:"
12572,Henry VI Part 3,13,,GLOUCESTER,Stabs him

12578,Henry VI Part 3,15,5.6.62,GLOUCESTER,Sink in the ground? I thought it would have mounted.
12579,Henry VI Part 3,15,5.6.63,GLOUCESTER,See how my sword weeps for the poor king's death!
12580,Henry VI Part 3,15,5.6.64,GLOUCESTER,"O, may such purple tears be alway shed"
12581,Henry VI Part 3,15,5.6.65,GLOUCESTER,From those that wish the downfall of our house!
12582,Henry VI Part 3,15,5.6.66,GLOUCESTER,"If any spark of life be yet remaining,"
12583,Henry VI Part 3,15,5.6.67,GLOUCESTER,"Down, down to hell, and say I sent thee thither:"
12584,Henry VI Part 3,15,,GLOUCESTER,Stabs him again
12585,Henry VI Part 3,15,5.6.68,GLOUCESTER,"I, that have neither pity, love, nor fear."
12586,Henry VI Part 3,15,5.6.69,GLOUCESTER,"Indeed, 'tis true that Henry told me of,"
12587,Henry VI Part 3,15,5.6.70,GLOUCESTER,For I have often heard my mother say
12588,Henry VI Part 3,15,5.6.71,GLOUCESTER,I came into the world with my legs forward:
12589,Henry VI Part 3,15,5.6.72,GLOUCESTER,"Had I not reason, think ye, to make haste,"
12590,Henry VI Part 3,15,5.6.73,GLOUCESTER,And seek their ruin that usurp'd our right?
12591,Henry VI Part 3,15,5.6.74,GLOUCESTER,The midwife wonder'd and the women cried
12592,Henry VI Part 3,15,5.6.75,GLOUCESTER,"'O, Jesus bless us, he is born with teeth!'"
12593,Henry VI Part 3,15,5.6.76,GLOUCESTER,"And so I was, which plainly signified"
12594,Henry VI Part 3,15,5.6.77,GLOUCESTER,That I should snarl and bite and play the dog.
12595,Henry VI Part 3,15,5.6.78,GLOUCESTER,"Then, since the heavens have shaped my body so,"
12596,Henry VI Part 3,15,5.6.79,GLOUCESTER,Let hell make crook'd my mind to answer it.
12597,Henry VI Part 3,15,5.6.80,GLOUCESTER,"I have no brother, I am like no brother,"
12598,Henry VI Part 3,15,5.6.81,GLOUCESTER,"And this word 'love,' which graybeards call divine,"
12599,Henry VI Part 3,15,5.6.82,GLOUCESTER,Be resident in men like one another
12600,Henry VI Part 3,15,5.6.83,GLOUCESTER,And not in me: I am myself alone.
12601,Henry VI Part 3,15,5.6.84,GLOUCESTER,"Clarence, beware, thou keep'st me from the light:"
12602,Henry VI Part 3,15,5.6.85,GLOUCESTER,"But I will sort a pitchy day for thee,"
12603,Henry VI Part 3,15,5.6.86,GLOUCESTER,For I will buz abroad such prophecies
12604,Henry VI Part 3,15,5.6.87,GLOUCESTER,"That Edward shall be fearful of his life,"
12605,Henry VI Part 3,15,5.6.88,GLOUCESTER,"And then, to purge his fear, I'll be thy death."
12606,Henry VI Part 3,15,5.6.89,GLOUCESTER,King Henry and the prince his son are gone:
12607,Henry VI Part 3,15,5.6.90,GLOUCESTER,"Clarence, thy turn is next, and then the rest,"
12608,Henry VI Part 3,15,5.6.91,GLOUCESTER,Counting myself but bad till I be best.
12609,Henry VI Part 3,15,5.6.92,GLOUCESTER,I'll throw thy body in another room
12610,Henry VI Part 3,15,5.6.93,GLOUCESTER,"And triumph, Henry, in thy day of doom."

12625,Henry VI Part 3,1,5.7.12,KING EDWARD IV,And made the forest tremble when they roar'd.
12626,Henry VI Part 3,1,5.7.13,KING EDWARD IV,Thus have we swept suspicion from our seat
12627,Henry VI Part 3,1,5.7.14,KING EDWARD IV,And made our footstool of security.
12628,Henry VI Part 3,1,5.7.15,KING EDWARD IV,"Come hither, Bess, and let me kiss my boy."

12641,Henry VI Part 3,4,5.7.28,CLARENCE,The duty that I owe unto your majesty

12672,Alls well that ends well,3,1.1.9,LAFEU,than lack it where there is such abundance.
12673,Alls well that ends well,4,1.1.10,COUNTESS,What hope is there of his majesty's amendment?

12685,Alls well that ends well,7,1.1.22,LAFEU,"How called you the man you speak of, madam?"
12686,Alls well that ends well,8,1.1.23,COUNTESS,"He was famous, sir, in his profession, and it was"

12688,Alls well that ends well,9,1.1.25,LAFEU,"He was excellent indeed, madam: the king very"
12689,Alls well that ends well,9,1.1.26,LAFEU,lately spoke of him admiringly and mourningly: he
12690,Alls well that ends well,9,1.1.27,LAFEU,"was skilful enough to have lived still, if knowledge"

12693,Alls well that ends well,11,1.1.30,LAFEU,"A fistula, my lord."
12694,Alls well that ends well,12,1.1.31,BERTRAM,I heard not of it before.
12695,Alls well that ends well,13,1.1.32,LAFEU,I would it were not notorious. Was this gentlewoman
12696,Alls well that ends well,13,1.1.33,LAFEU,the daughter of Gerard de Narbon?

12705,Alls well that ends well,15,1.1.42,LAFEU,"Your commendations, madam, get from her tears."
12706,Alls well that ends well,16,1.1.43,COUNTESS,'Tis the best brine a maiden can season her praise

12712,Alls well that ends well,17,1.1.49,HELENA,"I do affect a sorrow indeed, but I have it too."

12742,Alls well that ends well,27,1.1.77,HELENA,And these great tears grace his remembrance more
12743,Alls well that ends well,27,1.1.78,HELENA,Than those I shed for him. What was he like?
12744,Alls well that ends well,27,1.1.79,HELENA,I have forgot him: my imagination

12750,Alls well that ends well,27,1.1.85,HELENA,In his bright radiance and collateral light
12751,Alls well that ends well,27,1.1.86,HELENA,"Must I be comforted, not in his sphere."
12752,Alls well that ends well,27,1.1.87,HELENA,The ambition in my love thus plagues itself:

12764,Alls well that ends well,27,1.1.97,HELENA,"And yet I know him a notorious liar,"
12765,Alls well that ends well,27,1.1.98,HELENA,"Think him a great way fool, solely a coward,"
12766,Alls well that ends well,27,1.1.99,HELENA,"Yet these fixed evils sit so fit in him,"
12767,Alls well that ends well,27,1.1.100,HELENA,"That they take place, when virtue's steely bones"
12768,Alls well that ends well,27,1.1.101,HELENA,"Look bleak i' the cold wind: withal, full oft we see"

12772,Alls well that ends well,30,1.1.105,PAROLLES,No.
12773,Alls well that ends well,31,1.1.106,HELENA,And no.
12774,Alls well that ends well,32,1.1.107,PAROLLES,Are you meditating on virginity?
12775,Alls well that ends well,33,1.1.108,HELENA,Ay. You have some stain of soldier in you: let me
12776,Alls well that ends well,33,1.1.109,HELENA,"ask you a question. Man is enemy to virginity, how"
12777,Alls well that ends well,33,1.1.110,HELENA,may we barricado it against him?
12778,Alls well that ends well,34,1.1.111,PAROLLES,Keep him out.
12779,Alls well that ends well,35,1.1.112,HELENA,"But he assails, and our virginity, though valiant,"
12780,Alls well that ends well,35,1.1.113,HELENA,in the defence yet is weak: unfold to us some

12782,Alls well that ends well,36,1.1.115,PAROLLES,"There is none: man, sitting down before you, will"
12783,Alls well that ends well,36,1.1.116,PAROLLES,undermine you and blow you up.
12784,Alls well that ends well,37,1.1.117,HELENA,Bless our poor virginity from underminers and
12785,Alls well that ends well,37,1.1.118,HELENA,"blowers up! Is there no military policy, how"
12786,Alls well that ends well,37,1.1.119,HELENA,virgins might blow up men?
12787,Alls well that ends well,38,1.1.120,PAROLLES,"Virginity being blown down, man will quicklier be"
12788,Alls well that ends well,38,1.1.121,PAROLLES,"blown up: marry, in blowing him down again, with"
12789,Alls well that ends well,38,1.1.122,PAROLLES,"the breach yourselves made, you lose your city. It"
12790,Alls well that ends well,38,1.1.123,PAROLLES,is not politic in the commonwealth of nature to
12791,Alls well that ends well,38,1.1.124,PAROLLES,preserve virginity. Loss of virginity is rational
12792,Alls well that ends well,38,1.1.125,PAROLLES,increase and there was never virgin got till
12793,Alls well that ends well,38,1.1.126,PAROLLES,virginity was first lost. That you were made of is
12794,Alls well that ends well,38,1.1.127,PAROLLES,metal to make virgins. Virginity by being once lost
12795,Alls well that ends well,38,1.1.128,PAROLLES,"may be ten times found, by being ever kept, it is"
12796,Alls well that ends well,38,1.1.129,PAROLLES,"ever lost: 'tis too cold a companion, away with 't!"
12797,Alls well that ends well,39,1.1.130,HELENA,"I will stand for 't a little, though therefore I die a virgin."
12798,Alls well that ends well,40,1.1.131,PAROLLES,"There's little can be said in 't, 'tis against the"
12799,Alls well that ends well,40,1.1.132,PAROLLES,"rule of nature. To speak on the part of virginity,"
12800,Alls well that ends well,40,1.1.133,PAROLLES,"is to accuse your mothers, which is most infallible"
12801,Alls well that ends well,40,1.1.134,PAROLLES,disobedience. He that hangs himself is a virgin:
12802,Alls well that ends well,40,1.1.135,PAROLLES,virginity murders itself and should be buried in
12803,Alls well that ends well,40,1.1.136,PAROLLES,"highways out of all sanctified limit, as a desperate"
12804,Alls well that ends well,40,1.1.137,PAROLLES,"offendress against nature. Virginity breeds mites,"
12805,Alls well that ends well,40,1.1.138,PAROLLES,"much like a cheese, consumes itself to the very"
12806,Alls well that ends well,40,1.1.139,PAROLLES,"paring, and so dies with feeding his own stomach."
12807,Alls well that ends well,40,1.1.140,PAROLLES,"Besides, virginity is peevish, proud, idle, made of"
12808,Alls well that ends well,40,1.1.141,PAROLLES,"self-love, which is the most inhibited sin in the"
12809,Alls well that ends well,40,1.1.142,PAROLLES,"canon. Keep it not, you cannot choose but loose"
12810,Alls well that ends well,40,1.1.143,PAROLLES,by't: out with 't! within ten year it will make
12811,Alls well that ends well,40,1.1.144,PAROLLES,"itself ten, which is a goodly increase, and the"
12812,Alls well that ends well,40,1.1.145,PAROLLES,principal itself not much the worse: away with 't!
12813,Alls well that ends well,41,1.1.146,HELENA,"How might one do, sir, to lose it to her own liking?"

13692,Alls well that ends well,57,2.3.134,KING,It is a dropsied honour. Good alone
13693,Alls well that ends well,57,2.3.135,KING,Is good without a name. Vileness is so:

13695,Alls well that ends well,57,2.3.137,KING,"Not by the title. She is young, wise, fair,"

13697,Alls well that ends well,57,2.3.139,KING,"And these breed honour: that is honour's scorn,"
13698,Alls well that ends well,57,2.3.140,KING,Which challenges itself as honour's born

13715,Alls well that ends well,61,2.3.157,KING,"Proud scornful boy, unworthy this good gift,"
13716,Alls well that ends well,61,2.3.158,KING,That dost in vile misprision shackle up

14467,Alls well that ends well,21,3.6.69,PAROLLES,"By the hand of a soldier, I will undertake it."
14468,Alls well that ends well,22,3.6.70,BERTRAM,But you must not now slumber in it.
14469,Alls well that ends well,23,3.6.71,PAROLLES,I'll about it this evening: and I will presently
14470,Alls well that ends well,23,3.6.72,PAROLLES,"pen down my dilemmas, encourage myself in my"

14472,Alls well that ends well,23,3.6.74,PAROLLES,and by midnight look to hear further from me.
14473,Alls well that ends well,24,3.6.75,BERTRAM,May I be bold to acquaint his grace you are gone about it?
14474,Alls well that ends well,25,3.6.76,PAROLLES,"I know not what the success will be, my lord, but"
14475,Alls well that ends well,25,3.6.77,PAROLLES,the attempt I vow.
14476,Alls well that ends well,26,3.6.78,BERTRAM,"I know thou'rt valiant, and, to the possibility of"
14477,Alls well that ends well,26,3.6.79,BERTRAM,"thy soldiership, will subscribe for thee. Farewell."
14478,Alls well that ends well,27,3.6.80,PAROLLES,I love not many words.
14479,Alls well that ends well,27,,PAROLLES,Exit
14480,Alls well that ends well,28,3.6.81,Second Lord,No more than a fish loves water. Is not this a
14481,Alls well that ends well,28,3.6.82,Second Lord,"strange fellow, my lord, that so confidently seems"
14482,Alls well that ends well,28,3.6.83,Second Lord,"to undertake this business, which he knows is not to"
14483,Alls well that ends well,28,3.6.84,Second Lord,"be done, damns himself to do and dares better be"
14484,Alls well that ends well,28,3.6.85,Second Lord,damned than to do't?
14485,Alls well that ends well,29,3.6.86,First Lord,"You do not know him, my lord, as we do: certain it"
14486,Alls well that ends well,29,3.6.87,First Lord,is that he will steal himself into a man's favour and
14487,Alls well that ends well,29,3.6.88,First Lord,"for a week escape a great deal of discoveries, but"
14488,Alls well that ends well,29,3.6.89,First Lord,"when you find him out, you have him ever after."
14489,Alls well that ends well,30,3.6.90,BERTRAM,"Why, do you think he will make no deed at all of"
14490,Alls well that ends well,30,3.6.91,BERTRAM,this that so seriously he does address himself unto?
14491,Alls well that ends well,31,3.6.92,Second Lord,"None in the world, but return with an invention and"
14492,Alls well that ends well,31,3.6.93,Second Lord,clap upon you two or three probable lies: but we
14493,Alls well that ends well,31,3.6.94,Second Lord,"have almost embossed him, you shall see his fall"
14494,Alls well that ends well,31,3.6.95,Second Lord,"to-night, for indeed he is not for your lordship's respect."
14495,Alls well that ends well,32,3.6.96,First Lord,We'll make you some sport with the fox ere we case
14496,Alls well that ends well,32,3.6.97,First Lord,him. He was first smoked by the old lord Lafeu:
14497,Alls well that ends well,32,3.6.98,First Lord,"when his disguise and he is parted, tell me what a"

14500,Alls well that ends well,33,3.6.101,Second Lord,I must go look my twigs: he shall be caught.
14501,Alls well that ends well,34,3.6.102,BERTRAM,Your brother he shall go along with me.
14502,Alls well that ends well,35,3.6.103,Second Lord,As't please your lordship: I'll leave you.
14503,Alls well that ends well,35,,Second Lord,Exit
14504,Alls well that ends well,36,3.6.104,BERTRAM,"Now will I lead you to the house, and show you"
14505,Alls well that ends well,36,3.6.105,BERTRAM,The lass I spoke of.
14506,Alls well that ends well,37,3.6.106,First Lord,But you say she's honest.
14507,Alls well that ends well,38,3.6.107,BERTRAM,That's all the fault: I spoke with her but once
14508,Alls well that ends well,38,3.6.108,BERTRAM,"And found her wondrous cold, but I sent to her,"
14509,Alls well that ends well,38,3.6.109,BERTRAM,"By this same coxcomb that we have i' the wind,"
14510,Alls well that ends well,38,3.6.110,BERTRAM,"Tokens and letters which she did re-send,"
14511,Alls well that ends well,38,3.6.111,BERTRAM,And this is all I have done. She's a fair creature:
14512,Alls well that ends well,38,3.6.112,BERTRAM,Will you go see her?
14513,Alls well that ends well,39,3.6.113,First Lord,"With all my heart, my lord."
14514,Alls well that ends well,39,,First Lord,Exeunt

14516,Alls well that ends well,39,,First Lord,Enter HELENA and Widow
14517,Alls well that ends well,1,3.7.1,HELENA,"If you misdoubt me that I am not she,"
14518,Alls well that ends well,1,3.7.2,HELENA,"I know not how I shall assure you further,"
14519,Alls well that ends well,1,3.7.3,HELENA,But I shall lose the grounds I work upon.
14520,Alls well that ends well,2,3.7.4,Widow,"Though my estate be fallen, I was well born,"
14521,Alls well that ends well,2,3.7.5,Widow,"Nothing acquainted with these businesses,"
14522,Alls well that ends well,2,3.7.6,Widow,And would not put my reputation now
14523,Alls well that ends well,2,3.7.7,Widow,In any staining act.
14524,Alls well that ends well,3,3.7.8,HELENA,Nor would I wish you.
14525,Alls well that ends well,3,3.7.9,HELENA,"First, give me trust, the count he is my husband,"
14526,Alls well that ends well,3,3.7.10,HELENA,And what to your sworn counsel I have spoken
14527,Alls well that ends well,3,3.7.11,HELENA,"Is so from word to word, and then you cannot,"
14528,Alls well that ends well,3,3.7.12,HELENA,"By the good aid that I of you shall borrow,"
14529,Alls well that ends well,3,3.7.13,HELENA,Err in bestowing it.
14530,Alls well that ends well,4,3.7.14,Widow,I should believe you:
14531,Alls well that ends well,4,3.7.15,Widow,For you have show'd me that which well approves
14532,Alls well that ends well,4,3.7.16,Widow,You're great in fortune.
14533,Alls well that ends well,5,3.7.17,HELENA,"Take this purse of gold,"
14534,Alls well that ends well,5,3.7.18,HELENA,"And let me buy your friendly help thus far,"
14535,Alls well that ends well,5,3.7.19,HELENA,Which I will over-pay and pay again
14536,Alls well that ends well,5,3.7.20,HELENA,"When I have found it. The count he wooes your daughter,"
14537,Alls well that ends well,5,3.7.21,HELENA,"Lays down his wanton siege before her beauty,"
14538,Alls well that ends well,5,3.7.22,HELENA,"Resolved to carry her: let her in fine consent,"
14539,Alls well that ends well,5,3.7.23,HELENA,As we'll direct her how 'tis best to bear it.
14540,Alls well that ends well,5,3.7.24,HELENA,Now his important blood will nought deny
14541,Alls well that ends well,5,3.7.25,HELENA,"That she'll demand: a ring the county wears,"
14542,Alls well that ends well,5,3.7.26,HELENA,That downward hath succeeded in his house
14543,Alls well that ends well,5,3.7.27,HELENA,"From son to son, some four or five descents"
14544,Alls well that ends well,5,3.7.28,HELENA,Since the first father wore it: this ring he holds
14545,Alls well that ends well,5,3.7.29,HELENA,"In most rich choice, yet in his idle fire,"
14546,Alls well that ends well,5,3.7.30,HELENA,"To buy his will, it would not seem too dear,"
14547,Alls well that ends well,5,3.7.31,HELENA,Howe'er repented after.
14548,Alls well that ends well,6,3.7.32,Widow,Now I see
14549,Alls well that ends well,6,3.7.33,Widow,The bottom of your purpose.
14550,Alls well that ends well,7,3.7.34,HELENA,"You see it lawful, then: it is no more,"
14551,Alls well that ends well,7,3.7.35,HELENA,"But that your daughter, ere she seems as won,"
14552,Alls well that ends well,7,3.7.36,HELENA,"Desires this ring, appoints him an encounter,"
14553,Alls well that ends well,7,3.7.37,HELENA,"In fine, delivers me to fill the time,"
14554,Alls well that ends well,7,3.7.38,HELENA,"Herself most chastely absent: after this,"
14555,Alls well that ends well,7,3.7.39,HELENA,"To marry her, I'll add three thousand crowns"
14556,Alls well that ends well,7,3.7.40,HELENA,To what is passed already.
14557,Alls well that ends well,8,3.7.41,Widow,I have yielded:
14558,Alls well that ends well,8,3.7.42,Widow,"Instruct my daughter how she shall persever,"
14559,Alls well that ends well,8,3.7.43,Widow,That time and place with this deceit so lawful
14560,Alls well that ends well,8,3.7.44,Widow,May prove coherent. Every night he comes
14561,Alls well that ends well,8,3.7.45,Widow,With musics of all sorts and songs composed
14562,Alls well that ends well,8,3.7.46,Widow,To her unworthiness: it nothing steads us
14563,Alls well that ends well,8,3.7.47,Widow,"To chide him from our eaves, for he persists"
14564,Alls well that ends well,8,3.7.48,Widow,As if his life lay on't.
14565,Alls well that ends well,9,3.7.49,HELENA,Why then to-night
14566,Alls well that ends well,9,3.7.50,HELENA,"Let us assay our plot, which, if it speed,"
14567,Alls well that ends well,9,3.7.51,HELENA,Is wicked meaning in a lawful deed
14568,Alls well that ends well,9,3.7.52,HELENA,"And lawful meaning in a lawful act,"
14569,Alls well that ends well,9,3.7.53,HELENA,"Where both not sin, and yet a sinful fact:"
14570,Alls well that ends well,9,3.7.54,HELENA,But let's about it.

14574,Alls well that ends well,9,,HELENA,"Enter Second French Lord, with five or six other Soldiers in ambush"
14575,Alls well that ends well,1,4.1.1,Second Lord,He can come no other way but by this hedge-corner.
14576,Alls well that ends well,1,4.1.2,Second Lord,"When you sally upon him, speak what terrible"
14577,Alls well that ends well,1,4.1.3,Second Lord,language you will: though you understand it not
14578,Alls well that ends well,1,4.1.4,Second Lord,"yourselves, no matter, for we must not seem to"
14579,Alls well that ends well,1,4.1.5,Second Lord,"understand him, unless some one among us whom we"
14580,Alls well that ends well,1,4.1.6,Second Lord,must produce for an interpreter.
14581,Alls well that ends well,2,4.1.7,First Soldier,"Good captain, let me be the interpreter."
14582,Alls well that ends well,3,4.1.8,Second Lord,Art not acquainted with him? knows he not thy voice?
14583,Alls well that ends well,4,4.1.9,First Soldier,"No, sir, I warrant you."
14584,Alls well that ends well,5,4.1.10,Second Lord,But what linsey-woolsey hast thou to speak to us again?
14585,Alls well that ends well,6,4.1.11,First Soldier,E'en such as you speak to me.
14586,Alls well that ends well,7,4.1.12,Second Lord,He must think us some band of strangers i' the
14587,Alls well that ends well,7,4.1.13,Second Lord,adversary's entertainment. Now he hath a smack of
14588,Alls well that ends well,7,4.1.14,Second Lord,"all neighbouring languages, therefore we must every"
14589,Alls well that ends well,7,4.1.15,Second Lord,"one be a man of his own fancy, not to know what we"
14590,Alls well that ends well,7,4.1.16,Second Lord,"speak one to another, so we seem to know, is to"
14591,Alls well that ends well,7,4.1.17,Second Lord,"know straight our purpose: choughs' language,"
14592,Alls well that ends well,7,4.1.18,Second Lord,"gabble enough, and good enough. As for you,"
14593,Alls well that ends well,7,4.1.19,Second Lord,"interpreter, you must seem very politic. But couch,"
14594,Alls well that ends well,7,4.1.20,Second Lord,"ho! here he comes, to beguile two hours in a sleep,"
14595,Alls well that ends well,7,4.1.21,Second Lord,and then to return and swear the lies he forges.
14596,Alls well that ends well,7,,Second Lord,Enter PAROLLES
14597,Alls well that ends well,8,4.1.22,PAROLLES,Ten o'clock: within these three hours 'twill be
14598,Alls well that ends well,8,4.1.23,PAROLLES,time enough to go home. What shall I say I have
14599,Alls well that ends well,8,4.1.24,PAROLLES,done? It must be a very plausive invention that
14600,Alls well that ends well,8,4.1.25,PAROLLES,"carries it: they begin to smoke me, and disgraces"
14601,Alls well that ends well,8,4.1.26,PAROLLES,have of late knocked too often at my door. I find
14602,Alls well that ends well,8,4.1.27,PAROLLES,"my tongue is too foolhardy, but my heart hath the"
14603,Alls well that ends well,8,4.1.28,PAROLLES,"fear of Mars before it and of his creatures, not"
14604,Alls well that ends well,8,4.1.29,PAROLLES,daring the reports of my tongue.
14605,Alls well that ends well,9,4.1.30,Second Lord,This is the first truth that e'er thine own tongue
14606,Alls well that ends well,9,4.1.31,Second Lord,was guilty of.
14607,Alls well that ends well,10,4.1.32,PAROLLES,What the devil should move me to undertake the
14608,Alls well that ends well,10,4.1.33,PAROLLES,"recovery of this drum, being not ignorant of the"
14609,Alls well that ends well,10,4.1.34,PAROLLES,"impossibility, and knowing I had no such purpose? I"
14610,Alls well that ends well,10,4.1.35,PAROLLES,"must give myself some hurts, and say I got them in"
14611,Alls well that ends well,10,4.1.36,PAROLLES,"exploit: yet slight ones will not carry it, they"
14612,Alls well that ends well,10,4.1.37,PAROLLES,"will say, 'Came you off with so little?' and great"
14613,Alls well that ends well,10,4.1.38,PAROLLES,"ones I dare not give. Wherefore, what's the"
14614,Alls well that ends well,10,4.1.39,PAROLLES,"instance? Tongue, I must put you into a"
14615,Alls well that ends well,10,4.1.40,PAROLLES,butter-woman's mouth and buy myself another of
14616,Alls well that ends well,10,4.1.41,PAROLLES,"Bajazet's mule, if you prattle me into these perils."
14617,Alls well that ends well,11,4.1.42,Second Lord,"Is it possible he should know what he is, and be"
14618,Alls well that ends well,11,4.1.43,Second Lord,that he is?
14619,Alls well that ends well,12,4.1.44,PAROLLES,I would the cutting of my garments would serve the

14621,Alls well that ends well,13,4.1.46,Second Lord,We cannot afford you so.
14622,Alls well that ends well,14,4.1.47,PAROLLES,"Or the baring of my beard, and to say it was in"

14624,Alls well that ends well,15,4.1.49,Second Lord,'Twould not do.

14628,Alls well that ends well,19,4.1.53,Second Lord,How deep?
14629,Alls well that ends well,20,4.1.54,PAROLLES,Thirty fathom.
14630,Alls well that ends well,21,4.1.55,Second Lord,Three great oaths would scarce make that be believed.
14631,Alls well that ends well,22,4.1.56,PAROLLES,I would I had any drum of the enemy's: I would swear
14632,Alls well that ends well,22,4.1.57,PAROLLES,I recovered it.
14633,Alls well that ends well,23,4.1.58,Second Lord,You shall hear one anon.

14641,Alls well that ends well,29,4.1.64,PAROLLES,I know you are the Muskos' regiment:

14676,Alls well that ends well,1,4.2.1,BERTRAM,They told me that your name was Fontibell.
14677,Alls well that ends well,2,4.2.2,DIANA,"No, my good lord, Diana."
14678,Alls well that ends well,3,4.2.3,BERTRAM,"Titled goddess,"
14679,Alls well that ends well,3,4.2.4,BERTRAM,"And worth it, with addition! But, fair soul,"
14680,Alls well that ends well,3,4.2.5,BERTRAM,In your fine frame hath love no quality?
14681,Alls well that ends well,3,4.2.6,BERTRAM,"If quick fire of youth light not your mind,"
14682,Alls well that ends well,3,4.2.7,BERTRAM,"You are no maiden, but a monument:"
14683,Alls well that ends well,3,4.2.8,BERTRAM,"When you are dead, you should be such a one"
14684,Alls well that ends well,3,4.2.9,BERTRAM,"As you are now, for you are cold and stem,"
14685,Alls well that ends well,3,4.2.10,BERTRAM,And now you should be as your mother was
14686,Alls well that ends well,3,4.2.11,BERTRAM,When your sweet self was got.
14687,Alls well that ends well,4,4.2.12,DIANA,She then was honest.
14688,Alls well that ends well,5,4.2.13,BERTRAM,So should you be.
14689,Alls well that ends well,6,4.2.14,DIANA,No:
14690,Alls well that ends well,6,4.2.15,DIANA,"My mother did but duty, such, my lord,"
14691,Alls well that ends well,6,4.2.16,DIANA,As you owe to your wife.
14692,Alls well that ends well,7,4.2.17,BERTRAM,"No more o' that,"
14693,Alls well that ends well,7,4.2.18,BERTRAM,"I prithee, do not strive against my vows:"
14694,Alls well that ends well,7,4.2.19,BERTRAM,"I was compell'd to her, but I love thee"
14695,Alls well that ends well,7,4.2.20,BERTRAM,"By love's own sweet constraint, and will for ever"
14696,Alls well that ends well,7,4.2.21,BERTRAM,Do thee all rights of service.
14697,Alls well that ends well,8,4.2.22,DIANA,"Ay, so you serve us"
14698,Alls well that ends well,8,4.2.23,DIANA,"Till we serve you, but when you have our roses,"
14699,Alls well that ends well,8,4.2.24,DIANA,You barely leave our thorns to prick ourselves
14700,Alls well that ends well,8,4.2.25,DIANA,And mock us with our bareness.
14701,Alls well that ends well,9,4.2.26,BERTRAM,How have I sworn!
14702,Alls well that ends well,10,4.2.27,DIANA,"'Tis not the many oaths that makes the truth,"
14703,Alls well that ends well,10,4.2.28,DIANA,But the plain single vow that is vow'd true.
14704,Alls well that ends well,10,4.2.29,DIANA,"What is not holy, that we swear not by,"
14705,Alls well that ends well,10,4.2.30,DIANA,"But take the High'st to witness: then, pray you, tell me,"
14706,Alls well that ends well,10,4.2.31,DIANA,"If I should swear by God's great attributes,"
14707,Alls well that ends well,10,4.2.32,DIANA,"I loved you dearly, would you believe my oaths,"
14708,Alls well that ends well,10,4.2.33,DIANA,"When I did love you ill? This has no holding,"
14709,Alls well that ends well,10,4.2.34,DIANA,"To swear by him whom I protest to love,"
14710,Alls well that ends well,10,4.2.35,DIANA,That I will work against him: therefore your oaths
14711,Alls well that ends well,10,4.2.36,DIANA,"Are words and poor conditions, but unseal'd,"
14712,Alls well that ends well,10,4.2.37,DIANA,At least in my opinion.
14713,Alls well that ends well,11,4.2.38,BERTRAM,"Change it, change it,"
14714,Alls well that ends well,11,4.2.39,BERTRAM,"Be not so holy-cruel: love is holy,"
14715,Alls well that ends well,11,4.2.40,BERTRAM,And my integrity ne'er knew the crafts
14716,Alls well that ends well,11,4.2.41,BERTRAM,"That you do charge men with. Stand no more off,"
14717,Alls well that ends well,11,4.2.42,BERTRAM,"But give thyself unto my sick desires,"
14718,Alls well that ends well,11,4.2.43,BERTRAM,"Who then recover: say thou art mine, and ever"
14719,Alls well that ends well,11,4.2.44,BERTRAM,My love as it begins shall so persever.
14720,Alls well that ends well,12,4.2.45,DIANA,I see that men make ropes in such a scarre
14721,Alls well that ends well,12,4.2.46,DIANA,That we'll forsake ourselves. Give me that ring.
14722,Alls well that ends well,13,4.2.47,BERTRAM,"I'll lend it thee, my dear, but have no power"
14723,Alls well that ends well,13,4.2.48,BERTRAM,To give it from me.
14724,Alls well that ends well,14,4.2.49,DIANA,"Will you not, my lord?"
14725,Alls well that ends well,15,4.2.50,BERTRAM,"It is an honour 'longing to our house,"
14726,Alls well that ends well,15,4.2.51,BERTRAM,"Bequeathed down from many ancestors,"
14727,Alls well that ends well,15,4.2.52,BERTRAM,Which were the greatest obloquy i' the world
14728,Alls well that ends well,15,4.2.53,BERTRAM,In me to lose.
14729,Alls well that ends well,16,4.2.54,DIANA,Mine honour's such a ring:
14730,Alls well that ends well,16,4.2.55,DIANA,"My chastity's the jewel of our house,"
14731,Alls well that ends well,16,4.2.56,DIANA,"Bequeathed down from many ancestors,"
14732,Alls well that ends well,16,4.2.57,DIANA,Which were the greatest obloquy i' the world
14733,Alls well that ends well,16,4.2.58,DIANA,In me to lose: thus your own proper wisdom
14734,Alls well that ends well,16,4.2.59,DIANA,"Brings in the champion Honour on my part,"
14735,Alls well that ends well,16,4.2.60,DIANA,Against your vain assault.
14736,Alls well that ends well,17,4.2.61,BERTRAM,"Here, take my ring:"
14737,Alls well that ends well,17,4.2.62,BERTRAM,"My house, mine honour, yea, my life, be thine,"
14738,Alls well that ends well,17,4.2.63,BERTRAM,And I'll be bid by thee.
14739,Alls well that ends well,18,4.2.64,DIANA,"When midnight comes, knock at my chamber-window:"
14740,Alls well that ends well,18,4.2.65,DIANA,I'll order take my mother shall not hear.
14741,Alls well that ends well,18,4.2.66,DIANA,"Now will I charge you in the band of truth,"
14742,Alls well that ends well,18,4.2.67,DIANA,"When you have conquer'd my yet maiden bed,"
14743,Alls well that ends well,18,4.2.68,DIANA,"Remain there but an hour, nor speak to me:"
14744,Alls well that ends well,18,4.2.69,DIANA,"My reasons are most strong, and you shall know them"
14745,Alls well that ends well,18,4.2.70,DIANA,When back again this ring shall be deliver'd:
14746,Alls well that ends well,18,4.2.71,DIANA,And on your finger in the night I'll put
14747,Alls well that ends well,18,4.2.72,DIANA,"Another ring, that what in time proceeds"
14748,Alls well that ends well,18,4.2.73,DIANA,May token to the future our past deeds.
14749,Alls well that ends well,18,4.2.74,DIANA,"Adieu, till then, then, fail not. You have won"
14750,Alls well that ends well,18,4.2.75,DIANA,"A wife of me, though there my hope be done."
14751,Alls well that ends well,19,4.2.76,BERTRAM,A heaven on earth I have won by wooing thee.
14752,Alls well that ends well,19,,BERTRAM,Exit
14753,Alls well that ends well,20,4.2.77,DIANA,For which live long to thank both heaven and me!
14754,Alls well that ends well,20,4.2.78,DIANA,You may so in the end.
14755,Alls well that ends well,20,4.2.79,DIANA,"My mother told me just how he would woo,"
14756,Alls well that ends well,20,4.2.80,DIANA,"As if she sat in 's heart, she says all men"
14757,Alls well that ends well,20,4.2.81,DIANA,Have the like oaths: he had sworn to marry me
14758,Alls well that ends well,20,4.2.82,DIANA,"When his wife's dead, therefore I'll lie with him"
14759,Alls well that ends well,20,4.2.83,DIANA,"When I am buried. Since Frenchmen are so braid,"
14760,Alls well that ends well,20,4.2.84,DIANA,"Marry that will, I live and die a maid:"
14761,Alls well that ends well,20,4.2.85,DIANA,Only in this disguise I think't no sin
14762,Alls well that ends well,20,4.2.86,DIANA,To cozen him that would unjustly win.
14763,Alls well that ends well,20,,DIANA,Exit
14764,Alls well that ends well,20,,DIANA,SCENE III. The Florentine camp.
14765,Alls well that ends well,20,,DIANA,Enter the two French Lords and some two or three Soldiers
14766,Alls well that ends well,1,4.3.1,First Lord,You have not given him his mother's letter?
14767,Alls well that ends well,2,4.3.2,Second Lord,I have delivered it an hour since: there is
14768,Alls well that ends well,2,4.3.3,Second Lord,"something in't that stings his nature, for on the"
14769,Alls well that ends well,2,4.3.4,Second Lord,reading it he changed almost into another man.
14770,Alls well that ends well,3,4.3.5,First Lord,He has much worthy blame laid upon him for shaking
14771,Alls well that ends well,3,4.3.6,First Lord,off so good a wife and so sweet a lady.
14772,Alls well that ends well,4,4.3.7,Second Lord,Especially he hath incurred the everlasting
14773,Alls well that ends well,4,4.3.8,Second Lord,"displeasure of the king, who had even tuned his"
14774,Alls well that ends well,4,4.3.9,Second Lord,bounty to sing happiness to him. I will tell you a
14775,Alls well that ends well,4,4.3.10,Second Lord,"thing, but you shall let it dwell darkly with you."
14776,Alls well that ends well,5,4.3.11,First Lord,"When you have spoken it, 'tis dead, and I am the"
14777,Alls well that ends well,5,4.3.12,First Lord,grave of it.
14778,Alls well that ends well,6,4.3.13,Second Lord,He hath perverted a young gentlewoman here in
14779,Alls well that ends well,6,4.3.14,Second Lord,"Florence, of a most chaste renown, and this night he"
14780,Alls well that ends well,6,4.3.15,Second Lord,fleshes his will in the spoil of her honour: he hath
14781,Alls well that ends well,6,4.3.16,Second Lord,"given her his monumental ring, and thinks himself"
14782,Alls well that ends well,6,4.3.17,Second Lord,made in the unchaste composition.
14783,Alls well that ends well,7,4.3.18,First Lord,"Now, God delay our rebellion! as we are ourselves,"
14784,Alls well that ends well,7,4.3.19,First Lord,what things are we!
14785,Alls well that ends well,8,4.3.20,Second Lord,Merely our own traitors. And as in the common course
14786,Alls well that ends well,8,4.3.21,Second Lord,"of all treasons, we still see them reveal"
14787,Alls well that ends well,8,4.3.22,Second Lord,"themselves, till they attain to their abhorred ends,"
14788,Alls well that ends well,8,4.3.23,Second Lord,so he that in this action contrives against his own
14789,Alls well that ends well,8,4.3.24,Second Lord,"nobility, in his proper stream o'erflows himself."
14790,Alls well that ends well,9,4.3.25,First Lord,"Is it not meant damnable in us, to be trumpeters of"
14791,Alls well that ends well,9,4.3.26,First Lord,our unlawful intents? We shall not then have his
14792,Alls well that ends well,9,4.3.27,First Lord,company to-night?
14793,Alls well that ends well,10,4.3.28,Second Lord,"Not till after midnight, for he is dieted to his hour."
14794,Alls well that ends well,11,4.3.29,First Lord,"That approaches apace, I would gladly have him see"
14795,Alls well that ends well,11,4.3.30,First Lord,"his company anatomized, that he might take a measure"
14796,Alls well that ends well,11,4.3.31,First Lord,"of his own judgments, wherein so curiously he had"
14797,Alls well that ends well,11,4.3.32,First Lord,set this counterfeit.
14798,Alls well that ends well,12,4.3.33,Second Lord,"We will not meddle with him till he come, for his"
14799,Alls well that ends well,12,4.3.34,Second Lord,presence must be the whip of the other.
14800,Alls well that ends well,13,4.3.35,First Lord,"In the mean time, what hear you of these wars?"
14801,Alls well that ends well,14,4.3.36,Second Lord,I hear there is an overture of peace.
14802,Alls well that ends well,15,4.3.37,First Lord,"Nay, I assure you, a peace concluded."
14803,Alls well that ends well,16,4.3.38,Second Lord,What will Count Rousillon do then? will he travel
14804,Alls well that ends well,16,4.3.39,Second Lord,"higher, or return again into France?"
14805,Alls well that ends well,17,4.3.40,First Lord,"I perceive, by this demand, you are not altogether"
14806,Alls well that ends well,17,4.3.41,First Lord,of his council.
14807,Alls well that ends well,18,4.3.42,Second Lord,"Let it be forbid, sir, so should I be a great deal"
14808,Alls well that ends well,18,4.3.43,Second Lord,of his act.
14809,Alls well that ends well,19,4.3.44,First Lord,"Sir, his wife some two months since fled from his"
14810,Alls well that ends well,19,4.3.45,First Lord,house: her pretence is a pilgrimage to Saint Jaques
14811,Alls well that ends well,19,4.3.46,First Lord,"le Grand, which holy undertaking with most austere"
14812,Alls well that ends well,19,4.3.47,First Lord,"sanctimony she accomplished, and, there residing the"
14813,Alls well that ends well,19,4.3.48,First Lord,tenderness of her nature became as a prey to her
14814,Alls well that ends well,19,4.3.49,First Lord,"grief, in fine, made a groan of her last breath, and"
14815,Alls well that ends well,19,4.3.50,First Lord,now she sings in heaven.
14816,Alls well that ends well,20,4.3.51,Second Lord,How is this justified?
14817,Alls well that ends well,21,4.3.52,First Lord,"The stronger part of it by her own letters, which"
14818,Alls well that ends well,21,4.3.53,First Lord,"makes her story true, even to the point of her"
14819,Alls well that ends well,21,4.3.54,First Lord,"death: her death itself, which could not be her"
14820,Alls well that ends well,21,4.3.55,First Lord,"office to say is come, was faithfully confirmed by"
14821,Alls well that ends well,21,4.3.56,First Lord,the rector of the place.
14822,Alls well that ends well,22,4.3.57,Second Lord,Hath the count all this intelligence?
14823,Alls well that ends well,23,4.3.58,First Lord,"Ay, and the particular confirmations, point from"
14824,Alls well that ends well,23,4.3.59,First Lord,"point, so to the full arming of the verity."
14825,Alls well that ends well,24,4.3.60,Second Lord,I am heartily sorry that he'll be glad of this.
14826,Alls well that ends well,25,4.3.61,First Lord,How mightily sometimes we make us comforts of our losses!
14827,Alls well that ends well,26,4.3.62,Second Lord,And how mightily some other times we drown our gain
14828,Alls well that ends well,26,4.3.63,Second Lord,in tears! The great dignity that his valour hath
14829,Alls well that ends well,26,4.3.64,Second Lord,here acquired for him shall at home be encountered
14830,Alls well that ends well,26,4.3.65,Second Lord,with a shame as ample.
14831,Alls well that ends well,27,4.3.66,First Lord,"The web of our life is of a mingled yarn, good and"
14832,Alls well that ends well,27,4.3.67,First Lord,"ill together: our virtues would be proud, if our"
14833,Alls well that ends well,27,4.3.68,First Lord,"faults whipped them not, and our crimes would"
14834,Alls well that ends well,27,4.3.69,First Lord,"despair, if they were not cherished by our virtues."
14835,Alls well that ends well,27,,First Lord,Enter a Messenger
14836,Alls well that ends well,27,4.3.70,First Lord,How now! where's your master?
14837,Alls well that ends well,28,4.3.71,Servant,"He met the duke in the street, sir, of whom he hath"
14838,Alls well that ends well,28,4.3.72,Servant,taken a solemn leave: his lordship will next

14840,Alls well that ends well,28,4.3.74,Servant,letters of commendations to the king.
14841,Alls well that ends well,29,4.3.75,Second Lord,"They shall be no more than needful there, if they"

14843,Alls well that ends well,30,4.3.77,First Lord,They cannot be too sweet for the king's tartness.
14844,Alls well that ends well,30,4.3.78,First Lord,Here's his lordship now.
14845,Alls well that ends well,30,,First Lord,Enter BERTRAM
14846,Alls well that ends well,30,4.3.79,First Lord,"How now, my lord! is't not after midnight?"
14847,Alls well that ends well,31,4.3.80,BERTRAM,"I have to-night dispatched sixteen businesses, a"

14852,Alls well that ends well,31,4.3.85,BERTRAM,and between these main parcels of dispatch effected

14863,Alls well that ends well,34,4.3.96,Second Lord,"Bring him forth: has sat i' the stocks all night,"
14864,Alls well that ends well,34,4.3.97,Second Lord,poor gallant knave.
14865,Alls well that ends well,35,4.3.98,BERTRAM,"No matter: his heels have deserved it, in usurping"

15692,Alls well that ends well,105,5.3.332,DIANA,"And he shall surety me. But for this lord,"
15693,Alls well that ends well,105,5.3.333,DIANA,"Who hath abused me, as he knows himself,"
15694,Alls well that ends well,105,5.3.334,DIANA,"Though yet he never harm'd me, here I quit him:"
15695,Alls well that ends well,105,5.3.335,DIANA,"He knows himself my bed he hath defiled,"
15696,Alls well that ends well,105,5.3.336,DIANA,And at that time he got his wife with child:
15697,Alls well that ends well,105,5.3.337,DIANA,"Dead though she be, she feels her young one kick:"
15698,Alls well that ends well,105,5.3.338,DIANA,So there's my riddle: one that's dead is quick:
15699,Alls well that ends well,105,5.3.339,DIANA,And now behold the meaning.
15700,Alls well that ends well,105,,DIANA,"Re-enter Widow, with HELENA"

15705,Alls well that ends well,107,5.3.344,HELENA,"'Tis but the shadow of a wife you see,"
15706,Alls well that ends well,107,5.3.345,HELENA,The name and not the thing.
15707,Alls well that ends well,108,5.3.346,BERTRAM,"Both, both. O, pardon!"
15708,Alls well that ends well,109,5.3.347,HELENA,"O my good lord, when I was like this maid,"
15709,Alls well that ends well,109,5.3.348,HELENA,"I found you wondrous kind. There is your ring,"
15710,Alls well that ends well,109,5.3.349,HELENA,"And, look you, here's your letter, this it says:"

15731,Alls well that ends well,113,5.3.368,KING,"Of that and all the progress, more or less,"
15732,Alls well that ends well,113,5.3.369,KING,Resolvedly more leisure shall express:

15745,As you like it,114,,KING,SCENE I. Orchard of Oliver's house.
15746,As you like it,114,,KING,Enter ORLANDO and ADAM
15747,As you like it,1,1.1.1,ORLANDO,"As I remember, Adam, it was upon this fashion"
15748,As you like it,1,1.1.2,ORLANDO,"bequeathed me by will but poor a thousand crowns,"
15749,As you like it,1,1.1.3,ORLANDO,"and, as thou sayest, charged my brother, on his"
15750,As you like it,1,1.1.4,ORLANDO,"blessing, to breed me well: and there begins my"
15751,As you like it,1,1.1.5,ORLANDO,"sadness. My brother Jaques he keeps at school, and"
15752,As you like it,1,1.1.6,ORLANDO,"report speaks goldenly of his profit: for my part,"
15753,As you like it,1,1.1.7,ORLANDO,"he keeps me rustically at home, or, to speak more"
15754,As you like it,1,1.1.8,ORLANDO,"properly, stays me here at home unkept, for call you"
15755,As you like it,1,1.1.9,ORLANDO,"that keeping for a gentleman of my birth, that"
15756,As you like it,1,1.1.10,ORLANDO,differs not from the stalling of an ox? His horses
15757,As you like it,1,1.1.11,ORLANDO,"are bred better, for, besides that they are fair"
15758,As you like it,1,1.1.12,ORLANDO,"with their feeding, they are taught their manage,"
15759,As you like it,1,1.1.13,ORLANDO,"and to that end riders dearly hired: but I, his"
15760,As you like it,1,1.1.14,ORLANDO,"brother, gain nothing under him but growth, for the"
15761,As you like it,1,1.1.15,ORLANDO,which his animals on his dunghills are as much
15762,As you like it,1,1.1.16,ORLANDO,bound to him as I. Besides this nothing that he so
15763,As you like it,1,1.1.17,ORLANDO,"plentifully gives me, the something that nature gave"
15764,As you like it,1,1.1.18,ORLANDO,me his countenance seems to take from me: he lets
15765,As you like it,1,1.1.19,ORLANDO,"me feed with his hinds, bars me the place of a"
15766,As you like it,1,1.1.20,ORLANDO,"brother, and, as much as in him lies, mines my"
15767,As you like it,1,1.1.21,ORLANDO,"gentility with my education. This is it, Adam, that"
15768,As you like it,1,1.1.22,ORLANDO,"grieves me, and the spirit of my father, which I"
15769,As you like it,1,1.1.23,ORLANDO,"think is within me, begins to mutiny against this"
15770,As you like it,1,1.1.24,ORLANDO,"servitude: I will no longer endure it, though yet I"
15771,As you like it,1,1.1.25,ORLANDO,know no wise remedy how to avoid it.
15772,As you like it,2,1.1.26,ADAM,"Yonder comes my master, your brother."
15773,As you like it,3,1.1.27,ORLANDO,"Go apart, Adam, and thou shalt hear how he will"
15774,As you like it,3,1.1.28,ORLANDO,shake me up.
15775,As you like it,3,,ORLANDO,Enter OLIVER
15776,As you like it,4,1.1.29,OLIVER,"Now, sir! what make you here?"
15777,As you like it,5,1.1.30,ORLANDO,Nothing: I am not taught to make any thing.
15778,As you like it,6,1.1.31,OLIVER,"What mar you then, sir?"
15779,As you like it,7,1.1.32,ORLANDO,"Marry, sir, I am helping you to mar that which God"
15780,As you like it,7,1.1.33,ORLANDO,"made, a poor unworthy brother of yours, with idleness."
15781,As you like it,8,1.1.34,OLIVER,"Marry, sir, be better employed, and be naught awhile."
15782,As you like it,9,1.1.35,ORLANDO,Shall I keep your hogs and eat husks with them?
15783,As you like it,9,1.1.36,ORLANDO,"What prodigal portion have I spent, that I should"
15784,As you like it,9,1.1.37,ORLANDO,come to such penury?
15785,As you like it,10,1.1.38,OLIVER,"Know you where your are, sir?"
15786,As you like it,11,1.1.39,ORLANDO,"O, sir, very well, here in your orchard."
15787,As you like it,12,1.1.40,OLIVER,"Know you before whom, sir?"
15788,As you like it,13,1.1.41,ORLANDO,"Ay, better than him I am before knows me. I know"
15789,As you like it,13,1.1.42,ORLANDO,"you are my eldest brother, and, in the gentle"
15790,As you like it,13,1.1.43,ORLANDO,"condition of blood, you should so know me. The"
15791,As you like it,13,1.1.44,ORLANDO,"courtesy of nations allows you my better, in that"
15792,As you like it,13,1.1.45,ORLANDO,"you are the first-born, but the same tradition"
15793,As you like it,13,1.1.46,ORLANDO,"takes not away my blood, were there twenty brothers"
15794,As you like it,13,1.1.47,ORLANDO,betwixt us: I have as much of my father in me as
15795,As you like it,13,1.1.48,ORLANDO,"you, albeit, I confess, your coming before me is"
15796,As you like it,13,1.1.49,ORLANDO,nearer to his reverence.
15797,As you like it,14,1.1.50,OLIVER,"What, boy!"
15798,As you like it,15,1.1.51,ORLANDO,"Come, come, elder brother, you are too young in this."
15799,As you like it,16,1.1.52,OLIVER,"Wilt thou lay hands on me, villain?"
15800,As you like it,17,1.1.53,ORLANDO,"I am no villain, I am the youngest son of Sir"
15801,As you like it,17,1.1.54,ORLANDO,"Rowland de Boys, he was my father, and he is thrice"
15802,As you like it,17,1.1.55,ORLANDO,a villain that says such a father begot villains.
15803,As you like it,17,1.1.56,ORLANDO,"Wert thou not my brother, I would not take this hand"
15804,As you like it,17,1.1.57,ORLANDO,from thy throat till this other had pulled out thy
15805,As you like it,17,1.1.58,ORLANDO,tongue for saying so: thou hast railed on thyself.
15806,As you like it,18,1.1.59,ADAM,"Sweet masters, be patient: for your father's"
15807,As you like it,18,1.1.60,ADAM,"remembrance, be at accord."
15808,As you like it,19,1.1.61,OLIVER,"Let me go, I say."
15809,As you like it,20,1.1.62,ORLANDO,"I will not, till I please: you shall hear me. My"
15810,As you like it,20,1.1.63,ORLANDO,father charged you in his will to give me good
15811,As you like it,20,1.1.64,ORLANDO,"education: you have trained me like a peasant,"
15812,As you like it,20,1.1.65,ORLANDO,obscuring and hiding from me all gentleman-like
15813,As you like it,20,1.1.66,ORLANDO,qualities. The spirit of my father grows strong in
15814,As you like it,20,1.1.67,ORLANDO,"me, and I will no longer endure it: therefore allow"
15815,As you like it,20,1.1.68,ORLANDO,"me such exercises as may become a gentleman, or"
15816,As you like it,20,1.1.69,ORLANDO,give me the poor allottery my father left me by
15817,As you like it,20,1.1.70,ORLANDO,"testament, with that I will go buy my fortunes."
15818,As you like it,21,1.1.71,OLIVER,"And what wilt thou do? beg, when that is spent?"
15819,As you like it,21,1.1.72,OLIVER,"Well, sir, get you in: I will not long be troubled"
15820,As you like it,21,1.1.73,OLIVER,"with you, you shall have some part of your will: I"
15821,As you like it,21,1.1.74,OLIVER,"pray you, leave me."
15822,As you like it,22,1.1.75,ORLANDO,I will no further offend you than becomes me for my good.
15823,As you like it,23,1.1.76,OLIVER,"Get you with him, you old dog."
15824,As you like it,24,1.1.77,ADAM,"Is 'old dog' my reward? Most true, I have lost my"
15825,As you like it,24,1.1.78,ADAM,teeth in your service. God be with my old master!
15826,As you like it,24,1.1.79,ADAM,he would not have spoke such a word.
15827,As you like it,24,,ADAM,Exeunt ORLANDO and ADAM
15828,As you like it,25,1.1.80,OLIVER,Is it even so? begin you to grow upon me? I will
15829,As you like it,25,1.1.81,OLIVER,"physic your rankness, and yet give no thousand"
15830,As you like it,25,1.1.82,OLIVER,"crowns neither. Holla, Dennis!"
15831,As you like it,25,,OLIVER,Enter DENNIS

15833,As you like it,27,1.1.84,OLIVER,"Was not Charles, the duke's wrestler, here to speak with me?"
15834,As you like it,28,1.1.85,DENNIS,"So please you, he is here at the door and importunes"

15836,As you like it,29,1.1.87,OLIVER,Call him in.
15837,As you like it,29,,OLIVER,Exit DENNIS
15838,As you like it,29,1.1.88,OLIVER,"'Twill be a good way, and to-morrow the wrestling is."
15839,As you like it,29,,OLIVER,Enter CHARLES
15840,As you like it,30,1.1.89,CHARLES,Good morrow to your worship.
15841,As you like it,31,1.1.90,OLIVER,"Good Monsieur Charles, what's the new news at the"
15842,As you like it,31,1.1.91,OLIVER,new court?
15843,As you like it,32,1.1.92,CHARLES,"There's no news at the court, sir, but the old news:"
15844,As you like it,32,1.1.93,CHARLES,"that is, the old duke is banished by his younger"
15845,As you like it,32,1.1.94,CHARLES,"brother the new duke, and three or four loving lords"
15846,As you like it,32,1.1.95,CHARLES,"have put themselves into voluntary exile with him,"
15847,As you like it,32,1.1.96,CHARLES,"whose lands and revenues enrich the new duke,"
15848,As you like it,32,1.1.97,CHARLES,therefore he gives them good leave to wander.
15849,As you like it,33,1.1.98,OLIVER,"Can you tell if Rosalind, the duke's daughter, be"
15850,As you like it,33,1.1.99,OLIVER,banished with her father?
15851,As you like it,34,1.1.100,CHARLES,"O, no, for the duke's daughter, her cousin, so loves"
15852,As you like it,34,1.1.101,CHARLES,"her, being ever from their cradles bred together,"
15853,As you like it,34,1.1.102,CHARLES,"that she would have followed her exile, or have died"
15854,As you like it,34,1.1.103,CHARLES,"to stay behind her. She is at the court, and no"
15855,As you like it,34,1.1.104,CHARLES,"less beloved of her uncle than his own daughter, and"
15856,As you like it,34,1.1.105,CHARLES,never two ladies loved as they do.
15857,As you like it,35,1.1.106,OLIVER,Where will the old duke live?
15858,As you like it,36,1.1.107,CHARLES,"They say he is already in the forest of Arden, and"
15859,As you like it,36,1.1.108,CHARLES,"a many merry men with him, and there they live like"
15860,As you like it,36,1.1.109,CHARLES,the old Robin Hood of England: they say many young
15861,As you like it,36,1.1.110,CHARLES,"gentlemen flock to him every day, and fleet the time"
15862,As you like it,36,1.1.111,CHARLES,"carelessly, as they did in the golden world."
15863,As you like it,37,1.1.112,OLIVER,"What, you wrestle to-morrow before the new duke?"
15864,As you like it,38,1.1.113,CHARLES,"Marry, do I, sir, and I came to acquaint you with a"

15866,As you like it,38,1.1.115,CHARLES,that your younger brother Orlando hath a disposition
15867,As you like it,38,1.1.116,CHARLES,to come in disguised against me to try a fall.
15868,As you like it,38,1.1.117,CHARLES,"To-morrow, sir, I wrestle for my credit, and he that"
15869,As you like it,38,1.1.118,CHARLES,escapes me without some broken limb shall acquit him
15870,As you like it,38,1.1.119,CHARLES,"well. Your brother is but young and tender, and,"
15871,As you like it,38,1.1.120,CHARLES,"for your love, I would be loath to foil him, as I"
15872,As you like it,38,1.1.121,CHARLES,"must, for my own honour, if he come in: therefore,"
15873,As you like it,38,1.1.122,CHARLES,"out of my love to you, I came hither to acquaint you"
15874,As you like it,38,1.1.123,CHARLES,"withal, that either you might stay him from his"
15875,As you like it,38,1.1.124,CHARLES,intendment or brook such disgrace well as he shall
15876,As you like it,38,1.1.125,CHARLES,"run into, in that it is a thing of his own search"
15877,As you like it,38,1.1.126,CHARLES,and altogether against my will.
15878,As you like it,39,1.1.127,OLIVER,"Charles, I thank thee for thy love to me, which"
15879,As you like it,39,1.1.128,OLIVER,thou shalt find I will most kindly requite. I had
15880,As you like it,39,1.1.129,OLIVER,myself notice of my brother's purpose herein and
15881,As you like it,39,1.1.130,OLIVER,have by underhand means laboured to dissuade him from
15882,As you like it,39,1.1.131,OLIVER,"it, but he is resolute. I'll tell thee, Charles:"
15883,As you like it,39,1.1.132,OLIVER,"it is the stubbornest young fellow of France, full"
15884,As you like it,39,1.1.133,OLIVER,"of ambition, an envious emulator of every man's"
15885,As you like it,39,1.1.134,OLIVER,"good parts, a secret and villanous contriver against"
15886,As you like it,39,1.1.135,OLIVER,me his natural brother: therefore use thy
15887,As you like it,39,1.1.136,OLIVER,"discretion, I had as lief thou didst break his neck"
15888,As you like it,39,1.1.137,OLIVER,"as his finger. And thou wert best look to't, for if"
15889,As you like it,39,1.1.138,OLIVER,thou dost him any slight disgrace or if he do not
15890,As you like it,39,1.1.139,OLIVER,"mightily grace himself on thee, he will practise"
15891,As you like it,39,1.1.140,OLIVER,"against thee by poison, entrap thee by some"
15892,As you like it,39,1.1.141,OLIVER,treacherous device and never leave thee till he

15894,As you like it,39,1.1.143,OLIVER,"for, I assure thee, and almost with tears I speak"
15895,As you like it,39,1.1.144,OLIVER,"it, there is not one so young and so villanous this"
15896,As you like it,39,1.1.145,OLIVER,"day living. I speak but brotherly of him, but"
15897,As you like it,39,1.1.146,OLIVER,"should I anatomize him to thee as he is, I must"
15898,As you like it,39,1.1.147,OLIVER,blush and weep and thou must look pale and wonder.
15899,As you like it,40,1.1.148,CHARLES,I am heartily glad I came hither to you. If he come
15900,As you like it,40,1.1.149,CHARLES,"to-morrow, I'll give him his payment: if ever he go"
15901,As you like it,40,1.1.150,CHARLES,"alone again, I'll never wrestle for prize more: and"
15902,As you like it,40,1.1.151,CHARLES,so God keep your worship!
15903,As you like it,41,1.1.152,OLIVER,"Farewell, good Charles."
15904,As you like it,41,,OLIVER,Exit CHARLES
15905,As you like it,41,1.1.153,OLIVER,Now will I stir this gamester: I hope I shall see
15906,As you like it,41,1.1.154,OLIVER,"an end of him, for my soul, yet I know not why,"
15907,As you like it,41,1.1.155,OLIVER,"hates nothing more than he. Yet he's gentle, never"
15908,As you like it,41,1.1.156,OLIVER,"schooled and yet learned, full of noble device, of"
15909,As you like it,41,1.1.157,OLIVER,"all sorts enchantingly beloved, and indeed so much"
15910,As you like it,41,1.1.158,OLIVER,"in the heart of the world, and especially of my own"
15911,As you like it,41,1.1.159,OLIVER,"people, who best know him, that I am altogether"
15912,As you like it,41,1.1.160,OLIVER,"misprised: but it shall not be so long, this"
15913,As you like it,41,1.1.161,OLIVER,wrestler shall clear all: nothing remains but that
15914,As you like it,41,1.1.162,OLIVER,"I kindle the boy thither, which now I'll go about."
15915,As you like it,41,,OLIVER,Exit
15916,As you like it,41,,OLIVER,SCENE II. Lawn before the Duke's palace.
15917,As you like it,41,,OLIVER,Enter CELIA and ROSALIND
15918,As you like it,1,1.2.1,CELIA,"I pray thee, Rosalind, sweet my coz, be merry."
15919,As you like it,2,1.2.2,ROSALIND,"Dear Celia, I show more mirth than I am mistress of,"
15920,As you like it,2,1.2.3,ROSALIND,and would you yet I were merrier? Unless you could
15921,As you like it,2,1.2.4,ROSALIND,"teach me to forget a banished father, you must not"
15922,As you like it,2,1.2.5,ROSALIND,learn me how to remember any extraordinary pleasure.
15923,As you like it,3,1.2.6,CELIA,Herein I see thou lovest me not with the full weight
15924,As you like it,3,1.2.7,CELIA,"that I love thee. If my uncle, thy banished father,"
15925,As you like it,3,1.2.8,CELIA,"had banished thy uncle, the duke my father, so thou"
15926,As you like it,3,1.2.9,CELIA,"hadst been still with me, I could have taught my"
15927,As you like it,3,1.2.10,CELIA,"love to take thy father for mine: so wouldst thou,"
15928,As you like it,3,1.2.11,CELIA,if the truth of thy love to me were so righteously
15929,As you like it,3,1.2.12,CELIA,tempered as mine is to thee.
15930,As you like it,4,1.2.13,ROSALIND,"Well, I will forget the condition of my estate, to"
15931,As you like it,4,1.2.14,ROSALIND,rejoice in yours.
15932,As you like it,5,1.2.15,CELIA,"You know my father hath no child but I, nor none is"
15933,As you like it,5,1.2.16,CELIA,"like to have: and, truly, when he dies, thou shalt"
15934,As you like it,5,1.2.17,CELIA,"be his heir, for what he hath taken away from thy"
15935,As you like it,5,1.2.18,CELIA,"father perforce, I will render thee again in"
15936,As you like it,5,1.2.19,CELIA,"affection, by mine honour, I will, and when I break"
15937,As you like it,5,1.2.20,CELIA,"that oath, let me turn monster: therefore, my"
15938,As you like it,5,1.2.21,CELIA,"sweet Rose, my dear Rose, be merry."
15939,As you like it,6,1.2.22,ROSALIND,"From henceforth I will, coz, and devise sports. Let"
15940,As you like it,6,1.2.23,ROSALIND,"me see, what think you of falling in love?"
15941,As you like it,7,1.2.24,CELIA,"Marry, I prithee, do, to make sport withal: but"
15942,As you like it,7,1.2.25,CELIA,"love no man in good earnest, nor no further in sport"
15943,As you like it,7,1.2.26,CELIA,neither than with safety of a pure blush thou mayst
15944,As you like it,7,1.2.27,CELIA,in honour come off again.
15945,As you like it,8,1.2.28,ROSALIND,"What shall be our sport, then?"
15946,As you like it,9,1.2.29,CELIA,Let us sit and mock the good housewife Fortune from
15947,As you like it,9,1.2.30,CELIA,"her wheel, that her gifts may henceforth be bestowed equally."
15948,As you like it,10,1.2.31,ROSALIND,"I would we could do so, for her benefits are"
15949,As you like it,10,1.2.32,ROSALIND,"mightily misplaced, and the bountiful blind woman"
15950,As you like it,10,1.2.33,ROSALIND,doth most mistake in her gifts to women.
15951,As you like it,11,1.2.34,CELIA,"'Tis true, for those that she makes fair she scarce"
15952,As you like it,11,1.2.35,CELIA,"makes honest, and those that she makes honest she"
15953,As you like it,11,1.2.36,CELIA,makes very ill-favouredly.
15954,As you like it,12,1.2.37,ROSALIND,"Nay, now thou goest from Fortune's office to"
15955,As you like it,12,1.2.38,ROSALIND,"Nature's: Fortune reigns in gifts of the world,"
15956,As you like it,12,1.2.39,ROSALIND,not in the lineaments of Nature.
15957,As you like it,12,,ROSALIND,Enter TOUCHSTONE
15958,As you like it,13,1.2.40,CELIA,"No? when Nature hath made a fair creature, may she"
15959,As you like it,13,1.2.41,CELIA,not by Fortune fall into the fire? Though Nature
15960,As you like it,13,1.2.42,CELIA,"hath given us wit to flout at Fortune, hath not"
15961,As you like it,13,1.2.43,CELIA,Fortune sent in this fool to cut off the argument?
15962,As you like it,14,1.2.44,ROSALIND,"Indeed, there is Fortune too hard for Nature, when"
15963,As you like it,14,1.2.45,ROSALIND,Fortune makes Nature's natural the cutter-off of
15964,As you like it,14,1.2.46,ROSALIND,Nature's wit.
15965,As you like it,15,1.2.47,CELIA,"Peradventure this is not Fortune's work neither, but"
15966,As you like it,15,1.2.48,CELIA,"Nature's, who perceiveth our natural wits too dull"
15967,As you like it,15,1.2.49,CELIA,to reason of such goddesses and hath sent this
15968,As you like it,15,1.2.50,CELIA,"natural for our whetstone, for always the dulness of"
15969,As you like it,15,1.2.51,CELIA,"the fool is the whetstone of the wits. How now,"
15970,As you like it,15,1.2.52,CELIA,wit! whither wander you?
15971,As you like it,16,1.2.53,TOUCHSTONE,"Mistress, you must come away to your father."
15972,As you like it,17,1.2.54,CELIA,Were you made the messenger?
15973,As you like it,18,1.2.55,TOUCHSTONE,"No, by mine honour, but I was bid to come for you."
15974,As you like it,19,1.2.56,ROSALIND,"Where learned you that oath, fool?"
15975,As you like it,20,1.2.57,TOUCHSTONE,Of a certain knight that swore by his honour they
15976,As you like it,20,1.2.58,TOUCHSTONE,were good pancakes and swore by his honour the
15977,As you like it,20,1.2.59,TOUCHSTONE,"mustard was naught: now I'll stand to it, the"
15978,As you like it,20,1.2.60,TOUCHSTONE,"pancakes were naught and the mustard was good, and"
15979,As you like it,20,1.2.61,TOUCHSTONE,yet was not the knight forsworn.
15980,As you like it,21,1.2.62,CELIA,"How prove you that, in the great heap of your"
15981,As you like it,21,1.2.63,CELIA,knowledge?
15982,As you like it,22,1.2.64,ROSALIND,"Ay, marry, now unmuzzle your wisdom."
15983,As you like it,23,1.2.65,TOUCHSTONE,"Stand you both forth now: stroke your chins, and"
15984,As you like it,23,1.2.66,TOUCHSTONE,swear by your beards that I am a knave.
15985,As you like it,24,1.2.67,CELIA,"By our beards, if we had them, thou art."
15986,As you like it,25,1.2.68,TOUCHSTONE,"By my knavery, if I had it, then I were, but if you"
15987,As you like it,25,1.2.69,TOUCHSTONE,"swear by that that is not, you are not forsworn: no"
15988,As you like it,25,1.2.70,TOUCHSTONE,"more was this knight swearing by his honour, for he"
15989,As you like it,25,1.2.71,TOUCHSTONE,"never had any, or if he had, he had sworn it away"
15990,As you like it,25,1.2.72,TOUCHSTONE,before ever he saw those pancakes or that mustard.
15991,As you like it,26,1.2.73,CELIA,"Prithee, who is't that thou meanest?"
15992,As you like it,27,1.2.74,TOUCHSTONE,"One that old Frederick, your father, loves."
15993,As you like it,28,1.2.75,CELIA,My father's love is enough to honour him: enough!
15994,As you like it,28,1.2.76,CELIA,"speak no more of him, you'll be whipped for taxation"
15995,As you like it,28,1.2.77,CELIA,one of these days.
15996,As you like it,29,1.2.78,TOUCHSTONE,"The more pity, that fools may not speak wisely what"
15997,As you like it,29,1.2.79,TOUCHSTONE,wise men do foolishly.
15998,As you like it,30,1.2.80,CELIA,"By my troth, thou sayest true, for since the little"
15999,As you like it,30,1.2.81,CELIA,"wit that fools have was silenced, the little foolery"
16000,As you like it,30,1.2.82,CELIA,that wise men have makes a great show. Here comes
16001,As you like it,30,1.2.83,CELIA,Monsieur Le Beau.
16002,As you like it,31,1.2.84,ROSALIND,With his mouth full of news.
16003,As you like it,32,1.2.85,CELIA,"Which he will put on us, as pigeons feed their young."
16004,As you like it,33,1.2.86,ROSALIND,Then shall we be news-crammed.
16005,As you like it,34,1.2.87,CELIA,"All the better, we shall be the more marketable."
16006,As you like it,34,,CELIA,Enter LE BEAU
16007,As you like it,34,1.2.88,CELIA,"Bon jour, Monsieur Le Beau: what's the news?"
16008,As you like it,35,1.2.89,LE BEAU,"Fair princess, you have lost much good sport."
16009,As you like it,36,1.2.90,CELIA,Sport! of what colour?
16010,As you like it,37,1.2.91,LE BEAU,"What colour, madam! how shall I answer you?"
16011,As you like it,38,1.2.92,ROSALIND,As wit and fortune will.
16012,As you like it,39,1.2.93,TOUCHSTONE,Or as the Destinies decree.
16013,As you like it,40,1.2.94,CELIA,Well said: that was laid on with a trowel.
16014,As you like it,41,1.2.95,TOUCHSTONE,"Nay, if I keep not my rank,--"
16015,As you like it,42,1.2.96,ROSALIND,Thou losest thy old smell.
16016,As you like it,43,1.2.97,LE BEAU,"You amaze me, ladies: I would have told you of good"
16017,As you like it,43,1.2.98,LE BEAU,"wrestling, which you have lost the sight of."
16018,As you like it,44,1.2.99,ROSALIND,You tell us the manner of the wrestling.
16019,As you like it,45,1.2.100,LE BEAU,"I will tell you the beginning, and, if it please"
16020,As you like it,45,1.2.101,LE BEAU,"your ladyships, you may see the end, for the best is"
16021,As you like it,45,1.2.102,LE BEAU,"yet to do, and here, where you are, they are coming"
16022,As you like it,45,1.2.103,LE BEAU,to perform it.
16023,As you like it,46,1.2.104,CELIA,"Well, the beginning, that is dead and buried."
16024,As you like it,47,1.2.105,LE BEAU,"There comes an old man and his three sons,--"
16025,As you like it,48,1.2.106,CELIA,I could match this beginning with an old tale.
16026,As you like it,49,1.2.107,LE BEAU,"Three proper young men, of excellent growth and presence."
16027,As you like it,50,1.2.108,ROSALIND,"With bills on their necks, 'Be it known unto all men"
16028,As you like it,50,1.2.109,ROSALIND,by these presents.'
16029,As you like it,51,1.2.110,LE BEAU,"The eldest of the three wrestled with Charles, the"
16030,As you like it,51,1.2.111,LE BEAU,"duke's wrestler, which Charles in a moment threw him"
16031,As you like it,51,1.2.112,LE BEAU,"and broke three of his ribs, that there is little"
16032,As you like it,51,1.2.113,LE BEAU,"hope of life in him: so he served the second, and"
16033,As you like it,51,1.2.114,LE BEAU,"so the third. Yonder they lie, the poor old man,"
16034,As you like it,51,1.2.115,LE BEAU,"their father, making such pitiful dole over them"
16035,As you like it,51,1.2.116,LE BEAU,that all the beholders take his part with weeping.
16036,As you like it,52,1.2.117,ROSALIND,Alas!
16037,As you like it,53,1.2.118,TOUCHSTONE,"But what is the sport, monsieur, that the ladies"
16038,As you like it,53,1.2.119,TOUCHSTONE,have lost?
16039,As you like it,54,1.2.120,LE BEAU,"Why, this that I speak of."
16040,As you like it,55,1.2.121,TOUCHSTONE,Thus men may grow wiser every day: it is the first
16041,As you like it,55,1.2.122,TOUCHSTONE,time that ever I heard breaking of ribs was sport
16042,As you like it,55,1.2.123,TOUCHSTONE,for ladies.
16043,As you like it,56,1.2.124,CELIA,"Or I, I promise thee."
16044,As you like it,57,1.2.125,ROSALIND,But is there any else longs to see this broken music
16045,As you like it,57,1.2.126,ROSALIND,in his sides? is there yet another dotes upon
16046,As you like it,57,1.2.127,ROSALIND,"rib-breaking? Shall we see this wrestling, cousin?"
16047,As you like it,58,1.2.128,LE BEAU,"You must, if you stay here, for here is the place"
16048,As you like it,58,1.2.129,LE BEAU,"appointed for the wrestling, and they are ready to"
16049,As you like it,58,1.2.130,LE BEAU,perform it.
16050,As you like it,59,1.2.131,CELIA,"Yonder, sure, they are coming: let us now stay and see it."
16051,As you like it,59,,CELIA,"Flourish. Enter DUKE FREDERICK, Lords, ORLANDO, CHARLES, and Attendants"
16052,As you like it,60,1.2.132,DUKE FREDERICK,"Come on: since the youth will not be entreated, his"
16053,As you like it,60,1.2.133,DUKE FREDERICK,own peril on his forwardness.
16054,As you like it,61,1.2.134,ROSALIND,Is yonder the man?
16055,As you like it,62,1.2.135,LE BEAU,"Even he, madam."
16056,As you like it,63,1.2.136,CELIA,"Alas, he is too young! yet he looks successfully."
16057,As you like it,64,1.2.137,DUKE FREDERICK,"How now, daughter and cousin! are you crept hither"
16058,As you like it,64,1.2.138,DUKE FREDERICK,to see the wrestling?
16059,As you like it,65,1.2.139,ROSALIND,"Ay, my liege, so please you give us leave."
16060,As you like it,66,1.2.140,DUKE FREDERICK,"You will take little delight in it, I can tell you,"
16061,As you like it,66,1.2.141,DUKE FREDERICK,there is such odds in the man. In pity of the
16062,As you like it,66,1.2.142,DUKE FREDERICK,"challenger's youth I would fain dissuade him, but he"
16063,As you like it,66,1.2.143,DUKE FREDERICK,"will not be entreated. Speak to him, ladies, see if"
16064,As you like it,66,1.2.144,DUKE FREDERICK,you can move him.
16065,As you like it,67,1.2.145,CELIA,"Call him hither, good Monsieur Le Beau."
16066,As you like it,68,1.2.146,DUKE FREDERICK,Do so: I'll not be by.
16067,As you like it,69,1.2.147,LE BEAU,"Monsieur the challenger, the princesses call for you."
16068,As you like it,70,1.2.148,ORLANDO,I attend them with all respect and duty.
16069,As you like it,71,1.2.149,ROSALIND,"Young man, have you challenged Charles the wrestler?"
16070,As you like it,72,1.2.150,ORLANDO,"No, fair princess, he is the general challenger: I"
16071,As you like it,72,1.2.151,ORLANDO,"come but in, as others do, to try with him the"
16072,As you like it,72,1.2.152,ORLANDO,strength of my youth.
16073,As you like it,73,1.2.153,CELIA,"Young gentleman, your spirits are too bold for your"
16074,As you like it,73,1.2.154,CELIA,years. You have seen cruel proof of this man's
16075,As you like it,73,1.2.155,CELIA,strength: if you saw yourself with your eyes or
16076,As you like it,73,1.2.156,CELIA,"knew yourself with your judgment, the fear of your"
16077,As you like it,73,1.2.157,CELIA,adventure would counsel you to a more equal
16078,As you like it,73,1.2.158,CELIA,"enterprise. We pray you, for your own sake, to"
16079,As you like it,73,1.2.159,CELIA,embrace your own safety and give over this attempt.
16080,As you like it,74,1.2.160,ROSALIND,"Do, young sir, your reputation shall not therefore"
16081,As you like it,74,1.2.161,ROSALIND,be misprised: we will make it our suit to the duke
16082,As you like it,74,1.2.162,ROSALIND,that the wrestling might not go forward.
16083,As you like it,75,1.2.163,ORLANDO,"I beseech you, punish me not with your hard"
16084,As you like it,75,1.2.164,ORLANDO,"thoughts, wherein I confess me much guilty, to deny"
16085,As you like it,75,1.2.165,ORLANDO,so fair and excellent ladies any thing. But let
16086,As you like it,75,1.2.166,ORLANDO,your fair eyes and gentle wishes go with me to my
16087,As you like it,75,1.2.167,ORLANDO,"trial: wherein if I be foiled, there is but one"
16088,As you like it,75,1.2.168,ORLANDO,"shamed that was never gracious, if killed, but one"
16089,As you like it,75,1.2.169,ORLANDO,dead that was willing to be so: I shall do my
16090,As you like it,75,1.2.170,ORLANDO,"friends no wrong, for I have none to lament me, the"
16091,As you like it,75,1.2.171,ORLANDO,"world no injury, for in it I have nothing, only in"
16092,As you like it,75,1.2.172,ORLANDO,"the world I fill up a place, which may be better"
16093,As you like it,75,1.2.173,ORLANDO,supplied when I have made it empty.
16094,As you like it,76,1.2.174,ROSALIND,"The little strength that I have, I would it were with you."
16095,As you like it,77,1.2.175,CELIA,"And mine, to eke out hers."
16096,As you like it,78,1.2.176,ROSALIND,Fare you well: pray heaven I be deceived in you!
16097,As you like it,79,1.2.177,CELIA,Your heart's desires be with you!
16098,As you like it,80,1.2.178,CHARLES,"Come, where is this young gallant that is so"
16099,As you like it,80,1.2.179,CHARLES,desirous to lie with his mother earth?
16100,As you like it,81,1.2.180,ORLANDO,"Ready, sir, but his will hath in it a more modest working."
16101,As you like it,82,1.2.181,DUKE FREDERICK,You shall try but one fall.
16102,As you like it,83,1.2.182,CHARLES,"No, I warrant your grace, you shall not entreat him"
16103,As you like it,83,1.2.183,CHARLES,"to a second, that have so mightily persuaded him"
16104,As you like it,83,1.2.184,CHARLES,from a first.
16105,As you like it,84,1.2.185,ORLANDO,"An you mean to mock me after, you should not have"
16106,As you like it,84,1.2.186,ORLANDO,mocked me before: but come your ways.
16107,As you like it,85,1.2.187,ROSALIND,"Now Hercules be thy speed, young man!"
16108,As you like it,86,1.2.188,CELIA,"I would I were invisible, to catch the strong"
16109,As you like it,86,1.2.189,CELIA,fellow by the leg.
16110,As you like it,86,,CELIA,They wrestle
16111,As you like it,87,1.2.190,ROSALIND,O excellent young man!
16112,As you like it,88,1.2.191,CELIA,"If I had a thunderbolt in mine eye, I can tell who"
16113,As you like it,88,1.2.192,CELIA,should down.
16114,As you like it,88,,CELIA,Shout. CHARLES is thrown
16115,As you like it,89,1.2.193,DUKE FREDERICK,"No more, no more."
16116,As you like it,90,1.2.194,ORLANDO,"Yes, I beseech your grace: I am not yet well breathed."
16117,As you like it,91,1.2.195,DUKE FREDERICK,"How dost thou, Charles?"
16118,As you like it,92,1.2.196,LE BEAU,"He cannot speak, my lord."
16119,As you like it,93,1.2.197,DUKE FREDERICK,"Bear him away. What is thy name, young man?"
16120,As you like it,94,1.2.198,ORLANDO,"Orlando, my liege, the youngest son of Sir Rowland de Boys."
16121,As you like it,95,1.2.199,DUKE FREDERICK,I would thou hadst been son to some man else:
16122,As you like it,95,1.2.200,DUKE FREDERICK,"The world esteem'd thy father honourable,"
16123,As you like it,95,1.2.201,DUKE FREDERICK,But I did find him still mine enemy:
16124,As you like it,95,1.2.202,DUKE FREDERICK,"Thou shouldst have better pleased me with this deed,"
16125,As you like it,95,1.2.203,DUKE FREDERICK,Hadst thou descended from another house.
16126,As you like it,95,1.2.204,DUKE FREDERICK,"But fare thee well, thou art a gallant youth:"
16127,As you like it,95,1.2.205,DUKE FREDERICK,I would thou hadst told me of another father.
16128,As you like it,95,,DUKE FREDERICK,"Exeunt DUKE FREDERICK, train, and LE BEAU"
16129,As you like it,96,1.2.206,CELIA,"Were I my father, coz, would I do this?"
16130,As you like it,97,1.2.207,ORLANDO,"I am more proud to be Sir Rowland's son,"
16131,As you like it,97,1.2.208,ORLANDO,"His youngest son, and would not change that calling,"
16132,As you like it,97,1.2.209,ORLANDO,To be adopted heir to Frederick.
16133,As you like it,98,1.2.210,ROSALIND,"My father loved Sir Rowland as his soul,"
16134,As you like it,98,1.2.211,ROSALIND,And all the world was of my father's mind:
16135,As you like it,98,1.2.212,ROSALIND,"Had I before known this young man his son,"
16136,As you like it,98,1.2.213,ROSALIND,"I should have given him tears unto entreaties,"
16137,As you like it,98,1.2.214,ROSALIND,Ere he should thus have ventured.
16138,As you like it,99,1.2.215,CELIA,"Gentle cousin,"
16139,As you like it,99,1.2.216,CELIA,Let us go thank him and encourage him:
16140,As you like it,99,1.2.217,CELIA,My father's rough and envious disposition
16141,As you like it,99,1.2.218,CELIA,"Sticks me at heart. Sir, you have well deserved:"
16142,As you like it,99,1.2.219,CELIA,If you do keep your promises in love
16143,As you like it,99,1.2.220,CELIA,"But justly, as you have exceeded all promise,"
16144,As you like it,99,1.2.221,CELIA,Your mistress shall be happy.
16145,As you like it,100,1.2.222,ROSALIND,"Gentleman,"
16146,As you like it,100,,ROSALIND,Giving him a chain from her neck
16147,As you like it,100,1.2.223,ROSALIND,"Wear this for me, one out of suits with fortune,"
16148,As you like it,100,1.2.224,ROSALIND,"That could give more, but that her hand lacks means."
16149,As you like it,100,1.2.225,ROSALIND,"Shall we go, coz?"
16150,As you like it,101,1.2.226,CELIA,"Ay. Fare you well, fair gentleman."
16151,As you like it,102,1.2.227,ORLANDO,"Can I not say, I thank you? My better parts"
16152,As you like it,102,1.2.228,ORLANDO,"Are all thrown down, and that which here stands up"
16153,As you like it,102,1.2.229,ORLANDO,"Is but a quintain, a mere lifeless block."
16154,As you like it,103,1.2.230,ROSALIND,"He calls us back: my pride fell with my fortunes,"
16155,As you like it,103,1.2.231,ROSALIND,"I'll ask him what he would. Did you call, sir?"
16156,As you like it,103,1.2.232,ROSALIND,"Sir, you have wrestled well and overthrown"
16157,As you like it,103,1.2.233,ROSALIND,More than your enemies.
16158,As you like it,104,1.2.234,CELIA,"Will you go, coz?"
16159,As you like it,105,1.2.235,ROSALIND,Have with you. Fare you well.
16160,As you like it,105,,ROSALIND,Exeunt ROSALIND and CELIA
16161,As you like it,106,1.2.236,ORLANDO,What passion hangs these weights upon my tongue?
16162,As you like it,106,1.2.237,ORLANDO,"I cannot speak to her, yet she urged conference."
16163,As you like it,106,1.2.238,ORLANDO,"O poor Orlando, thou art overthrown!"
16164,As you like it,106,1.2.239,ORLANDO,Or Charles or something weaker masters thee.
16165,As you like it,106,,ORLANDO,Re-enter LE BEAU
16166,As you like it,107,1.2.240,LE BEAU,"Good sir, I do in friendship counsel you"
16167,As you like it,107,1.2.241,LE BEAU,To leave this place. Albeit you have deserved
16168,As you like it,107,1.2.242,LE BEAU,"High commendation, true applause and love,"
16169,As you like it,107,1.2.243,LE BEAU,Yet such is now the duke's condition
16170,As you like it,107,1.2.244,LE BEAU,That he misconstrues all that you have done.
16171,As you like it,107,1.2.245,LE BEAU,"The duke is humorous, what he is indeed,"
16172,As you like it,107,1.2.246,LE BEAU,More suits you to conceive than I to speak of.
16173,As you like it,108,1.2.247,ORLANDO,"I thank you, sir: and, pray you, tell me this:"
16174,As you like it,108,1.2.248,ORLANDO,Which of the two was daughter of the duke
16175,As you like it,108,1.2.249,ORLANDO,That here was at the wrestling?
16176,As you like it,109,1.2.250,LE BEAU,"Neither his daughter, if we judge by manners,"
16177,As you like it,109,1.2.251,LE BEAU,But yet indeed the lesser is his daughter
16178,As you like it,109,1.2.252,LE BEAU,"The other is daughter to the banish'd duke,"
16179,As you like it,109,1.2.253,LE BEAU,"And here detain'd by her usurping uncle,"
16180,As you like it,109,1.2.254,LE BEAU,"To keep his daughter company, whose loves"
16181,As you like it,109,1.2.255,LE BEAU,Are dearer than the natural bond of sisters.
16182,As you like it,109,1.2.256,LE BEAU,But I can tell you that of late this duke
16183,As you like it,109,1.2.257,LE BEAU,"Hath ta'en displeasure 'gainst his gentle niece,"
16184,As you like it,109,1.2.258,LE BEAU,Grounded upon no other argument
16185,As you like it,109,1.2.259,LE BEAU,But that the people praise her for her virtues
16186,As you like it,109,1.2.260,LE BEAU,"And pity her for her good father's sake,"
16187,As you like it,109,1.2.261,LE BEAU,"And, on my life, his malice 'gainst the lady"
16188,As you like it,109,1.2.262,LE BEAU,"Will suddenly break forth. Sir, fare you well:"
16189,As you like it,109,1.2.263,LE BEAU,"Hereafter, in a better world than this,"
16190,As you like it,109,1.2.264,LE BEAU,I shall desire more love and knowledge of you.
16191,As you like it,110,1.2.265,ORLANDO,I rest much bounden to you: fare you well.
16192,As you like it,110,,ORLANDO,Exit LE BEAU
16193,As you like it,110,1.2.266,ORLANDO,"Thus must I from the smoke into the smother,"
16194,As you like it,110,1.2.267,ORLANDO,From tyrant duke unto a tyrant brother:
16195,As you like it,110,1.2.268,ORLANDO,But heavenly Rosalind!
16196,As you like it,110,,ORLANDO,Exit
16197,As you like it,110,,ORLANDO,SCENE III. A room in the palace.
16198,As you like it,110,,ORLANDO,Enter CELIA and ROSALIND
16199,As you like it,1,1.3.1,CELIA,"Why, cousin! why, Rosalind! Cupid have mercy! not a word?"
16200,As you like it,2,1.3.2,ROSALIND,Not one to throw at a dog.
16201,As you like it,3,1.3.3,CELIA,"No, thy words are too precious to be cast away upon"
16202,As you like it,3,1.3.4,CELIA,"curs, throw some of them at me, come, lame me with reasons."
16203,As you like it,4,1.3.5,ROSALIND,"Then there were two cousins laid up, when the one"
16204,As you like it,4,1.3.6,ROSALIND,should be lamed with reasons and the other mad
16205,As you like it,4,1.3.7,ROSALIND,without any.
16206,As you like it,5,1.3.8,CELIA,But is all this for your father?
16207,As you like it,6,1.3.9,ROSALIND,"No, some of it is for my child's father. O, how"
16208,As you like it,6,1.3.10,ROSALIND,full of briers is this working-day world!
16209,As you like it,7,1.3.11,CELIA,"They are but burs, cousin, thrown upon thee in"
16210,As you like it,7,1.3.12,CELIA,holiday foolery: if we walk not in the trodden
16211,As you like it,7,1.3.13,CELIA,paths our very petticoats will catch them.
16212,As you like it,8,1.3.14,ROSALIND,I could shake them off my coat: these burs are in my heart.
16213,As you like it,9,1.3.15,CELIA,Hem them away.
16214,As you like it,10,1.3.16,ROSALIND,"I would try, if I could cry 'hem' and have him."
16215,As you like it,11,1.3.17,CELIA,"Come, come, wrestle with thy affections."
16216,As you like it,12,1.3.18,ROSALIND,"O, they take the part of a better wrestler than myself!"
16217,As you like it,13,1.3.19,CELIA,"O, a good wish upon you! you will try in time, in"
16218,As you like it,13,1.3.20,CELIA,"despite of a fall. But, turning these jests out of"
16219,As you like it,13,1.3.21,CELIA,"service, let us talk in good earnest: is it"
16220,As you like it,13,1.3.22,CELIA,"possible, on such a sudden, you should fall into so"
16221,As you like it,13,1.3.23,CELIA,strong a liking with old Sir Rowland's youngest son?
16222,As you like it,14,1.3.24,ROSALIND,The duke my father loved his father dearly.
16223,As you like it,15,1.3.25,CELIA,Doth it therefore ensue that you should love his son
16224,As you like it,15,1.3.26,CELIA,"dearly? By this kind of chase, I should hate him,"
16225,As you like it,15,1.3.27,CELIA,"for my father hated his father dearly, yet I hate"
16226,As you like it,15,1.3.28,CELIA,not Orlando.
16227,As you like it,16,1.3.29,ROSALIND,"No, faith, hate him not, for my sake."
16228,As you like it,17,1.3.30,CELIA,Why should I not? doth he not deserve well?
16229,As you like it,18,1.3.31,ROSALIND,"Let me love him for that, and do you love him"
16230,As you like it,18,1.3.32,ROSALIND,"because I do. Look, here comes the duke."
16231,As you like it,19,1.3.33,CELIA,With his eyes full of anger.
16232,As you like it,19,,CELIA,"Enter DUKE FREDERICK, with Lords"
16233,As you like it,20,1.3.34,DUKE FREDERICK,"Mistress, dispatch you with your safest haste"
16234,As you like it,20,1.3.35,DUKE FREDERICK,And get you from our court.
16235,As you like it,21,1.3.36,ROSALIND,"Me, uncle?"
16236,As you like it,22,1.3.37,DUKE FREDERICK,"You, cousin"
16237,As you like it,22,1.3.38,DUKE FREDERICK,Within these ten days if that thou be'st found
16238,As you like it,22,1.3.39,DUKE FREDERICK,"So near our public court as twenty miles,"
16239,As you like it,22,1.3.40,DUKE FREDERICK,Thou diest for it.
16240,As you like it,23,1.3.41,ROSALIND,"I do beseech your grace,"
16241,As you like it,23,1.3.42,ROSALIND,Let me the knowledge of my fault bear with me:
16242,As you like it,23,1.3.43,ROSALIND,If with myself I hold intelligence
16243,As you like it,23,1.3.44,ROSALIND,"Or have acquaintance with mine own desires,"
16244,As you like it,23,1.3.45,ROSALIND,"If that I do not dream or be not frantic,--"
16245,As you like it,23,1.3.46,ROSALIND,"As I do trust I am not--then, dear uncle,"
16246,As you like it,23,1.3.47,ROSALIND,Never so much as in a thought unborn
16247,As you like it,23,1.3.48,ROSALIND,Did I offend your highness.
16248,As you like it,24,1.3.49,DUKE FREDERICK,Thus do all traitors:
16249,As you like it,24,1.3.50,DUKE FREDERICK,"If their purgation did consist in words,"
16250,As you like it,24,1.3.51,DUKE FREDERICK,They are as innocent as grace itself:
16251,As you like it,24,1.3.52,DUKE FREDERICK,Let it suffice thee that I trust thee not.
16252,As you like it,25,1.3.53,ROSALIND,Yet your mistrust cannot make me a traitor:
16253,As you like it,25,1.3.54,ROSALIND,Tell me whereon the likelihood depends.
16254,As you like it,26,1.3.55,DUKE FREDERICK,"Thou art thy father's daughter, there's enough."
16255,As you like it,27,1.3.56,ROSALIND,"So was I when your highness took his dukedom,"
16256,As you like it,27,1.3.57,ROSALIND,So was I when your highness banish'd him:
16257,As you like it,27,1.3.58,ROSALIND,"Treason is not inherited, my lord,"
16258,As you like it,27,1.3.59,ROSALIND,"Or, if we did derive it from our friends,"
16259,As you like it,27,1.3.60,ROSALIND,What's that to me? my father was no traitor:
16260,As you like it,27,1.3.61,ROSALIND,"Then, good my liege, mistake me not so much"
16261,As you like it,27,1.3.62,ROSALIND,To think my poverty is treacherous.
16262,As you like it,28,1.3.63,CELIA,"Dear sovereign, hear me speak."
16263,As you like it,29,1.3.64,DUKE FREDERICK,"Ay, Celia, we stay'd her for your sake,"
16264,As you like it,29,1.3.65,DUKE FREDERICK,Else had she with her father ranged along.
16265,As you like it,30,1.3.66,CELIA,"I did not then entreat to have her stay,"
16266,As you like it,30,1.3.67,CELIA,It was your pleasure and your own remorse:
16267,As you like it,30,1.3.68,CELIA,"I was too young that time to value her,"
16268,As you like it,30,1.3.69,CELIA,"But now I know her: if she be a traitor,"
16269,As you like it,30,1.3.70,CELIA,"Why so am I, we still have slept together,"
16270,As you like it,30,1.3.71,CELIA,"Rose at an instant, learn'd, play'd, eat together,"
16271,As you like it,30,1.3.72,CELIA,"And wheresoever we went, like Juno's swans,"
16272,As you like it,30,1.3.73,CELIA,Still we went coupled and inseparable.
16273,As you like it,31,1.3.74,DUKE FREDERICK,"She is too subtle for thee, and her smoothness,"
16274,As you like it,31,1.3.75,DUKE FREDERICK,Her very silence and her patience
16275,As you like it,31,1.3.76,DUKE FREDERICK,"Speak to the people, and they pity her."
16276,As you like it,31,1.3.77,DUKE FREDERICK,"Thou art a fool: she robs thee of thy name,"
16277,As you like it,31,1.3.78,DUKE FREDERICK,And thou wilt show more bright and seem more virtuous
16278,As you like it,31,1.3.79,DUKE FREDERICK,When she is gone. Then open not thy lips:
16279,As you like it,31,1.3.80,DUKE FREDERICK,Firm and irrevocable is my doom
16280,As you like it,31,1.3.81,DUKE FREDERICK,"Which I have pass'd upon her, she is banish'd."
16281,As you like it,32,1.3.82,CELIA,"Pronounce that sentence then on me, my liege:"
16282,As you like it,32,1.3.83,CELIA,I cannot live out of her company.
16283,As you like it,33,1.3.84,DUKE FREDERICK,"You are a fool. You, niece, provide yourself:"
16284,As you like it,33,1.3.85,DUKE FREDERICK,"If you outstay the time, upon mine honour,"
16285,As you like it,33,1.3.86,DUKE FREDERICK,"And in the greatness of my word, you die."
16286,As you like it,33,,DUKE FREDERICK,Exeunt DUKE FREDERICK and Lords
16287,As you like it,34,1.3.87,CELIA,"O my poor Rosalind, whither wilt thou go?"
16288,As you like it,34,1.3.88,CELIA,Wilt thou change fathers? I will give thee mine.
16289,As you like it,34,1.3.89,CELIA,"I charge thee, be not thou more grieved than I am."
16290,As you like it,35,1.3.90,ROSALIND,I have more cause.
16291,As you like it,36,1.3.91,CELIA,"Thou hast not, cousin,"
16292,As you like it,36,1.3.92,CELIA,"Prithee be cheerful: know'st thou not, the duke"
16293,As you like it,36,1.3.93,CELIA,"Hath banish'd me, his daughter?"
16294,As you like it,37,1.3.94,ROSALIND,That he hath not.
16295,As you like it,38,1.3.95,CELIA,"No, hath not? Rosalind lacks then the love"
16296,As you like it,38,1.3.96,CELIA,Which teacheth thee that thou and I am one:
16297,As you like it,38,1.3.97,CELIA,"Shall we be sunder'd? shall we part, sweet girl?"
16298,As you like it,38,1.3.98,CELIA,No: let my father seek another heir.
16299,As you like it,38,1.3.99,CELIA,"Therefore devise with me how we may fly,"
16300,As you like it,38,1.3.100,CELIA,"Whither to go and what to bear with us,"
16301,As you like it,38,1.3.101,CELIA,"And do not seek to take your change upon you,"
16302,As you like it,38,1.3.102,CELIA,"To bear your griefs yourself and leave me out,"
16303,As you like it,38,1.3.103,CELIA,"For, by this heaven, now at our sorrows pale,"
16304,As you like it,38,1.3.104,CELIA,"Say what thou canst, I'll go along with thee."
16305,As you like it,39,1.3.105,ROSALIND,"Why, whither shall we go?"
16306,As you like it,40,1.3.106,CELIA,To seek my uncle in the forest of Arden.
16307,As you like it,41,1.3.107,ROSALIND,"Alas, what danger will it be to us,"
16308,As you like it,41,1.3.108,ROSALIND,"Maids as we are, to travel forth so far!"
16309,As you like it,41,1.3.109,ROSALIND,Beauty provoketh thieves sooner than gold.
16310,As you like it,42,1.3.110,CELIA,I'll put myself in poor and mean attire
16311,As you like it,42,1.3.111,CELIA,"And with a kind of umber smirch my face,"
16312,As you like it,42,1.3.112,CELIA,The like do you: so shall we pass along
16313,As you like it,42,1.3.113,CELIA,And never stir assailants.
16314,As you like it,43,1.3.114,ROSALIND,"Were it not better,"
16315,As you like it,43,1.3.115,ROSALIND,"Because that I am more than common tall,"
16316,As you like it,43,1.3.116,ROSALIND,That I did suit me all points like a man?
16317,As you like it,43,1.3.117,ROSALIND,"A gallant curtle-axe upon my thigh,"
16318,As you like it,43,1.3.118,ROSALIND,"A boar-spear in my hand, and--in my heart"
16319,As you like it,43,1.3.119,ROSALIND,Lie there what hidden woman's fear there will--

16321,As you like it,43,1.3.121,ROSALIND,As many other mannish cowards have
16322,As you like it,43,1.3.122,ROSALIND,That do outface it with their semblances.
16323,As you like it,44,1.3.123,CELIA,What shall I call thee when thou art a man?
16324,As you like it,45,1.3.124,ROSALIND,"I'll have no worse a name than Jove's own page,"
16325,As you like it,45,1.3.125,ROSALIND,And therefore look you call me Ganymede.
16326,As you like it,45,1.3.126,ROSALIND,But what will you be call'd?
16327,As you like it,46,1.3.127,CELIA,Something that hath a reference to my state
16328,As you like it,46,1.3.128,CELIA,"No longer Celia, but Aliena."
16329,As you like it,47,1.3.129,ROSALIND,"But, cousin, what if we assay'd to steal"
16330,As you like it,47,1.3.130,ROSALIND,The clownish fool out of your father's court?
16331,As you like it,47,1.3.131,ROSALIND,Would he not be a comfort to our travel?
16332,As you like it,48,1.3.132,CELIA,"He'll go along o'er the wide world with me,"
16333,As you like it,48,1.3.133,CELIA,"Leave me alone to woo him. Let's away,"
16334,As you like it,48,1.3.134,CELIA,"And get our jewels and our wealth together,"
16335,As you like it,48,1.3.135,CELIA,Devise the fittest time and safest way
16336,As you like it,48,1.3.136,CELIA,To hide us from pursuit that will be made
16337,As you like it,48,1.3.137,CELIA,After my flight. Now go we in content
16338,As you like it,48,1.3.138,CELIA,To liberty and not to banishment.

16343,As you like it,1,2.1.1,DUKE SENIOR,"Now, my co-mates and brothers in exile,"
16344,As you like it,1,2.1.2,DUKE SENIOR,Hath not old custom made this life more sweet
16345,As you like it,1,2.1.3,DUKE SENIOR,Than that of painted pomp? Are not these woods
16346,As you like it,1,2.1.4,DUKE SENIOR,More free from peril than the envious court?
16347,As you like it,1,2.1.5,DUKE SENIOR,"Here feel we but the penalty of Adam,"
16348,As you like it,1,2.1.6,DUKE SENIOR,"The seasons' difference, as the icy fang"
16349,As you like it,1,2.1.7,DUKE SENIOR,"And churlish chiding of the winter's wind,"
16350,As you like it,1,2.1.8,DUKE SENIOR,"Which, when it bites and blows upon my body,"
16351,As you like it,1,2.1.9,DUKE SENIOR,"Even till I shrink with cold, I smile and say"
16352,As you like it,1,2.1.10,DUKE SENIOR,'This is no flattery: these are counsellors
16353,As you like it,1,2.1.11,DUKE SENIOR,That feelingly persuade me what I am.'
16354,As you like it,1,2.1.12,DUKE SENIOR,"Sweet are the uses of adversity,"
16355,As you like it,1,2.1.13,DUKE SENIOR,"Which, like the toad, ugly and venomous,"

16357,As you like it,1,2.1.15,DUKE SENIOR,And this our life exempt from public haunt
16358,As you like it,1,2.1.16,DUKE SENIOR,"Finds tongues in trees, books in the running brooks,"
16359,As you like it,1,2.1.17,DUKE SENIOR,Sermons in stones and good in every thing.
16360,As you like it,1,2.1.18,DUKE SENIOR,I would not change it.
16361,As you like it,2,2.1.19,AMIENS,"Happy is your grace,"
16362,As you like it,2,2.1.20,AMIENS,That can translate the stubbornness of fortune
16363,As you like it,2,2.1.21,AMIENS,Into so quiet and so sweet a style.
16364,As you like it,3,2.1.22,DUKE SENIOR,"Come, shall we go and kill us venison?"
16365,As you like it,3,2.1.23,DUKE SENIOR,"And yet it irks me the poor dappled fools,"
16366,As you like it,3,2.1.24,DUKE SENIOR,"Being native burghers of this desert city,"
16367,As you like it,3,2.1.25,DUKE SENIOR,Should in their own confines with forked heads
16368,As you like it,3,2.1.26,DUKE SENIOR,Have their round haunches gored.
16369,As you like it,4,2.1.27,First Lord,"Indeed, my lord,"
16370,As you like it,4,2.1.28,First Lord,"The melancholy Jaques grieves at that,"
16371,As you like it,4,2.1.29,First Lord,"And, in that kind, swears you do more usurp"
16372,As you like it,4,2.1.30,First Lord,Than doth your brother that hath banish'd you.
16373,As you like it,4,2.1.31,First Lord,To-day my Lord of Amiens and myself
16374,As you like it,4,2.1.32,First Lord,Did steal behind him as he lay along
16375,As you like it,4,2.1.33,First Lord,Under an oak whose antique root peeps out
16376,As you like it,4,2.1.34,First Lord,Upon the brook that brawls along this wood:
16377,As you like it,4,2.1.35,First Lord,"To the which place a poor sequester'd stag,"
16378,As you like it,4,2.1.36,First Lord,"That from the hunter's aim had ta'en a hurt,"
16379,As you like it,4,2.1.37,First Lord,"Did come to languish, and indeed, my lord,"
16380,As you like it,4,2.1.38,First Lord,The wretched animal heaved forth such groans
16381,As you like it,4,2.1.39,First Lord,That their discharge did stretch his leathern coat
16382,As you like it,4,2.1.40,First Lord,"Almost to bursting, and the big round tears"
16383,As you like it,4,2.1.41,First Lord,Coursed one another down his innocent nose
16384,As you like it,4,2.1.42,First Lord,"In piteous chase, and thus the hairy fool"
16385,As you like it,4,2.1.43,First Lord,"Much marked of the melancholy Jaques,"
16386,As you like it,4,2.1.44,First Lord,"Stood on the extremest verge of the swift brook,"
16387,As you like it,4,2.1.45,First Lord,Augmenting it with tears.
16388,As you like it,5,2.1.46,DUKE SENIOR,But what said Jaques?
16389,As you like it,5,2.1.47,DUKE SENIOR,Did he not moralize this spectacle?
16390,As you like it,6,2.1.48,First Lord,"O, yes, into a thousand similes."
16391,As you like it,6,2.1.49,First Lord,"First, for his weeping into the needless stream,"
16392,As you like it,6,2.1.50,First Lord,"'Poor deer,' quoth he, 'thou makest a testament"
16393,As you like it,6,2.1.51,First Lord,"As worldlings do, giving thy sum of more"
16394,As you like it,6,2.1.52,First Lord,"To that which had too much:' then, being there alone,"
16395,As you like it,6,2.1.53,First Lord,"Left and abandon'd of his velvet friends,"
16396,As you like it,6,2.1.54,First Lord,"''Tis right:' quoth he, 'thus misery doth part"
16397,As you like it,6,2.1.55,First Lord,"The flux of company:' anon a careless herd,"
16398,As you like it,6,2.1.56,First Lord,"Full of the pasture, jumps along by him"
16399,As you like it,6,2.1.57,First Lord,"And never stays to greet him, 'Ay' quoth Jaques,"
16400,As you like it,6,2.1.58,First Lord,"'Sweep on, you fat and greasy citizens,"
16401,As you like it,6,2.1.59,First Lord,'Tis just the fashion: wherefore do you look
16402,As you like it,6,2.1.60,First Lord,Upon that poor and broken bankrupt there?'
16403,As you like it,6,2.1.61,First Lord,Thus most invectively he pierceth through
16404,As you like it,6,2.1.62,First Lord,"The body of the country, city, court,"
16405,As you like it,6,2.1.63,First Lord,"Yea, and of this our life, swearing that we"
16406,As you like it,6,2.1.64,First Lord,"Are mere usurpers, tyrants and what's worse,"
16407,As you like it,6,2.1.65,First Lord,To fright the animals and to kill them up
16408,As you like it,6,2.1.66,First Lord,In their assign'd and native dwelling-place.
16409,As you like it,7,2.1.67,DUKE SENIOR,And did you leave him in this contemplation?
16410,As you like it,8,2.1.68,Second Lord,"We did, my lord, weeping and commenting"
16411,As you like it,8,2.1.69,Second Lord,Upon the sobbing deer.
16412,As you like it,9,2.1.70,DUKE SENIOR,Show me the place:
16413,As you like it,9,2.1.71,DUKE SENIOR,"I love to cope him in these sullen fits,"
16414,As you like it,9,2.1.72,DUKE SENIOR,For then he's full of matter.
16415,As you like it,10,2.1.73,First Lord,I'll bring you to him straight.
16416,As you like it,10,,First Lord,Exeunt
16417,As you like it,10,,First Lord,SCENE II. A room in the palace.
16418,As you like it,10,,First Lord,"Enter DUKE FREDERICK, with Lords"
16419,As you like it,1,2.2.1,DUKE FREDERICK,Can it be possible that no man saw them?
16420,As you like it,1,2.2.2,DUKE FREDERICK,It cannot be: some villains of my court
16421,As you like it,1,2.2.3,DUKE FREDERICK,Are of consent and sufferance in this.
16422,As you like it,2,2.2.4,First Lord,I cannot hear of any that did see her.
16423,As you like it,2,2.2.5,First Lord,"The ladies, her attendants of her chamber,"
16424,As you like it,2,2.2.6,First Lord,"Saw her abed, and in the morning early"
16425,As you like it,2,2.2.7,First Lord,They found the bed untreasured of their mistress.
16426,As you like it,3,2.2.8,Second Lord,"My lord, the roynish clown, at whom so oft"
16427,As you like it,3,2.2.9,Second Lord,"Your grace was wont to laugh, is also missing."
16428,As you like it,3,2.2.10,Second Lord,"Hisperia, the princess' gentlewoman,"
16429,As you like it,3,2.2.11,Second Lord,Confesses that she secretly o'erheard
16430,As you like it,3,2.2.12,Second Lord,Your daughter and her cousin much commend
16431,As you like it,3,2.2.13,Second Lord,The parts and graces of the wrestler
16432,As you like it,3,2.2.14,Second Lord,"That did but lately foil the sinewy Charles,"
16433,As you like it,3,2.2.15,Second Lord,"And she believes, wherever they are gone,"
16434,As you like it,3,2.2.16,Second Lord,That youth is surely in their company.
16435,As you like it,4,2.2.17,DUKE FREDERICK,"Send to his brother, fetch that gallant hither,"
16436,As you like it,4,2.2.18,DUKE FREDERICK,"If he be absent, bring his brother to me,"
16437,As you like it,4,2.2.19,DUKE FREDERICK,"I'll make him find him: do this suddenly,"
16438,As you like it,4,2.2.20,DUKE FREDERICK,And let not search and inquisition quail
16439,As you like it,4,2.2.21,DUKE FREDERICK,To bring again these foolish runaways.
16440,As you like it,4,,DUKE FREDERICK,Exeunt

16442,As you like it,4,,DUKE FREDERICK,"Enter ORLANDO and ADAM, meeting"
16443,As you like it,1,2.3.1,ORLANDO,Who's there?
16444,As you like it,2,2.3.2,ADAM,"What, my young master? O, my gentle master!"
16445,As you like it,2,2.3.3,ADAM,O my sweet master! O you memory
16446,As you like it,2,2.3.4,ADAM,"Of old Sir Rowland! why, what make you here?"
16447,As you like it,2,2.3.5,ADAM,Why are you virtuous? why do people love you?
16448,As you like it,2,2.3.6,ADAM,"And wherefore are you gentle, strong and valiant?"
16449,As you like it,2,2.3.7,ADAM,Why would you be so fond to overcome
16450,As you like it,2,2.3.8,ADAM,The bonny priser of the humorous duke?
16451,As you like it,2,2.3.9,ADAM,Your praise is come too swiftly home before you.
16452,As you like it,2,2.3.10,ADAM,"Know you not, master, to some kind of men"
16453,As you like it,2,2.3.11,ADAM,Their graces serve them but as enemies?
16454,As you like it,2,2.3.12,ADAM,"No more do yours: your virtues, gentle master,"
16455,As you like it,2,2.3.13,ADAM,Are sanctified and holy traitors to you.
16456,As you like it,2,2.3.14,ADAM,"O, what a world is this, when what is comely"
16457,As you like it,2,2.3.15,ADAM,Envenoms him that bears it!
16458,As you like it,3,2.3.16,ORLANDO,"Why, what's the matter?"
16459,As you like it,4,2.3.17,ADAM,O unhappy youth!
16460,As you like it,4,2.3.18,ADAM,"Come not within these doors, within this roof"
16461,As you like it,4,2.3.19,ADAM,The enemy of all your graces lives:
16462,As you like it,4,2.3.20,ADAM,"Your brother--no, no brother, yet the son--"
16463,As you like it,4,2.3.21,ADAM,"Yet not the son, I will not call him son"
16464,As you like it,4,2.3.22,ADAM,Of him I was about to call his father--
16465,As you like it,4,2.3.23,ADAM,"Hath heard your praises, and this night he means"
16466,As you like it,4,2.3.24,ADAM,To burn the lodging where you use to lie
16467,As you like it,4,2.3.25,ADAM,"And you within it: if he fail of that,"
16468,As you like it,4,2.3.26,ADAM,He will have other means to cut you off.
16469,As you like it,4,2.3.27,ADAM,I overheard him and his practises.
16470,As you like it,4,2.3.28,ADAM,"This is no place, this house is but a butchery:"
16471,As you like it,4,2.3.29,ADAM,"Abhor it, fear it, do not enter it."
16472,As you like it,5,2.3.30,ORLANDO,"Why, whither, Adam, wouldst thou have me go?"
16473,As you like it,6,2.3.31,ADAM,"No matter whither, so you come not here."
16474,As you like it,7,2.3.32,ORLANDO,"What, wouldst thou have me go and beg my food?"
16475,As you like it,7,2.3.33,ORLANDO,Or with a base and boisterous sword enforce
16476,As you like it,7,2.3.34,ORLANDO,A thievish living on the common road?
16477,As you like it,7,2.3.35,ORLANDO,"This I must do, or know not what to do:"
16478,As you like it,7,2.3.36,ORLANDO,"Yet this I will not do, do how I can,"
16479,As you like it,7,2.3.37,ORLANDO,I rather will subject me to the malice
16480,As you like it,7,2.3.38,ORLANDO,Of a diverted blood and bloody brother.
16481,As you like it,8,2.3.39,ADAM,"But do not so. I have five hundred crowns,"
16482,As you like it,8,2.3.40,ADAM,"The thrifty hire I saved under your father,"
16483,As you like it,8,2.3.41,ADAM,Which I did store to be my foster-nurse
16484,As you like it,8,2.3.42,ADAM,When service should in my old limbs lie lame
16485,As you like it,8,2.3.43,ADAM,And unregarded age in corners thrown:
16486,As you like it,8,2.3.44,ADAM,"Take that, and He that doth the ravens feed,"
16487,As you like it,8,2.3.45,ADAM,"Yea, providently caters for the sparrow,"
16488,As you like it,8,2.3.46,ADAM,"Be comfort to my age! Here is the gold,"
16489,As you like it,8,2.3.47,ADAM,And all this I give you. Let me be your servant:
16490,As you like it,8,2.3.48,ADAM,"Though I look old, yet I am strong and lusty,"
16491,As you like it,8,2.3.49,ADAM,For in my youth I never did apply
16492,As you like it,8,2.3.50,ADAM,"Hot and rebellious liquors in my blood,"
16493,As you like it,8,2.3.51,ADAM,Nor did not with unbashful forehead woo
16494,As you like it,8,2.3.52,ADAM,"The means of weakness and debility,"
16495,As you like it,8,2.3.53,ADAM,"Therefore my age is as a lusty winter,"
16496,As you like it,8,2.3.54,ADAM,"Frosty, but kindly: let me go with you,"
16497,As you like it,8,2.3.55,ADAM,I'll do the service of a younger man
16498,As you like it,8,2.3.56,ADAM,In all your business and necessities.
16499,As you like it,9,2.3.57,ORLANDO,"O good old man, how well in thee appears"
16500,As you like it,9,2.3.58,ORLANDO,"The constant service of the antique world,"
16501,As you like it,9,2.3.59,ORLANDO,"When service sweat for duty, not for meed!"
16502,As you like it,9,2.3.60,ORLANDO,"Thou art not for the fashion of these times,"
16503,As you like it,9,2.3.61,ORLANDO,"Where none will sweat but for promotion,"
16504,As you like it,9,2.3.62,ORLANDO,"And having that, do choke their service up"
16505,As you like it,9,2.3.63,ORLANDO,Even with the having: it is not so with thee.
16506,As you like it,9,2.3.64,ORLANDO,"But, poor old man, thou prunest a rotten tree,"
16507,As you like it,9,2.3.65,ORLANDO,That cannot so much as a blossom yield
16508,As you like it,9,2.3.66,ORLANDO,In lieu of all thy pains and husbandry
16509,As you like it,9,2.3.67,ORLANDO,"But come thy ways, well go along together,"
16510,As you like it,9,2.3.68,ORLANDO,"And ere we have thy youthful wages spent,"
16511,As you like it,9,2.3.69,ORLANDO,We'll light upon some settled low content.
16512,As you like it,10,2.3.70,ADAM,"Master, go on, and I will follow thee,"
16513,As you like it,10,2.3.71,ADAM,"To the last gasp, with truth and loyalty."
16514,As you like it,10,2.3.72,ADAM,From seventeen years till now almost fourscore
16515,As you like it,10,2.3.73,ADAM,"Here lived I, but now live here no more."
16516,As you like it,10,2.3.74,ADAM,"At seventeen years many their fortunes seek,"
16517,As you like it,10,2.3.75,ADAM,But at fourscore it is too late a week:
16518,As you like it,10,2.3.76,ADAM,Yet fortune cannot recompense me better
16519,As you like it,10,2.3.77,ADAM,Than to die well and not my master's debtor.
16520,As you like it,10,,ADAM,Exeunt
16521,As you like it,10,,ADAM,SCENE IV. The Forest of Arden.
16522,As you like it,10,,ADAM,"Enter ROSALIND for Ganymede, CELIA for Aliena, and TOUCHSTONE"
16523,As you like it,1,2.4.1,ROSALIND,"O Jupiter, how weary are my spirits!"
16524,As you like it,2,2.4.2,TOUCHSTONE,"I care not for my spirits, if my legs were not weary."
16525,As you like it,3,2.4.3,ROSALIND,I could find in my heart to disgrace my man's
16526,As you like it,3,2.4.4,ROSALIND,"apparel and to cry like a woman, but I must comfort"
16527,As you like it,3,2.4.5,ROSALIND,"the weaker vessel, as doublet and hose ought to show"
16528,As you like it,3,2.4.6,ROSALIND,"itself courageous to petticoat: therefore courage,"
16529,As you like it,3,2.4.7,ROSALIND,good Aliena!
16530,As you like it,4,2.4.8,CELIA,"I pray you, bear with me, I cannot go no further."
16531,As you like it,5,2.4.9,TOUCHSTONE,"For my part, I had rather bear with you than bear"
16532,As you like it,5,2.4.10,TOUCHSTONE,"you, yet I should bear no cross if I did bear you,"
16533,As you like it,5,2.4.11,TOUCHSTONE,for I think you have no money in your purse.
16534,As you like it,6,2.4.12,ROSALIND,"Well, this is the forest of Arden."
16535,As you like it,7,2.4.13,TOUCHSTONE,"Ay, now am I in Arden, the more fool I, when I was"
16536,As you like it,7,2.4.14,TOUCHSTONE,"at home, I was in a better place: but travellers"
16537,As you like it,7,2.4.15,TOUCHSTONE,must be content.
16538,As you like it,8,2.4.16,ROSALIND,"Ay, be so, good Touchstone."

16541,As you like it,8,2.4.18,ROSALIND,solemn talk.
16542,As you like it,9,2.4.19,CORIN,That is the way to make her scorn you still.
16543,As you like it,10,2.4.20,SILVIUS,"O Corin, that thou knew'st how I do love her!"

16611,As you like it,31,2.4.87,ROSALIND,What is he that shall buy his flock and pasture?

16959,As you like it,3,3.2.14,TOUCHSTONE,"it is naught. In respect that it is solitary, I"
16960,As you like it,3,3.2.15,TOUCHSTONE,"like it very well, but in respect that it is"
16961,As you like it,3,3.2.16,TOUCHSTONE,"private, it is a very vile life. Now, in respect it"
16962,As you like it,3,3.2.17,TOUCHSTONE,"is in the fields, it pleaseth me well, but in"
16963,As you like it,3,3.2.18,TOUCHSTONE,"respect it is not in the court, it is tedious. As"

16965,As you like it,3,3.2.20,TOUCHSTONE,"but as there is no more plenty in it, it goes much"
16966,As you like it,3,3.2.21,TOUCHSTONE,"against my stomach. Hast any philosophy in thee, shepherd?"
16967,As you like it,4,3.2.22,CORIN,No more but that I know the more one sickens the

16975,As you like it,5,3.2.30,TOUCHSTONE,Such a one is a natural philosopher. Wast ever in

17000,As you like it,16,3.2.55,CORIN,"Besides, our hands are hard."
17001,As you like it,17,3.2.56,TOUCHSTONE,Your lips will feel them the sooner. Shallow again.
17002,As you like it,17,3.2.57,TOUCHSTONE,"A more sounder instance, come."

17194,As you like it,79,3.2.245,ORLANDO,"And so had I, but yet, for fashion sake, I thank you"
17195,As you like it,79,3.2.246,ORLANDO,too for your society.
17196,As you like it,80,3.2.247,JAQUES,God be wi' you: let's meet as little as we can.
17197,As you like it,81,3.2.248,ORLANDO,I do desire we may be better strangers.
17198,As you like it,82,3.2.249,JAQUES,"I pray you, mar no more trees with writing"
17199,As you like it,82,3.2.250,JAQUES,love-songs in their barks.
17200,As you like it,83,3.2.251,ORLANDO,"I pray you, mar no more of my verses with reading"
17201,As you like it,83,3.2.252,ORLANDO,them ill-favouredly.
17202,As you like it,84,3.2.253,JAQUES,Rosalind is your love's name?
17203,As you like it,85,3.2.254,ORLANDO,"Yes, just."
17204,As you like it,86,3.2.255,JAQUES,I do not like her name.
17205,As you like it,87,3.2.256,ORLANDO,There was no thought of pleasing you when she was
17206,As you like it,87,3.2.257,ORLANDO,christened.
17207,As you like it,88,3.2.258,JAQUES,What stature is she of?
17208,As you like it,89,3.2.259,ORLANDO,Just as high as my heart.
17209,As you like it,90,3.2.260,JAQUES,You are full of pretty answers. Have you not been
17210,As you like it,90,3.2.261,JAQUES,"acquainted with goldsmiths' wives, and conned them"
17211,As you like it,90,3.2.262,JAQUES,out of rings?
17212,As you like it,91,3.2.263,ORLANDO,"Not so, but I answer you right painted cloth, from"
17213,As you like it,91,3.2.264,ORLANDO,whence you have studied your questions.
17214,As you like it,92,3.2.265,JAQUES,You have a nimble wit: I think 'twas made of
17215,As you like it,92,3.2.266,JAQUES,Atalanta's heels. Will you sit down with me? and
17216,As you like it,92,3.2.267,JAQUES,we two will rail against our mistress the world and
17217,As you like it,92,3.2.268,JAQUES,all our misery.
17218,As you like it,93,3.2.269,ORLANDO,"I will chide no breather in the world but myself,"
17219,As you like it,93,3.2.270,ORLANDO,against whom I know most faults.
17220,As you like it,94,3.2.271,JAQUES,The worst fault you have is to be in love.
17221,As you like it,95,3.2.272,ORLANDO,'Tis a fault I will not change for your best virtue.
17222,As you like it,95,3.2.273,ORLANDO,I am weary of you.

17226,As you like it,97,3.2.277,ORLANDO,shall see him.
17227,As you like it,98,3.2.278,JAQUES,There I shall see mine own figure.
17228,As you like it,99,3.2.279,ORLANDO,Which I take to be either a fool or a cipher.
17229,As you like it,100,3.2.280,JAQUES,"I'll tarry no longer with you: farewell, good"

17232,As you like it,101,3.2.283,ORLANDO,Melancholy.
17233,As you like it,101,,ORLANDO,Exit JAQUES
17234,As you like it,102,3.2.284,ROSALIND,"[Aside to CELIA]  I will speak to him, like a saucy"
17235,As you like it,102,3.2.285,ROSALIND,lackey and under that habit play the knave with him.
17236,As you like it,102,3.2.286,ROSALIND,"Do you hear, forester?"
17237,As you like it,103,3.2.287,ORLANDO,Very well: what would you?
17238,As you like it,104,3.2.288,ROSALIND,"I pray you, what is't o'clock?"
17239,As you like it,105,3.2.289,ORLANDO,You should ask me what time o' day: there's no clock
17240,As you like it,105,3.2.290,ORLANDO,in the forest.
17241,As you like it,106,3.2.291,ROSALIND,"Then there is no true lover in the forest, else"
17242,As you like it,106,3.2.292,ROSALIND,sighing every minute and groaning every hour would
17243,As you like it,106,3.2.293,ROSALIND,detect the lazy foot of Time as well as a clock.
17244,As you like it,107,3.2.294,ORLANDO,And why not the swift foot of Time? had not that
17245,As you like it,107,3.2.295,ORLANDO,been as proper?
17246,As you like it,108,3.2.296,ROSALIND,"By no means, sir: Time travels in divers paces with"
17247,As you like it,108,3.2.297,ROSALIND,divers persons. I'll tell you who Time ambles
17248,As you like it,108,3.2.298,ROSALIND,"withal, who Time trots withal, who Time gallops"
17249,As you like it,108,3.2.299,ROSALIND,withal and who he stands still withal.
17250,As you like it,109,3.2.300,ORLANDO,"I prithee, who doth he trot withal?"
17251,As you like it,110,3.2.301,ROSALIND,"Marry, he trots hard with a young maid between the"
17252,As you like it,110,3.2.302,ROSALIND,contract of her marriage and the day it is
17253,As you like it,110,3.2.303,ROSALIND,"solemnized: if the interim be but a se'nnight,"
17254,As you like it,110,3.2.304,ROSALIND,Time's pace is so hard that it seems the length of
17255,As you like it,110,3.2.305,ROSALIND,seven year.
17256,As you like it,111,3.2.306,ORLANDO,Who ambles Time withal?
17257,As you like it,112,3.2.307,ROSALIND,With a priest that lacks Latin and a rich man that
17258,As you like it,112,3.2.308,ROSALIND,"hath not the gout, for the one sleeps easily because"
17259,As you like it,112,3.2.309,ROSALIND,"he cannot study, and the other lives merrily because"
17260,As you like it,112,3.2.310,ROSALIND,"he feels no pain, the one lacking the burden of lean"
17261,As you like it,112,3.2.311,ROSALIND,"and wasteful learning, the other knowing no burden"
17262,As you like it,112,3.2.312,ROSALIND,"of heavy tedious penury, these Time ambles withal."
17263,As you like it,113,3.2.313,ORLANDO,Who doth he gallop withal?
17264,As you like it,114,3.2.314,ROSALIND,"With a thief to the gallows, for though he go as"
17265,As you like it,114,3.2.315,ROSALIND,"softly as foot can fall, he thinks himself too soon there."
17266,As you like it,115,3.2.316,ORLANDO,Who stays it still withal?
17267,As you like it,116,3.2.317,ROSALIND,"With lawyers in the vacation, for they sleep between"
17268,As you like it,116,3.2.318,ROSALIND,term and term and then they perceive not how Time moves.
17269,As you like it,117,3.2.319,ORLANDO,"Where dwell you, pretty youth?"
17270,As you like it,118,3.2.320,ROSALIND,"With this shepherdess, my sister, here in the"
17271,As you like it,118,3.2.321,ROSALIND,"skirts of the forest, like fringe upon a petticoat."
17272,As you like it,119,3.2.322,ORLANDO,Are you native of this place?
17273,As you like it,120,3.2.323,ROSALIND,As the cony that you see dwell where she is kindled.
17274,As you like it,121,3.2.324,ORLANDO,Your accent is something finer than you could
17275,As you like it,121,3.2.325,ORLANDO,purchase in so removed a dwelling.
17276,As you like it,122,3.2.326,ROSALIND,I have been told so of many: but indeed an old
17277,As you like it,122,3.2.327,ROSALIND,"religious uncle of mine taught me to speak, who was"
17278,As you like it,122,3.2.328,ROSALIND,"in his youth an inland man, one that knew courtship"
17279,As you like it,122,3.2.329,ROSALIND,"too well, for there he fell in love. I have heard"
17280,As you like it,122,3.2.330,ROSALIND,"him read many lectures against it, and I thank God"
17281,As you like it,122,3.2.331,ROSALIND,"I am not a woman, to be touched with so many"
17282,As you like it,122,3.2.332,ROSALIND,giddy offences as he hath generally taxed their
17283,As you like it,122,3.2.333,ROSALIND,whole sex withal.
17284,As you like it,123,3.2.334,ORLANDO,Can you remember any of the principal evils that he
17285,As you like it,123,3.2.335,ORLANDO,laid to the charge of women?
17286,As you like it,124,3.2.336,ROSALIND,"There were none principal, they were all like one"
17287,As you like it,124,3.2.337,ROSALIND,"another as half-pence are, every one fault seeming"
17288,As you like it,124,3.2.338,ROSALIND,monstrous till his fellow fault came to match it.
17289,As you like it,125,3.2.339,ORLANDO,"I prithee, recount some of them."
17290,As you like it,126,3.2.340,ROSALIND,"No, I will not cast away my physic but on those that"
17291,As you like it,126,3.2.341,ROSALIND,"are sick. There is a man haunts the forest, that"
17292,As you like it,126,3.2.342,ROSALIND,abuses our young plants with carving 'Rosalind' on
17293,As you like it,126,3.2.343,ROSALIND,"their barks, hangs odes upon hawthorns and elegies"
17294,As you like it,126,3.2.344,ROSALIND,"on brambles, all, forsooth, deifying the name of"
17295,As you like it,126,3.2.345,ROSALIND,Rosalind: if I could meet that fancy-monger I would
17296,As you like it,126,3.2.346,ROSALIND,"give him some good counsel, for he seems to have the"
17297,As you like it,126,3.2.347,ROSALIND,quotidian of love upon him.
17298,As you like it,127,3.2.348,ORLANDO,I am he that is so love-shaked: I pray you tell me
17299,As you like it,127,3.2.349,ORLANDO,your remedy.
17300,As you like it,128,3.2.350,ROSALIND,There is none of my uncle's marks upon you: he
17301,As you like it,128,3.2.351,ROSALIND,"taught me how to know a man in love, in which cage"
17302,As you like it,128,3.2.352,ROSALIND,of rushes I am sure you are not prisoner.
17303,As you like it,129,3.2.353,ORLANDO,What were his marks?
17304,As you like it,130,3.2.354,ROSALIND,"A lean cheek, which you have not, a blue eye and"
17305,As you like it,130,3.2.355,ROSALIND,"sunken, which you have not, an unquestionable"
17306,As you like it,130,3.2.356,ROSALIND,"spirit, which you have not, a beard neglected,"
17307,As you like it,130,3.2.357,ROSALIND,"which you have not, but I pardon you for that, for"
17308,As you like it,130,3.2.358,ROSALIND,simply your having in beard is a younger brother's
17309,As you like it,130,3.2.359,ROSALIND,"revenue: then your hose should be ungartered, your"
17310,As you like it,130,3.2.360,ROSALIND,"bonnet unbanded, your sleeve unbuttoned, your shoe"
17311,As you like it,130,3.2.361,ROSALIND,untied and every thing about you demonstrating a
17312,As you like it,130,3.2.362,ROSALIND,"careless desolation, but you are no such man, you"
17313,As you like it,130,3.2.363,ROSALIND,are rather point-device in your accoutrements as
17314,As you like it,130,3.2.364,ROSALIND,loving yourself than seeming the lover of any other.
17315,As you like it,131,3.2.365,ORLANDO,"Fair youth, I would I could make thee believe I love."
17316,As you like it,132,3.2.366,ROSALIND,Me believe it! you may as soon make her that you
17317,As you like it,132,3.2.367,ROSALIND,"love believe it, which, I warrant, she is apter to"
17318,As you like it,132,3.2.368,ROSALIND,do than to confess she does: that is one of the
17319,As you like it,132,3.2.369,ROSALIND,points in the which women still give the lie to
17320,As you like it,132,3.2.370,ROSALIND,"their consciences. But, in good sooth, are you he"
17321,As you like it,132,3.2.371,ROSALIND,"that hangs the verses on the trees, wherein Rosalind"
17322,As you like it,132,3.2.372,ROSALIND,is so admired?
17323,As you like it,133,3.2.373,ORLANDO,"I swear to thee, youth, by the white hand of"
17324,As you like it,133,3.2.374,ORLANDO,"Rosalind, I am that he, that unfortunate he."
17325,As you like it,134,3.2.375,ROSALIND,But are you so much in love as your rhymes speak?
17326,As you like it,135,3.2.376,ORLANDO,Neither rhyme nor reason can express how much.
17327,As you like it,136,3.2.377,ROSALIND,"Love is merely a madness, and, I tell you, deserves"
17328,As you like it,136,3.2.378,ROSALIND,as well a dark house and a whip as madmen do: and
17329,As you like it,136,3.2.379,ROSALIND,the reason why they are not so punished and cured
17330,As you like it,136,3.2.380,ROSALIND,"is, that the lunacy is so ordinary that the whippers"
17331,As you like it,136,3.2.381,ROSALIND,are in love too. Yet I profess curing it by counsel.
17332,As you like it,137,3.2.382,ORLANDO,Did you ever cure any so?
17333,As you like it,138,3.2.383,ROSALIND,"Yes, one, and in this manner. He was to imagine me"
17334,As you like it,138,3.2.384,ROSALIND,"his love, his mistress, and I set him every day to"
17335,As you like it,138,3.2.385,ROSALIND,"woo me: at which time would I, being but a moonish"
17336,As you like it,138,3.2.386,ROSALIND,"youth, grieve, be effeminate, changeable, longing"
17337,As you like it,138,3.2.387,ROSALIND,"and liking, proud, fantastical, apish, shallow,"
17338,As you like it,138,3.2.388,ROSALIND,"inconstant, full of tears, full of smiles, for every"
17339,As you like it,138,3.2.389,ROSALIND,passion something and for no passion truly any
17340,As you like it,138,3.2.390,ROSALIND,"thing, as boys and women are for the most part"
17341,As you like it,138,3.2.391,ROSALIND,"cattle of this colour, would now like him, now loathe"
17342,As you like it,138,3.2.392,ROSALIND,"him, then entertain him, then forswear him, now weep"
17343,As you like it,138,3.2.393,ROSALIND,"for him, then spit at him, that I drave my suitor"
17344,As you like it,138,3.2.394,ROSALIND,from his mad humour of love to a living humour of
17345,As you like it,138,3.2.395,ROSALIND,"madness, which was, to forswear the full stream of"
17346,As you like it,138,3.2.396,ROSALIND,"the world, and to live in a nook merely monastic."
17347,As you like it,138,3.2.397,ROSALIND,"And thus I cured him, and this way will I take upon"
17348,As you like it,138,3.2.398,ROSALIND,me to wash your liver as clean as a sound sheep's
17349,As you like it,138,3.2.399,ROSALIND,"heart, that there shall not be one spot of love in't."
17350,As you like it,139,3.2.400,ORLANDO,"I would not be cured, youth."
17351,As you like it,140,3.2.401,ROSALIND,"I would cure you, if you would but call me Rosalind"
17352,As you like it,140,3.2.402,ROSALIND,and come every day to my cote and woo me.
17353,As you like it,141,3.2.403,ORLANDO,"Now, by the faith of my love, I will: tell me"
17354,As you like it,141,3.2.404,ORLANDO,where it is.
17355,As you like it,142,3.2.405,ROSALIND,Go with me to it and I'll show it you and by the way
17356,As you like it,142,3.2.406,ROSALIND,you shall tell me where in the forest you live.
17357,As you like it,142,3.2.407,ROSALIND,Will you go?
17358,As you like it,143,3.2.408,ORLANDO,"With all my heart, good youth."
17359,As you like it,144,3.2.409,ROSALIND,"Nay you must call me Rosalind. Come, sister, will you go?"
17360,As you like it,144,,ROSALIND,Exeunt

17362,As you like it,144,,ROSALIND,"Enter TOUCHSTONE and AUDREY, JAQUES behind"
17363,As you like it,1,3.3.1,TOUCHSTONE,"Come apace, good Audrey: I will fetch up your"
17364,As you like it,1,3.3.2,TOUCHSTONE,"goats, Audrey. And how, Audrey? am I the man yet?"
17365,As you like it,1,3.3.3,TOUCHSTONE,doth my simple feature content you?
17366,As you like it,2,3.3.4,AUDREY,Your features! Lord warrant us! what features!
17367,As you like it,3,3.3.5,TOUCHSTONE,"I am here with thee and thy goats, as the most"
17368,As you like it,3,3.3.6,TOUCHSTONE,"capricious poet, honest Ovid, was among the Goths."
17369,As you like it,4,3.3.7,JAQUES,"[Aside]  O knowledge ill-inhabited, worse than Jove"
17370,As you like it,4,3.3.8,JAQUES,in a thatched house!
17371,As you like it,5,3.3.9,TOUCHSTONE,"When a man's verses cannot be understood, nor a"
17372,As you like it,5,3.3.10,TOUCHSTONE,man's good wit seconded with the forward child
17373,As you like it,5,3.3.11,TOUCHSTONE,"Understanding, it strikes a man more dead than a"
17374,As you like it,5,3.3.12,TOUCHSTONE,"great reckoning in a little room. Truly, I would"
17375,As you like it,5,3.3.13,TOUCHSTONE,the gods had made thee poetical.
17376,As you like it,6,3.3.14,AUDREY,I do not know what 'poetical' is: is it honest in
17377,As you like it,6,3.3.15,AUDREY,deed and word? is it a true thing?
17378,As you like it,7,3.3.16,TOUCHSTONE,"No, truly, for the truest poetry is the most"
17379,As you like it,7,3.3.17,TOUCHSTONE,"feigning, and lovers are given to poetry, and what"
17380,As you like it,7,3.3.18,TOUCHSTONE,they swear in poetry may be said as lovers they do feign.
17381,As you like it,8,3.3.19,AUDREY,Do you wish then that the gods had made me poetical?
17382,As you like it,9,3.3.20,TOUCHSTONE,"I do, truly, for thou swearest to me thou art"
17383,As you like it,9,3.3.21,TOUCHSTONE,"honest: now, if thou wert a poet, I might have some"
17384,As you like it,9,3.3.22,TOUCHSTONE,hope thou didst feign.
17385,As you like it,10,3.3.23,AUDREY,Would you not have me honest?
17386,As you like it,11,3.3.24,TOUCHSTONE,"No, truly, unless thou wert hard-favoured, for"
17387,As you like it,11,3.3.25,TOUCHSTONE,honesty coupled to beauty is to have honey a sauce to sugar.
17388,As you like it,12,3.3.26,JAQUES,[Aside]  A material fool!
17389,As you like it,13,3.3.27,AUDREY,"Well, I am not fair, and therefore I pray the gods"
17390,As you like it,13,3.3.28,AUDREY,make me honest.
17391,As you like it,14,3.3.29,TOUCHSTONE,"Truly, and to cast away honesty upon a foul slut"
17392,As you like it,14,3.3.30,TOUCHSTONE,were to put good meat into an unclean dish.
17393,As you like it,15,3.3.31,AUDREY,"I am not a slut, though I thank the gods I am foul."
17394,As you like it,16,3.3.32,TOUCHSTONE,"Well, praised be the gods for thy foulness!"
17395,As you like it,16,3.3.33,TOUCHSTONE,sluttishness may come hereafter. But be it as it may
17396,As you like it,16,3.3.34,TOUCHSTONE,"be, I will marry thee, and to that end I have been"
17397,As you like it,16,3.3.35,TOUCHSTONE,"with Sir Oliver Martext, the vicar of the next"
17398,As you like it,16,3.3.36,TOUCHSTONE,"village, who hath promised to meet me in this place"
17399,As you like it,16,3.3.37,TOUCHSTONE,of the forest and to couple us.
17400,As you like it,17,3.3.38,JAQUES,[Aside]  I would fain see this meeting.
17401,As you like it,18,3.3.39,AUDREY,"Well, the gods give us joy!"
17402,As you like it,19,3.3.40,TOUCHSTONE,"Amen. A man may, if he were of a fearful heart,"
17403,As you like it,19,3.3.41,TOUCHSTONE,"stagger in this attempt, for here we have no temple"
17404,As you like it,19,3.3.42,TOUCHSTONE,"but the wood, no assembly but horn-beasts. But what"
17405,As you like it,19,3.3.43,TOUCHSTONE,"though? C ourage! As horns are odious, they are"
17406,As you like it,19,3.3.44,TOUCHSTONE,"necessary. It is said, 'many a man knows no end of"
17407,As you like it,19,3.3.45,TOUCHSTONE,"his goods:' right, many a man has good horns, and"
17408,As you like it,19,3.3.46,TOUCHSTONE,"knows no end of them. Well, that is the dowry of"
17409,As you like it,19,3.3.47,TOUCHSTONE,"his wife, 'tis none of his own getting. Horns?"
17410,As you like it,19,3.3.48,TOUCHSTONE,"Even so. Poor men alone? No, no, the noblest deer"
17411,As you like it,19,3.3.49,TOUCHSTONE,hath them as huge as the rascal. Is the single man
17412,As you like it,19,3.3.50,TOUCHSTONE,therefore blessed? No: as a walled town is more
17413,As you like it,19,3.3.51,TOUCHSTONE,"worthier than a village, so is the forehead of a"
17414,As you like it,19,3.3.52,TOUCHSTONE,married man more honourable than the bare brow of a
17415,As you like it,19,3.3.53,TOUCHSTONE,"bachelor, and by how much defence is better than no"
17416,As you like it,19,3.3.54,TOUCHSTONE,"skill, by so much is a horn more precious than to"
17417,As you like it,19,3.3.55,TOUCHSTONE,want. Here comes Sir Oliver.
17418,As you like it,19,,TOUCHSTONE,Enter SIR OLIVER MARTEXT
17419,As you like it,19,3.3.56,TOUCHSTONE,"Sir Oliver Martext, you are well met: will you"
17420,As you like it,19,3.3.57,TOUCHSTONE,"dispatch us here under this tree, or shall we go"
17421,As you like it,19,3.3.58,TOUCHSTONE,with you to your chapel?
17422,As you like it,20,3.3.59,SIR OLIVER MARTEXT,Is there none here to give the woman?
17423,As you like it,21,3.3.60,TOUCHSTONE,I will not take her on gift of any man.
17424,As you like it,22,3.3.61,SIR OLIVER MARTEXT,"Truly, she must be given, or the marriage is not lawful."
17425,As you like it,23,3.3.62,JAQUES,[Advancing]
17426,As you like it,23,3.3.63,JAQUES,"Proceed, proceed	I'll give her."
17427,As you like it,24,3.3.64,TOUCHSTONE,"Good even, good Master What-ye-call't: how do you,"
17428,As you like it,24,3.3.65,TOUCHSTONE,sir? You are very well met: God 'ild you for your
17429,As you like it,24,3.3.66,TOUCHSTONE,last company: I am very glad to see you: even a
17430,As you like it,24,3.3.67,TOUCHSTONE,"toy in hand here, sir: nay, pray be covered."
17431,As you like it,25,3.3.68,JAQUES,"Will you be married, motley?"
17432,As you like it,26,3.3.69,TOUCHSTONE,"As the ox hath his bow, sir, the horse his curb and"
17433,As you like it,26,3.3.70,TOUCHSTONE,"the falcon her bells, so man hath his desires, and"
17434,As you like it,26,3.3.71,TOUCHSTONE,"as pigeons bill, so wedlock would be nibbling."
17435,As you like it,27,3.3.72,JAQUES,"And will you, being a man of your breeding, be"
17436,As you like it,27,3.3.73,JAQUES,married under a bush like a beggar? Get you to
17437,As you like it,27,3.3.74,JAQUES,"church, and have a good priest that can tell you"
17438,As you like it,27,3.3.75,JAQUES,what marriage is: this fellow will but join you
17439,As you like it,27,3.3.76,JAQUES,"together as they join wainscot, then one of you will"
17440,As you like it,27,3.3.77,JAQUES,"prove a shrunk panel and, like green timber, warp, warp."
17441,As you like it,28,3.3.78,TOUCHSTONE,[Aside]  I am not in the mind but I were better to be
17442,As you like it,28,3.3.79,TOUCHSTONE,married of him than of another: for he is not like
17443,As you like it,28,3.3.80,TOUCHSTONE,"to marry me well, and not being well married, it"
17444,As you like it,28,3.3.81,TOUCHSTONE,will be a good excuse for me hereafter to leave my wife.
17445,As you like it,29,3.3.82,JAQUES,"Go thou with me, and let me counsel thee."
17446,As you like it,30,3.3.83,TOUCHSTONE,"'Come, sweet Audrey:"
17447,As you like it,30,3.3.84,TOUCHSTONE,"We must be married, or we must live in bawdry."
17448,As you like it,30,3.3.85,TOUCHSTONE,"Farewell, good Master Oliver: not,--"
17449,As you like it,30,3.3.86,TOUCHSTONE,"O sweet Oliver,"
17450,As you like it,30,3.3.87,TOUCHSTONE,"O brave Oliver,"
17451,As you like it,30,3.3.88,TOUCHSTONE,"Leave me not behind thee: but,--"
17452,As you like it,30,3.3.89,TOUCHSTONE,"Wind away,"
17453,As you like it,30,3.3.90,TOUCHSTONE,"Begone, I say,"
17454,As you like it,30,3.3.91,TOUCHSTONE,I will not to wedding with thee.
17455,As you like it,30,,TOUCHSTONE,"Exeunt JAQUES, TOUCHSTONE and AUDREY"
17456,As you like it,31,3.3.92,SIR OLIVER MARTEXT,'Tis no matter: ne'er a fantastical knave of them
17457,As you like it,31,3.3.93,SIR OLIVER MARTEXT,all shall flout me out of my calling.
17458,As you like it,31,,SIR OLIVER MARTEXT,Exit
17459,As you like it,31,,SIR OLIVER MARTEXT,SCENE IV. The forest.
17460,As you like it,31,,SIR OLIVER MARTEXT,Enter ROSALIND and CELIA
17461,As you like it,1,3.4.1,ROSALIND,"Never talk to me, I will weep."
17462,As you like it,2,3.4.2,CELIA,"Do, I prithee, but yet have the grace to consider"
17463,As you like it,2,3.4.3,CELIA,that tears do not become a man.
17464,As you like it,3,3.4.4,ROSALIND,But have I not cause to weep?
17465,As you like it,4,3.4.5,CELIA,"As good cause as one would desire, therefore weep."
17466,As you like it,5,3.4.6,ROSALIND,His very hair is of the dissembling colour.
17467,As you like it,6,3.4.7,CELIA,"Something browner than Judas's marry, his kisses are"
17468,As you like it,6,3.4.8,CELIA,Judas's own children.
17469,As you like it,7,3.4.9,ROSALIND,"I' faith, his hair is of a good colour."
17470,As you like it,8,3.4.10,CELIA,An excellent colour: your chestnut was ever the only colour.
17471,As you like it,9,3.4.11,ROSALIND,And his kissing is as full of sanctity as the touch
17472,As you like it,9,3.4.12,ROSALIND,of holy bread.
17473,As you like it,10,3.4.13,CELIA,He hath bought a pair of cast lips of Diana: a nun
17474,As you like it,10,3.4.14,CELIA,"of winter's sisterhood kisses not more religiously,"
17475,As you like it,10,3.4.15,CELIA,the very ice of chastity is in them.
17476,As you like it,11,3.4.16,ROSALIND,"But why did he swear he would come this morning, and"
17477,As you like it,11,3.4.17,ROSALIND,comes not?
17478,As you like it,12,3.4.18,CELIA,"Nay, certainly, there is no truth in him."
17479,As you like it,13,3.4.19,ROSALIND,Do you think so?
17480,As you like it,14,3.4.20,CELIA,"Yes, I think he is not a pick-purse nor a"
17481,As you like it,14,3.4.21,CELIA,"horse-stealer, but for his verity in love, I do"
17482,As you like it,14,3.4.22,CELIA,think him as concave as a covered goblet or a
17483,As you like it,14,3.4.23,CELIA,worm-eaten nut.
17484,As you like it,15,3.4.24,ROSALIND,Not true in love?
17485,As you like it,16,3.4.25,CELIA,"Yes, when he is in, but I think he is not in."
17486,As you like it,17,3.4.26,ROSALIND,You have heard him swear downright he was.
17487,As you like it,18,3.4.27,CELIA,"'Was' is not 'is:' besides, the oath of a lover is"
17488,As you like it,18,3.4.28,CELIA,"no stronger than the word of a tapster, they are"
17489,As you like it,18,3.4.29,CELIA,both the confirmer of false reckonings. He attends
17490,As you like it,18,3.4.30,CELIA,here in the forest on the duke your father.
17491,As you like it,19,3.4.31,ROSALIND,I met the duke yesterday and had much question with
17492,As you like it,19,3.4.32,ROSALIND,"him: he asked me of what parentage I was, I told"
17493,As you like it,19,3.4.33,ROSALIND,"him, of as good as he, so he laughed and let me go."
17494,As you like it,19,3.4.34,ROSALIND,"But what talk we of fathers, when there is such a"
17495,As you like it,19,3.4.35,ROSALIND,man as Orlando?
17496,As you like it,20,3.4.36,CELIA,"O, that's a brave man! he writes brave verses,"
17497,As you like it,20,3.4.37,CELIA,"speaks brave words, swears brave oaths and breaks"
17498,As you like it,20,3.4.38,CELIA,"them bravely, quite traverse, athwart the heart of"
17499,As you like it,20,3.4.39,CELIA,"his lover, as a puisny tilter, that spurs his horse"
17500,As you like it,20,3.4.40,CELIA,"but on one side, breaks his staff like a noble"
17501,As you like it,20,3.4.41,CELIA,goose: but all's brave that youth mounts and folly
17502,As you like it,20,3.4.42,CELIA,guides. Who comes here?
17503,As you like it,20,,CELIA,Enter CORIN
17504,As you like it,21,3.4.43,CORIN,"Mistress and master, you have oft inquired"
17505,As you like it,21,3.4.44,CORIN,"After the shepherd that complain'd of love,"
17506,As you like it,21,3.4.45,CORIN,"Who you saw sitting by me on the turf,"
17507,As you like it,21,3.4.46,CORIN,Praising the proud disdainful shepherdess
17508,As you like it,21,3.4.47,CORIN,That was his mistress.
17509,As you like it,22,3.4.48,CELIA,"Well, and what of him?"
17510,As you like it,23,3.4.49,CORIN,"If you will see a pageant truly play'd,"
17511,As you like it,23,3.4.50,CORIN,Between the pale complexion of true love
17512,As you like it,23,3.4.51,CORIN,"And the red glow of scorn and proud disdain,"
17513,As you like it,23,3.4.52,CORIN,"Go hence a little and I shall conduct you,"
17514,As you like it,23,3.4.53,CORIN,If you will mark it.
17515,As you like it,24,3.4.54,ROSALIND,"O, come, let us remove:"
17516,As you like it,24,3.4.55,ROSALIND,The sight of lovers feedeth those in love.
17517,As you like it,24,3.4.56,ROSALIND,"Bring us to this sight, and you shall say"
17518,As you like it,24,3.4.57,ROSALIND,I'll prove a busy actor in their play.
17519,As you like it,24,,ROSALIND,Exeunt
17520,As you like it,24,,ROSALIND,SCENE V. Another part of the forest.
17521,As you like it,24,,ROSALIND,Enter SILVIUS and PHEBE
17522,As you like it,1,3.5.1,SILVIUS,"Sweet Phebe, do not scorn me, do not, Phebe,"
17523,As you like it,1,3.5.2,SILVIUS,"Say that you love me not, but say not so"
17524,As you like it,1,3.5.3,SILVIUS,"In bitterness. The common executioner,"
17525,As you like it,1,3.5.4,SILVIUS,"Whose heart the accustom'd sight of death makes hard,"
17526,As you like it,1,3.5.5,SILVIUS,Falls not the axe upon the humbled neck
17527,As you like it,1,3.5.6,SILVIUS,But first begs pardon: will you sterner be
17528,As you like it,1,3.5.7,SILVIUS,Than he that dies and lives by bloody drops?
17529,As you like it,1,,SILVIUS,"Enter ROSALIND, CELIA, and CORIN, behind"
17530,As you like it,2,3.5.8,PHEBE,I would not be thy executioner:
17531,As you like it,2,3.5.9,PHEBE,"I fly thee, for I would not injure thee."
17532,As you like it,2,3.5.10,PHEBE,Thou tell'st me there is murder in mine eye:
17533,As you like it,2,3.5.11,PHEBE,"'Tis pretty, sure, and very probable,"
17534,As you like it,2,3.5.12,PHEBE,"That eyes, that are the frail'st and softest things,"
17535,As you like it,2,3.5.13,PHEBE,"Who shut their coward gates on atomies,"
17536,As you like it,2,3.5.14,PHEBE,"Should be call'd tyrants, butchers, murderers!"
17537,As you like it,2,3.5.15,PHEBE,"Now I do frown on thee with all my heart,"
17538,As you like it,2,3.5.16,PHEBE,"And if mine eyes can wound, now let them kill thee:"
17539,As you like it,2,3.5.17,PHEBE,"Now counterfeit to swoon, why now fall down,"
17540,As you like it,2,3.5.18,PHEBE,"Or if thou canst not, O, for shame, for shame,"
17541,As you like it,2,3.5.19,PHEBE,"Lie not, to say mine eyes are murderers!"
17542,As you like it,2,3.5.20,PHEBE,Now show the wound mine eye hath made in thee:
17543,As you like it,2,3.5.21,PHEBE,"Scratch thee but with a pin, and there remains"
17544,As you like it,2,3.5.22,PHEBE,"Some scar of it, lean but upon a rush,"
17545,As you like it,2,3.5.23,PHEBE,The cicatrice and capable impressure
17546,As you like it,2,3.5.24,PHEBE,"Thy palm some moment keeps, but now mine eyes,"
17547,As you like it,2,3.5.25,PHEBE,"Which I have darted at thee, hurt thee not,"
17548,As you like it,2,3.5.26,PHEBE,"Nor, I am sure, there is no force in eyes"
17549,As you like it,2,3.5.27,PHEBE,That can do hurt.
17550,As you like it,3,3.5.28,SILVIUS,"O dear Phebe,"
17551,As you like it,3,3.5.29,SILVIUS,"If ever,--as that ever may be near,--"
17552,As you like it,3,3.5.30,SILVIUS,"You meet in some fresh cheek the power of fancy,"
17553,As you like it,3,3.5.31,SILVIUS,Then shall you know the wounds invisible
17554,As you like it,3,3.5.32,SILVIUS,That love's keen arrows make.
17555,As you like it,4,3.5.33,PHEBE,But till that time
17556,As you like it,4,3.5.34,PHEBE,"Come not thou near me: and when that time comes,"
17557,As you like it,4,3.5.35,PHEBE,"Afflict me with thy mocks, pity me not,"
17558,As you like it,4,3.5.36,PHEBE,As till that time I shall not pity thee.
17559,As you like it,5,3.5.37,ROSALIND,"And why, I pray you? Who might be your mother,"
17560,As you like it,5,3.5.38,ROSALIND,"That you insult, exult, and all at once,"
17561,As you like it,5,3.5.39,ROSALIND,"Over the wretched? What though you have no beauty,--"
17562,As you like it,5,3.5.40,ROSALIND,"As, by my faith, I see no more in you"
17563,As you like it,5,3.5.41,ROSALIND,Than without candle may go dark to bed--
17564,As you like it,5,3.5.42,ROSALIND,Must you be therefore proud and pitiless?
17565,As you like it,5,3.5.43,ROSALIND,"Why, what means this? Why do you look on me?"
17566,As you like it,5,3.5.44,ROSALIND,I see no more in you than in the ordinary
17567,As you like it,5,3.5.45,ROSALIND,"Of nature's sale-work. 'Od's my little life,"
17568,As you like it,5,3.5.46,ROSALIND,I think she means to tangle my eyes too!
17569,As you like it,5,3.5.47,ROSALIND,"No, faith, proud mistress, hope not after it:"
17570,As you like it,5,3.5.48,ROSALIND,"'Tis not your inky brows, your black silk hair,"
17571,As you like it,5,3.5.49,ROSALIND,"Your bugle eyeballs, nor your cheek of cream,"
17572,As you like it,5,3.5.50,ROSALIND,That can entame my spirits to your worship.
17573,As you like it,5,3.5.51,ROSALIND,"You foolish shepherd, wherefore do you follow her,"
17574,As you like it,5,3.5.52,ROSALIND,Like foggy south puffing with wind and rain?
17575,As you like it,5,3.5.53,ROSALIND,You are a thousand times a properer man
17576,As you like it,5,3.5.54,ROSALIND,Than she a woman: 'tis such fools as you
17577,As you like it,5,3.5.55,ROSALIND,That makes the world full of ill-favour'd children:
17578,As you like it,5,3.5.56,ROSALIND,"'Tis not her glass, but you, that flatters her,"
17579,As you like it,5,3.5.57,ROSALIND,And out of you she sees herself more proper
17580,As you like it,5,3.5.58,ROSALIND,Than any of her lineaments can show her.
17581,As you like it,5,3.5.59,ROSALIND,"But, mistress, know yourself: down on your knees,"
17582,As you like it,5,3.5.60,ROSALIND,"And thank heaven, fasting, for a good man's love:"
17583,As you like it,5,3.5.61,ROSALIND,"For I must tell you friendly in your ear,"
17584,As you like it,5,3.5.62,ROSALIND,Sell when you can: you are not for all markets:
17585,As you like it,5,3.5.63,ROSALIND,"Cry the man mercy, love him, take his offer:"
17586,As you like it,5,3.5.64,ROSALIND,"Foul is most foul, being foul to be a scoffer."
17587,As you like it,5,3.5.65,ROSALIND,"So take her to thee, shepherd: fare you well."
17588,As you like it,6,3.5.66,PHEBE,"Sweet youth, I pray you, chide a year together:"
17589,As you like it,6,3.5.67,PHEBE,I had rather hear you chide than this man woo.
17590,As you like it,7,3.5.68,ROSALIND,He's fallen in love with your foulness and she'll
17591,As you like it,7,3.5.69,ROSALIND,"fall in love with my anger. If it be so, as fast as"
17592,As you like it,7,3.5.70,ROSALIND,"she answers thee with frowning looks, I'll sauce her"
17593,As you like it,7,3.5.71,ROSALIND,with bitter words. Why look you so upon me?
17594,As you like it,8,3.5.72,PHEBE,For no ill will I bear you.
17595,As you like it,9,3.5.73,ROSALIND,"I pray you, do not fall in love with me,"
17596,As you like it,9,3.5.74,ROSALIND,For I am falser than vows made in wine:
17597,As you like it,9,3.5.75,ROSALIND,"Besides, I like you not. If you will know my house,"
17598,As you like it,9,3.5.76,ROSALIND,'Tis at the tuft of olives here hard by.
17599,As you like it,9,3.5.77,ROSALIND,"Will you go, sister? Shepherd, ply her hard."
17600,As you like it,9,3.5.78,ROSALIND,"Come, sister. Shepherdess, look on him better,"
17601,As you like it,9,3.5.79,ROSALIND,"And be not proud: though all the world could see,"
17602,As you like it,9,3.5.80,ROSALIND,None could be so abused in sight as he.
17603,As you like it,9,3.5.81,ROSALIND,"Come, to our flock."
17604,As you like it,9,,ROSALIND,"Exeunt ROSALIND, CELIA and CORIN"
17605,As you like it,10,3.5.82,PHEBE,"Dead Shepherd, now I find thy saw of might,"
17606,As you like it,10,3.5.83,PHEBE,'Who ever loved that loved not at first sight?'
17607,As you like it,11,3.5.84,SILVIUS,"Sweet Phebe,--"
17608,As you like it,12,3.5.85,PHEBE,"Ha, what say'st thou, Silvius?"
17609,As you like it,13,3.5.86,SILVIUS,"Sweet Phebe, pity me."
17610,As you like it,14,3.5.87,PHEBE,"Why, I am sorry for thee, gentle Silvius."
17611,As you like it,15,3.5.88,SILVIUS,"Wherever sorrow is, relief would be:"
17612,As you like it,15,3.5.89,SILVIUS,"If you do sorrow at my grief in love,"
17613,As you like it,15,3.5.90,SILVIUS,By giving love your sorrow and my grief
17614,As you like it,15,3.5.91,SILVIUS,Were both extermined.
17615,As you like it,16,3.5.92,PHEBE,Thou hast my love: is not that neighbourly?
17616,As you like it,17,3.5.93,SILVIUS,I would have you.
17617,As you like it,18,3.5.94,PHEBE,"Why, that were covetousness."
17618,As you like it,18,3.5.95,PHEBE,"Silvius, the time was that I hated thee,"
17619,As you like it,18,3.5.96,PHEBE,"And yet it is not that I bear thee love,"
17620,As you like it,18,3.5.97,PHEBE,"But since that thou canst talk of love so well,"
17621,As you like it,18,3.5.98,PHEBE,"Thy company, which erst was irksome to me,"
17622,As you like it,18,3.5.99,PHEBE,"I will endure, and I'll employ thee too:"
17623,As you like it,18,3.5.100,PHEBE,But do not look for further recompense
17624,As you like it,18,3.5.101,PHEBE,Than thine own gladness that thou art employ'd.
17625,As you like it,19,3.5.102,SILVIUS,"So holy and so perfect is my love,"
17626,As you like it,19,3.5.103,SILVIUS,"And I in such a poverty of grace,"
17627,As you like it,19,3.5.104,SILVIUS,That I shall think it a most plenteous crop
17628,As you like it,19,3.5.105,SILVIUS,To glean the broken ears after the man
17629,As you like it,19,3.5.106,SILVIUS,That the main harvest reaps: loose now and then
17630,As you like it,19,3.5.107,SILVIUS,"A scatter'd smile, and that I'll live upon."
17631,As you like it,20,3.5.108,PHEBE,Know'st now the youth that spoke to me erewhile?
17632,As you like it,21,3.5.109,SILVIUS,"Not very well, but I have met him oft,"
17633,As you like it,21,3.5.110,SILVIUS,And he hath bought the cottage and the bounds
17634,As you like it,21,3.5.111,SILVIUS,That the old carlot once was master of.
17635,As you like it,22,3.5.112,PHEBE,"Think not I love him, though I ask for him:"
17636,As you like it,22,3.5.113,PHEBE,"'Tis but a peevish boy, yet he talks well,"
17637,As you like it,22,3.5.114,PHEBE,But what care I for words? yet words do well
17638,As you like it,22,3.5.115,PHEBE,When he that speaks them pleases those that hear.
17639,As you like it,22,3.5.116,PHEBE,It is a pretty youth: not very pretty:
17640,As you like it,22,3.5.117,PHEBE,"But, sure, he's proud, and yet his pride becomes him:"
17641,As you like it,22,3.5.118,PHEBE,He'll make a proper man: the best thing in him
17642,As you like it,22,3.5.119,PHEBE,"Is his complexion, and faster than his tongue"
17643,As you like it,22,3.5.120,PHEBE,Did make offence his eye did heal it up.
17644,As you like it,22,3.5.121,PHEBE,"He is not very tall, yet for his years he's tall:"
17645,As you like it,22,3.5.122,PHEBE,"His leg is but so so, and yet 'tis well:"
17646,As you like it,22,3.5.123,PHEBE,"There was a pretty redness in his lip,"
17647,As you like it,22,3.5.124,PHEBE,A little riper and more lusty red
17648,As you like it,22,3.5.125,PHEBE,"Than that mix'd in his cheek, 'twas just the difference"
17649,As you like it,22,3.5.126,PHEBE,Between the constant red and mingled damask.
17650,As you like it,22,3.5.127,PHEBE,"There be some women, Silvius, had they mark'd him"
17651,As you like it,22,3.5.128,PHEBE,"In parcels as I did, would have gone near"
17652,As you like it,22,3.5.129,PHEBE,"To fall in love with him, but, for my part,"
17653,As you like it,22,3.5.130,PHEBE,"I love him not nor hate him not, and yet"
17654,As you like it,22,3.5.131,PHEBE,I have more cause to hate him than to love him:
17655,As you like it,22,3.5.132,PHEBE,For what had he to do to chide at me?
17656,As you like it,22,3.5.133,PHEBE,He said mine eyes were black and my hair black:
17657,As you like it,22,3.5.134,PHEBE,"And, now I am remember'd, scorn'd at me:"
17658,As you like it,22,3.5.135,PHEBE,I marvel why I answer'd not again:
17659,As you like it,22,3.5.136,PHEBE,"But that's all one, omittance is no quittance."
17660,As you like it,22,3.5.137,PHEBE,"I'll write to him a very taunting letter,"
17661,As you like it,22,3.5.138,PHEBE,"And thou shalt bear it: wilt thou, Silvius?"
17662,As you like it,23,3.5.139,SILVIUS,"Phebe, with all my heart."
17663,As you like it,24,3.5.140,PHEBE,"I'll write it straight,"
17664,As you like it,24,3.5.141,PHEBE,The matter's in my head and in my heart:
17665,As you like it,24,3.5.142,PHEBE,I will be bitter with him and passing short.
17666,As you like it,24,3.5.143,PHEBE,"Go with me, Silvius."
17667,As you like it,24,,PHEBE,Exeunt
17668,As you like it,24,,PHEBE,ACT IV
17669,As you like it,24,,PHEBE,SCENE I. The forest.
17670,As you like it,24,,PHEBE,"Enter ROSALIND, CELIA, and JAQUES"
17671,As you like it,1,4.1.1,JAQUES,"I prithee, pretty youth, let me be better acquainted"
17672,As you like it,1,4.1.2,JAQUES,with thee.
17673,As you like it,2,4.1.3,ROSALIND,They say you are a melancholy fellow.
17674,As you like it,3,4.1.4,JAQUES,"I am so, I do love it better than laughing."
17675,As you like it,4,4.1.5,ROSALIND,Those that are in extremity of either are abominable
17676,As you like it,4,4.1.6,ROSALIND,fellows and betray themselves to every modern
17677,As you like it,4,4.1.7,ROSALIND,censure worse than drunkards.
17678,As you like it,5,4.1.8,JAQUES,"Why, 'tis good to be sad and say nothing."
17679,As you like it,6,4.1.9,ROSALIND,"Why then, 'tis good to be a post."
17680,As you like it,7,4.1.10,JAQUES,"I have neither the scholar's melancholy, which is"
17681,As you like it,7,4.1.11,JAQUES,"emulation, nor the musician's, which is fantastical,"
17682,As you like it,7,4.1.12,JAQUES,"nor the courtier's, which is proud, nor the"
17683,As you like it,7,4.1.13,JAQUES,"soldier's, which is ambitious, nor the lawyer's,"
17684,As you like it,7,4.1.14,JAQUES,"which is politic, nor the lady's, which is nice, nor"
17685,As you like it,7,4.1.15,JAQUES,"the lover's, which is all these: but it is a"
17686,As you like it,7,4.1.16,JAQUES,"melancholy of mine own, compounded of many simples,"
17687,As you like it,7,4.1.17,JAQUES,"extracted from many objects, and indeed the sundry's"
17688,As you like it,7,4.1.18,JAQUES,"contemplation of my travels, in which my often"
17689,As you like it,7,4.1.19,JAQUES,rumination wraps me m a most humorous sadness.
17690,As you like it,8,4.1.20,ROSALIND,"A traveller! By my faith, you have great reason to"
17691,As you like it,8,4.1.21,ROSALIND,be sad: I fear you have sold your own lands to see
17692,As you like it,8,4.1.22,ROSALIND,"other men's, then, to have seen much and to have"
17693,As you like it,8,4.1.23,ROSALIND,"nothing, is to have rich eyes and poor hands."
17694,As you like it,9,4.1.24,JAQUES,"Yes, I have gained my experience."
17695,As you like it,10,4.1.25,ROSALIND,And your experience makes you sad: I had rather have
17696,As you like it,10,4.1.26,ROSALIND,a fool to make me merry than experience to make me
17697,As you like it,10,4.1.27,ROSALIND,"sad, and to travel for it too!"
17698,As you like it,10,,ROSALIND,Enter ORLANDO
17699,As you like it,11,4.1.28,ORLANDO,"Good day and happiness, dear Rosalind!"
17700,As you like it,12,4.1.29,JAQUES,"Nay, then, God be wi' you, an you talk in blank verse."
17701,As you like it,12,,JAQUES,Exit
17702,As you like it,13,4.1.30,ROSALIND,"Farewell, Monsieur Traveller: look you lisp and"
17703,As you like it,13,4.1.31,ROSALIND,"wear strange suits, disable all the benefits of your"
17704,As you like it,13,4.1.32,ROSALIND,"own country, be out of love with your nativity and"
17705,As you like it,13,4.1.33,ROSALIND,almost chide God for making you that countenance you
17706,As you like it,13,4.1.34,ROSALIND,"are, or I will scarce think you have swam in a"
17707,As you like it,13,4.1.35,ROSALIND,"gondola. Why, how now, Orlando! where have you been"
17708,As you like it,13,4.1.36,ROSALIND,all this while? You a lover! An you serve me such
17709,As you like it,13,4.1.37,ROSALIND,"another trick, never come in my sight more."
17710,As you like it,14,4.1.38,ORLANDO,"My fair Rosalind, I come within an hour of my promise."
17711,As you like it,15,4.1.39,ROSALIND,Break an hour's promise in love! He that will
17712,As you like it,15,4.1.40,ROSALIND,divide a minute into a thousand parts and break but
17713,As you like it,15,4.1.41,ROSALIND,a part of the thousandth part of a minute in the
17714,As you like it,15,4.1.42,ROSALIND,"affairs of love, it may be said of him that Cupid"
17715,As you like it,15,4.1.43,ROSALIND,"hath clapped him o' the shoulder, but I'll warrant"
17716,As you like it,15,4.1.44,ROSALIND,him heart-whole.
17717,As you like it,16,4.1.45,ORLANDO,"Pardon me, dear Rosalind."
17718,As you like it,17,4.1.46,ROSALIND,"Nay, an you be so tardy, come no more in my sight: I"
17719,As you like it,17,4.1.47,ROSALIND,had as lief be wooed of a snail.
17720,As you like it,18,4.1.48,ORLANDO,Of a snail?
17721,As you like it,19,4.1.49,ROSALIND,"Ay, of a snail, for though he comes slowly, he"
17722,As you like it,19,4.1.50,ROSALIND,"carries his house on his head, a better jointure,"
17723,As you like it,19,4.1.51,ROSALIND,"I think, than you make a woman: besides he brings"
17724,As you like it,19,4.1.52,ROSALIND,his destiny with him.
17725,As you like it,20,4.1.53,ORLANDO,What's that?
17726,As you like it,21,4.1.54,ROSALIND,"Why, horns, which such as you are fain to be"
17727,As you like it,21,4.1.55,ROSALIND,beholding to your wives for: but he comes armed in
17728,As you like it,21,4.1.56,ROSALIND,his fortune and prevents the slander of his wife.
17729,As you like it,22,4.1.57,ORLANDO,"Virtue is no horn-maker, and my Rosalind is virtuous."
17730,As you like it,23,4.1.58,ROSALIND,And I am your Rosalind.
17731,As you like it,24,4.1.59,CELIA,"It pleases him to call you so, but he hath a"
17732,As you like it,24,4.1.60,CELIA,Rosalind of a better leer than you.
17733,As you like it,25,4.1.61,ROSALIND,"Come, woo me, woo me, for now I am in a holiday"
17734,As you like it,25,4.1.62,ROSALIND,humour and like enough to consent. What would you
17735,As you like it,25,4.1.63,ROSALIND,"say to me now, an I were your very very Rosalind?"
17736,As you like it,26,4.1.64,ORLANDO,I would kiss before I spoke.
17737,As you like it,27,4.1.65,ROSALIND,"Nay, you were better speak first, and when you were"
17738,As you like it,27,4.1.66,ROSALIND,"gravelled for lack of matter, you might take"
17739,As you like it,27,4.1.67,ROSALIND,"occasion to kiss. Very good orators, when they are"
17740,As you like it,27,4.1.68,ROSALIND,"out, they will spit, and for lovers lacking--God"
17741,As you like it,27,4.1.69,ROSALIND,"warn us!--matter, the cleanliest shift is to kiss."
17742,As you like it,28,4.1.70,ORLANDO,How if the kiss be denied?
17743,As you like it,29,4.1.71,ROSALIND,"Then she puts you to entreaty, and there begins new matter."
17744,As you like it,30,4.1.72,ORLANDO,"Who could be out, being before his beloved mistress?"
17745,As you like it,31,4.1.73,ROSALIND,"Marry, that should you, if I were your mistress, or"
17746,As you like it,31,4.1.74,ROSALIND,I should think my honesty ranker than my wit.
17747,As you like it,32,4.1.75,ORLANDO,"What, of my suit?"
17748,As you like it,33,4.1.76,ROSALIND,"Not out of your apparel, and yet out of your suit."
17749,As you like it,33,4.1.77,ROSALIND,Am not I your Rosalind?
17750,As you like it,34,4.1.78,ORLANDO,"I take some joy to say you are, because I would be"
17751,As you like it,34,4.1.79,ORLANDO,talking of her.
17752,As you like it,35,4.1.80,ROSALIND,Well in her person I say I will not have you.
17753,As you like it,36,4.1.81,ORLANDO,Then in mine own person I die.
17754,As you like it,37,4.1.82,ROSALIND,"No, faith, die by attorney. The poor world is"
17755,As you like it,37,4.1.83,ROSALIND,"almost six thousand years old, and in all this time"
17756,As you like it,37,4.1.84,ROSALIND,"there was not any man died in his own person,"
17757,As you like it,37,4.1.85,ROSALIND,"videlicit, in a love-cause. Troilus had his brains"
17758,As you like it,37,4.1.86,ROSALIND,"dashed out with a Grecian club, yet he did what he"
17759,As you like it,37,4.1.87,ROSALIND,"could to die before, and he is one of the patterns"
17760,As you like it,37,4.1.88,ROSALIND,"of love. Leander, he would have lived many a fair"
17761,As you like it,37,4.1.89,ROSALIND,"year, though Hero had turned nun, if it had not been"
17762,As you like it,37,4.1.90,ROSALIND,"for a hot midsummer night, for, good youth, he went"
17763,As you like it,37,4.1.91,ROSALIND,but forth to wash him in the Hellespont and being
17764,As you like it,37,4.1.92,ROSALIND,taken with the cramp was drowned and the foolish
17765,As you like it,37,4.1.93,ROSALIND,coroners of that age found it was 'Hero of Sestos.'
17766,As you like it,37,4.1.94,ROSALIND,But these are all lies: men have died from time to
17767,As you like it,37,4.1.95,ROSALIND,"time and worms have eaten them, but not for love."
17768,As you like it,38,4.1.96,ORLANDO,"I would not have my right Rosalind of this mind,"
17769,As you like it,38,4.1.97,ORLANDO,"for, I protest, her frown might kill me."
17770,As you like it,39,4.1.98,ROSALIND,"By this hand, it will not kill a fly. But come, now"
17771,As you like it,39,4.1.99,ROSALIND,I will be your Rosalind in a more coming-on
17772,As you like it,39,4.1.100,ROSALIND,"disposition, and ask me what you will. I will grant"
17773,As you like it,39,4.1.101,ROSALIND,it.
17774,As you like it,40,4.1.102,ORLANDO,"Then love me, Rosalind."
17775,As you like it,41,4.1.103,ROSALIND,"Yes, faith, will I, Fridays and Saturdays and all."
17776,As you like it,42,4.1.104,ORLANDO,And wilt thou have me?
17777,As you like it,43,4.1.105,ROSALIND,"Ay, and twenty such."
17778,As you like it,44,4.1.106,ORLANDO,What sayest thou?
17779,As you like it,45,4.1.107,ROSALIND,Are you not good?
17780,As you like it,46,4.1.108,ORLANDO,I hope so.
17781,As you like it,47,4.1.109,ROSALIND,"Why then, can one desire too much of a good thing?"
17782,As you like it,47,4.1.110,ROSALIND,"Come, sister, you shall be the priest and marry us."
17783,As you like it,47,4.1.111,ROSALIND,"Give me your hand, Orlando. What do you say, sister?"
17784,As you like it,48,4.1.112,ORLANDO,"Pray thee, marry us."
17785,As you like it,49,4.1.113,CELIA,I cannot say the words.
17786,As you like it,50,4.1.114,ROSALIND,"You must begin, 'Will you, Orlando--'"
17787,As you like it,51,4.1.115,CELIA,"Go to. Will you, Orlando, have to wife this Rosalind?"
17788,As you like it,52,4.1.116,ORLANDO,I will.
17789,As you like it,53,4.1.117,ROSALIND,"Ay, but when?"
17790,As you like it,54,4.1.118,ORLANDO,"Why now, as fast as she can marry us."
17791,As you like it,55,4.1.119,ROSALIND,"Then you must say 'I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.'"
17792,As you like it,56,4.1.120,ORLANDO,"I take thee, Rosalind, for wife."
17793,As you like it,57,4.1.121,ROSALIND,"I might ask you for your commission, but I do take"
17794,As you like it,57,4.1.122,ROSALIND,"thee, Orlando, for my husband: there's a girl goes"
17795,As you like it,57,4.1.123,ROSALIND,"before the priest, and certainly a woman's thought"
17796,As you like it,57,4.1.124,ROSALIND,runs before her actions.
17797,As you like it,58,4.1.125,ORLANDO,"So do all thoughts, they are winged."
17798,As you like it,59,4.1.126,ROSALIND,Now tell me how long you would have her after you
17799,As you like it,59,4.1.127,ROSALIND,have possessed her.
17800,As you like it,60,4.1.128,ORLANDO,For ever and a day.
17801,As you like it,61,4.1.129,ROSALIND,"Say 'a day,' without the 'ever.' No, no, Orlando,"
17802,As you like it,61,4.1.130,ROSALIND,"men are April when they woo, December when they wed:"
17803,As you like it,61,4.1.131,ROSALIND,"maids are May when they are maids, but the sky"
17804,As you like it,61,4.1.132,ROSALIND,changes when they are wives. I will be more jealous
17805,As you like it,61,4.1.133,ROSALIND,"of thee than a Barbary cock-pigeon over his hen,"
17806,As you like it,61,4.1.134,ROSALIND,"more clamorous than a parrot against rain, more"
17807,As you like it,61,4.1.135,ROSALIND,"new-fangled than an ape, more giddy in my desires"
17808,As you like it,61,4.1.136,ROSALIND,"than a monkey: I will weep for nothing, like Diana"
17809,As you like it,61,4.1.137,ROSALIND,"in the fountain, and I will do that when you are"
17810,As you like it,61,4.1.138,ROSALIND,"disposed to be merry, I will laugh like a hyen, and"
17811,As you like it,61,4.1.139,ROSALIND,that when thou art inclined to sleep.
17812,As you like it,62,4.1.140,ORLANDO,But will my Rosalind do so?
17813,As you like it,63,4.1.141,ROSALIND,"By my life, she will do as I do."
17814,As you like it,64,4.1.142,ORLANDO,"O, but she is wise."
17815,As you like it,65,4.1.143,ROSALIND,Or else she could not have the wit to do this: the
17816,As you like it,65,4.1.144,ROSALIND,"wiser, the waywarder: make the doors upon a woman's"

17835,As you like it,73,4.1.163,ROSALIND,"Ay, go your ways, go your ways, I knew what you"
17836,As you like it,73,4.1.164,ROSALIND,"would prove: my friends told me as much, and I"
17837,As you like it,73,4.1.165,ROSALIND,thought no less: that flattering tongue of yours
17838,As you like it,73,4.1.166,ROSALIND,"won me: 'tis but one cast away, and so, come,"
17839,As you like it,73,4.1.167,ROSALIND,death! Two o'clock is your hour?

17848,As you like it,75,4.1.176,ROSALIND,unfaithful: therefore beware my censure and keep
17849,As you like it,75,4.1.177,ROSALIND,your promise.
17850,As you like it,76,4.1.178,ORLANDO,With no less religion than if thou wert indeed my

17855,As you like it,78,4.1.182,CELIA,You have simply misused our sex in your love-prate:
17856,As you like it,78,4.1.183,CELIA,we must have your doublet and hose plucked over your
17857,As you like it,78,4.1.184,CELIA,"head, and show the world what the bird hath done to"
17858,As you like it,78,4.1.185,CELIA,her own nest.
17859,As you like it,79,4.1.186,ROSALIND,"O coz, coz, coz, my pretty little coz, that thou"
17860,As you like it,79,4.1.187,ROSALIND,didst know how many fathom deep I am in love! But
17861,As you like it,79,4.1.188,ROSALIND,it cannot be sounded: my affection hath an unknown
17862,As you like it,79,4.1.189,ROSALIND,"bottom, like the bay of Portugal."
17863,As you like it,80,4.1.190,CELIA,"Or rather, bottomless, that as fast as you pour"

17871,As you like it,81,4.1.198,ROSALIND,sigh till he come.
17872,As you like it,82,4.1.199,CELIA,And I'll sleep.

17878,As you like it,3,4.2.3,JAQUES,"Let's present him to the duke, like a Roman"
17879,As you like it,3,4.2.4,JAQUES,"conqueror, and it would do well to set the deer's"
17880,As you like it,3,4.2.5,JAQUES,"horns upon his head, for a branch of victory. Have"
17881,As you like it,3,4.2.6,JAQUES,"you no song, forester, for this purpose?"
17882,As you like it,4,4.2.7,Forester,"Yes, sir."

17893,As you like it,6,4.2.17,Forester,And thy father bore it:
17894,As you like it,6,4.2.18,Forester,"The horn, the horn, the lusty horn"

17900,As you like it,1,4.3.2,ROSALIND,here much Orlando!
17901,As you like it,2,4.3.3,CELIA,"I warrant you, with pure love and troubled brain, he"

17905,As you like it,3,4.3.6,SILVIUS,"My errand is to you, fair youth,"
17906,As you like it,3,4.3.7,SILVIUS,My gentle Phebe bid me give you this:
17907,As you like it,3,4.3.8,SILVIUS,"I know not the contents, but, as I guess"
17908,As you like it,3,4.3.9,SILVIUS,By the stern brow and waspish action
17909,As you like it,3,4.3.10,SILVIUS,"Which she did use as she was writing of it,"
17910,As you like it,3,4.3.11,SILVIUS,It bears an angry tenor: pardon me:
17911,As you like it,3,4.3.12,SILVIUS,I am but as a guiltless messenger.
17912,As you like it,4,4.3.13,ROSALIND,Patience herself would startle at this letter
17913,As you like it,4,4.3.14,ROSALIND,"And play the swaggerer, bear this, bear all:"

17915,As you like it,4,4.3.16,ROSALIND,"She calls me proud, and that she could not love me,"
17916,As you like it,4,4.3.17,ROSALIND,Were man as rare as phoenix. 'Od's my will!
17917,As you like it,4,4.3.18,ROSALIND,Her love is not the hare that I do hunt:
17918,As you like it,4,4.3.19,ROSALIND,"Why writes she so to me? Well, shepherd, well,"
17919,As you like it,4,4.3.20,ROSALIND,This is a letter of your own device.
17920,As you like it,5,4.3.21,SILVIUS,"No, I protest, I know not the contents:"
17921,As you like it,5,4.3.22,SILVIUS,Phebe did write it.
17922,As you like it,6,4.3.23,ROSALIND,"Come, come, you are a fool"
17923,As you like it,6,4.3.24,ROSALIND,And turn'd into the extremity of love.
17924,As you like it,6,4.3.25,ROSALIND,I saw her hand: she has a leathern hand.
17925,As you like it,6,4.3.26,ROSALIND,"A freestone-colour'd hand, I verily did think"
17926,As you like it,6,4.3.27,ROSALIND,"That her old gloves were on, but 'twas her hands:"
17927,As you like it,6,4.3.28,ROSALIND,"She has a huswife's hand, but that's no matter:"
17928,As you like it,6,4.3.29,ROSALIND,"I say she never did invent this letter,"
17929,As you like it,6,4.3.30,ROSALIND,This is a man's invention and his hand.
17930,As you like it,7,4.3.31,SILVIUS,"Sure, it is hers."
17931,As you like it,8,4.3.32,ROSALIND,"Why, 'tis a boisterous and a cruel style."
17932,As you like it,8,4.3.33,ROSALIND,"A style for-challengers, why, she defies me,"
17933,As you like it,8,4.3.34,ROSALIND,Like Turk to Christian: women's gentle brain
17934,As you like it,8,4.3.35,ROSALIND,Could not drop forth such giant-rude invention
17935,As you like it,8,4.3.36,ROSALIND,"Such Ethiope words, blacker in their effect"
17936,As you like it,8,4.3.37,ROSALIND,Than in their countenance. Will you hear the letter?
17937,As you like it,9,4.3.38,SILVIUS,"So please you, for I never heard it yet,"
17938,As you like it,9,4.3.39,SILVIUS,Yet heard too much of Phebe's cruelty.
17939,As you like it,10,4.3.40,ROSALIND,She Phebes me: mark how the tyrant writes.
17940,As you like it,10,,ROSALIND,Reads

17942,As you like it,10,4.3.42,ROSALIND,That a maiden's heart hath burn'd?
17943,As you like it,10,4.3.43,ROSALIND,Can a woman rail thus?
17944,As you like it,11,4.3.44,SILVIUS,Call you this railing?
17945,As you like it,12,4.3.45,ROSALIND,[Reads]
17946,As you like it,12,4.3.46,ROSALIND,"Why, thy godhead laid apart,"

17948,As you like it,12,4.3.48,ROSALIND,Did you ever hear such railing?
17949,As you like it,12,4.3.49,ROSALIND,"Whiles the eye of man did woo me,"
17950,As you like it,12,4.3.50,ROSALIND,That could do no vengeance to me.
17951,As you like it,12,4.3.51,ROSALIND,Meaning me a beast.
17952,As you like it,12,4.3.52,ROSALIND,If the scorn of your bright eyne
17953,As you like it,12,4.3.53,ROSALIND,"Have power to raise such love in mine,"
17954,As you like it,12,4.3.54,ROSALIND,"Alack, in me what strange effect"
17955,As you like it,12,4.3.55,ROSALIND,Would they work in mild aspect!
17956,As you like it,12,4.3.56,ROSALIND,"Whiles you chid me, I did love,"
17957,As you like it,12,4.3.57,ROSALIND,How then might your prayers move!
17958,As you like it,12,4.3.58,ROSALIND,He that brings this love to thee
17959,As you like it,12,4.3.59,ROSALIND,Little knows this love in me:
17960,As you like it,12,4.3.60,ROSALIND,"And by him seal up thy mind,"
17961,As you like it,12,4.3.61,ROSALIND,Whether that thy youth and kind
17962,As you like it,12,4.3.62,ROSALIND,Will the faithful offer take
17963,As you like it,12,4.3.63,ROSALIND,"Of me and all that I can make,"
17964,As you like it,12,4.3.64,ROSALIND,"Or else by him my love deny,"
17965,As you like it,12,4.3.65,ROSALIND,And then I'll study how to die.
17966,As you like it,13,4.3.66,SILVIUS,Call you this chiding?
17967,As you like it,14,4.3.67,CELIA,"Alas, poor shepherd!"
17968,As you like it,15,4.3.68,ROSALIND,"Do you pity him? no, he deserves no pity. Wilt"
17969,As you like it,15,4.3.69,ROSALIND,"thou love such a woman? What, to make thee an"
17970,As you like it,15,4.3.70,ROSALIND,instrument and play false strains upon thee! not to
17971,As you like it,15,4.3.71,ROSALIND,"be endured! Well, go your way to her, for I see"
17972,As you like it,15,4.3.72,ROSALIND,"love hath made thee a tame snake, and say this to"
17973,As you like it,15,4.3.73,ROSALIND,"her: that if she love me, I charge her to love"
17974,As you like it,15,4.3.74,ROSALIND,"thee, if she will not, I will never have her unless"
17975,As you like it,15,4.3.75,ROSALIND,"thou entreat for her. If you be a true lover,"
17976,As you like it,15,4.3.76,ROSALIND,"hence, and not a word, for here comes more company."
17977,As you like it,15,,ROSALIND,Exit SILVIUS

17979,As you like it,16,4.3.77,OLIVER,"Good morrow, fair ones: pray you, if you know,"
17980,As you like it,16,4.3.78,OLIVER,Where in the purlieus of this forest stands
17981,As you like it,16,4.3.79,OLIVER,A sheep-cote fenced about with olive trees?
17982,As you like it,17,4.3.80,CELIA,"West of this place, down in the neighbour bottom:"
17983,As you like it,17,4.3.81,CELIA,The rank of osiers by the murmuring stream
17984,As you like it,17,4.3.82,CELIA,Left on your right hand brings you to the place.
17985,As you like it,17,4.3.83,CELIA,"But at this hour the house doth keep itself,"
17986,As you like it,17,4.3.84,CELIA,There's none within.
17987,As you like it,18,4.3.85,OLIVER,"If that an eye may profit by a tongue,"
17988,As you like it,18,4.3.86,OLIVER,"Then should I know you by description,"
17989,As you like it,18,4.3.87,OLIVER,"Such garments and such years: 'The boy is fair,"
17990,As you like it,18,4.3.88,OLIVER,"Of female favour, and bestows himself"
17991,As you like it,18,4.3.89,OLIVER,Like a ripe sister: the woman low
17992,As you like it,18,4.3.90,OLIVER,And browner than her brother.' Are not you
17993,As you like it,18,4.3.91,OLIVER,The owner of the house I did inquire for?
17994,As you like it,19,4.3.92,CELIA,"It is no boast, being ask'd, to say we are."
17995,As you like it,20,4.3.93,OLIVER,"Orlando doth commend him to you both,"
17996,As you like it,20,4.3.94,OLIVER,And to that youth he calls his Rosalind
17997,As you like it,20,4.3.95,OLIVER,He sends this bloody napkin. Are you he?
17998,As you like it,21,4.3.96,ROSALIND,I am: what must we understand by this?
17999,As you like it,22,4.3.97,OLIVER,"Some of my shame, if you will know of me"

18009,As you like it,24,4.3.107,OLIVER,"Under an oak, whose boughs were moss'd with age"
18010,As you like it,24,4.3.108,OLIVER,"And high top bald with dry antiquity,"
18011,As you like it,24,4.3.109,OLIVER,"A wretched ragged man, o'ergrown with hair,"
18012,As you like it,24,4.3.110,OLIVER,Lay sleeping on his back: about his neck
18013,As you like it,24,4.3.111,OLIVER,"A green and gilded snake had wreathed itself,"
18014,As you like it,24,4.3.112,OLIVER,Who with her head nimble in threats approach'd
18015,As you like it,24,4.3.113,OLIVER,"The opening of his mouth, but suddenly,"
18016,As you like it,24,4.3.114,OLIVER,"Seeing Orlando, it unlink'd itself,"
18017,As you like it,24,4.3.115,OLIVER,And with indented glides did slip away
18018,As you like it,24,4.3.116,OLIVER,Into a bush: under which bush's shade
18019,As you like it,24,4.3.117,OLIVER,"A lioness, with udders all drawn dry,"
18020,As you like it,24,4.3.118,OLIVER,"Lay couching, head on ground, with catlike watch,"

18027,As you like it,25,4.3.125,CELIA,And he did render him the most unnatural
18028,As you like it,25,4.3.126,CELIA,That lived amongst men.
18029,As you like it,26,4.3.127,OLIVER,"And well he might so do,"
18030,As you like it,26,4.3.128,OLIVER,For well I know he was unnatural.
18031,As you like it,27,4.3.129,ROSALIND,"But, to Orlando: did he leave him there,"
18032,As you like it,27,4.3.130,ROSALIND,Food to the suck'd and hungry lioness?
18033,As you like it,28,4.3.131,OLIVER,"Twice did he turn his back and purposed so,"
18034,As you like it,28,4.3.132,OLIVER,"But kindness, nobler ever than revenge,"
18035,As you like it,28,4.3.133,OLIVER,"And nature, stronger than his just occasion,"
18036,As you like it,28,4.3.134,OLIVER,"Made him give battle to the lioness,"
18037,As you like it,28,4.3.135,OLIVER,Who quickly fell before him: in which hurtling
18038,As you like it,28,4.3.136,OLIVER,From miserable slumber I awaked.
18039,As you like it,29,4.3.137,CELIA,Are you his brother?
18040,As you like it,30,4.3.138,ROSALIND,Wast you he rescued?
18041,As you like it,31,4.3.139,CELIA,Was't you that did so oft contrive to kill him?
18042,As you like it,32,4.3.140,OLIVER,"'Twas I, but 'tis not I	I do not shame"
18043,As you like it,32,4.3.141,OLIVER,"To tell you what I was, since my conversion"
18044,As you like it,32,4.3.142,OLIVER,"So sweetly tastes, being the thing I am."
18045,As you like it,33,4.3.143,ROSALIND,"But, for the bloody napkin?"
18046,As you like it,34,4.3.144,OLIVER,By and by.
18047,As you like it,34,4.3.145,OLIVER,When from the first to last betwixt us two

18049,As you like it,34,4.3.147,OLIVER,As how I came into that desert place:--
18050,As you like it,34,4.3.148,OLIVER,"In brief, he led me to the gentle duke,"
18051,As you like it,34,4.3.149,OLIVER,"Who gave me fresh array and entertainment,"
18052,As you like it,34,4.3.150,OLIVER,"Committing me unto my brother's love,"
18053,As you like it,34,4.3.151,OLIVER,"Who led me instantly unto his cave,"
18054,As you like it,34,4.3.152,OLIVER,"There stripp'd himself, and here upon his arm"
18055,As you like it,34,4.3.153,OLIVER,"The lioness had torn some flesh away,"
18056,As you like it,34,4.3.154,OLIVER,"Which all this while had bled, and now he fainted"
18057,As you like it,34,4.3.155,OLIVER,"And cried, in fainting, upon Rosalind."
18058,As you like it,34,4.3.156,OLIVER,"Brief, I recover'd him, bound up his wound,"
18059,As you like it,34,4.3.157,OLIVER,"And, after some small space, being strong at heart,"
18060,As you like it,34,4.3.158,OLIVER,"He sent me hither, stranger as I am,"
18061,As you like it,34,4.3.159,OLIVER,"To tell this story, that you might excuse"

18067,As you like it,36,4.3.164,OLIVER,Many will swoon when they do look on blood.
18068,As you like it,37,4.3.165,CELIA,There is more in it. Cousin Ganymede!
18069,As you like it,38,4.3.166,OLIVER,"Look, he recovers."
18070,As you like it,39,4.3.167,ROSALIND,I would I were at home.
18071,As you like it,40,4.3.168,CELIA,We'll lead you thither.

18074,As you like it,41,4.3.171,OLIVER,man's heart.
18075,As you like it,42,4.3.172,ROSALIND,"I do so, I confess it. Ah, sirrah, a body would"
18076,As you like it,42,4.3.173,ROSALIND,"think this was well counterfeited! I pray you, tell"
18077,As you like it,42,4.3.174,ROSALIND,your brother how well I counterfeited. Heigh-ho!
18078,As you like it,43,4.3.175,OLIVER,This was not counterfeit: there is too great
18079,As you like it,43,4.3.176,OLIVER,testimony in your complexion that it was a passion
18080,As you like it,43,4.3.177,OLIVER,of earnest.
18081,As you like it,44,4.3.178,ROSALIND,"Counterfeit, I assure you."
18082,As you like it,45,4.3.179,OLIVER,"Well then, take a good heart and counterfeit to be a man."
18083,As you like it,46,4.3.180,ROSALIND,"So I do: but, i' faith, I should have been a woman by right."
18084,As you like it,47,4.3.181,CELIA,"Come, you look paler and paler: pray you, draw"
18085,As you like it,47,4.3.182,CELIA,"homewards. Good sir, go with us."

18102,As you like it,5,5.1.9,TOUCHSTONE,It is meat and drink to me to see a clown: by my

18121,As you like it,19,5.1.27,TOUCHSTONE,"Why, thou sayest well. I do now remember a saying,"

18126,As you like it,19,5.1.32,TOUCHSTONE,meaning thereby that grapes were made to eat and
18127,As you like it,19,5.1.33,TOUCHSTONE,lips to open. You do love this maid?

18166,As you like it,2,5.2.8,OLIVER,"I love Aliena, say with her that she loves me,"
18167,As you like it,2,5.2.9,OLIVER,consent with both that we may enjoy each other: it
18168,As you like it,2,5.2.10,OLIVER,"shall be to your good, for my father's house and all"
18169,As you like it,2,5.2.11,OLIVER,the revenue that was old Sir Rowland's will I

18181,As you like it,7,5.2.21,ORLANDO,It is my arm.
18182,As you like it,8,5.2.22,ROSALIND,I thought thy heart had been wounded with the claws
18183,As you like it,8,5.2.23,ROSALIND,of a lion.
18184,As you like it,9,5.2.24,ORLANDO,"Wounded it is, but with the eyes of a lady."

18186,As you like it,10,5.2.26,ROSALIND,swoon when he showed me your handkerchief?
18187,As you like it,11,5.2.27,ORLANDO,"Ay, and greater wonders than that."
18188,As you like it,12,5.2.28,ROSALIND,"O, I know where you are: nay, 'tis true: there was"
18189,As you like it,12,5.2.29,ROSALIND,never any thing so sudden but the fight of two rams
18190,As you like it,12,5.2.30,ROSALIND,"and Caesar's thrasonical brag of 'I came, saw, and"
18191,As you like it,12,5.2.31,ROSALIND,overcame:' for your brother and my sister no sooner

18196,As you like it,12,5.2.36,ROSALIND,and in these degrees have they made a pair of stairs
18197,As you like it,12,5.2.37,ROSALIND,"to marriage which they will climb incontinent, or"
18198,As you like it,12,5.2.38,ROSALIND,else be incontinent before marriage: they are in
18199,As you like it,12,5.2.39,ROSALIND,"the very wrath of love and they will together, clubs"
18200,As you like it,12,5.2.40,ROSALIND,cannot part them.

18202,As you like it,13,5.2.42,ORLANDO,"duke to the nuptial. But, O, how bitter a thing it"
18203,As you like it,13,5.2.43,ORLANDO,is to look into happiness through another man's
18204,As you like it,13,5.2.44,ORLANDO,eyes! By so much the more shall I to-morrow be at
18205,As you like it,13,5.2.45,ORLANDO,"the height of heart-heaviness, by how much I shall"
18206,As you like it,13,5.2.46,ORLANDO,think my brother happy in having what he wishes for.
18207,As you like it,14,5.2.47,ROSALIND,"Why then, to-morrow I cannot serve your turn for Rosalind?"
18208,As you like it,15,5.2.48,ORLANDO,I can live no longer by thinking.
18209,As you like it,16,5.2.49,ROSALIND,I will weary you then no longer with idle talking.
18210,As you like it,16,5.2.50,ROSALIND,"Know of me then, for now I speak to some purpose,"
18211,As you like it,16,5.2.51,ROSALIND,that I know you are a gentleman of good conceit: I
18212,As you like it,16,5.2.52,ROSALIND,speak not this that you should bear a good opinion
18213,As you like it,16,5.2.53,ROSALIND,"of my knowledge, insomuch I say I know you are,"
18214,As you like it,16,5.2.54,ROSALIND,neither do I labour for a greater esteem than may in
18215,As you like it,16,5.2.55,ROSALIND,"some little measure draw a belief from you, to do"
18216,As you like it,16,5.2.56,ROSALIND,"yourself good and not to grace me. Believe then, if"
18217,As you like it,16,5.2.57,ROSALIND,"you please, that I can do strange things: I have,"
18218,As you like it,16,5.2.58,ROSALIND,"since I was three year old, conversed with a"
18219,As you like it,16,5.2.59,ROSALIND,"magician, most profound in his art and yet not"
18220,As you like it,16,5.2.60,ROSALIND,damnable. If you do love Rosalind so near the heart
18221,As you like it,16,5.2.61,ROSALIND,"as your gesture cries it out, when your brother"
18222,As you like it,16,5.2.62,ROSALIND,"marries Aliena, shall you marry her: I know into"
18223,As you like it,16,5.2.63,ROSALIND,"what straits of fortune she is driven, and it is"
18224,As you like it,16,5.2.64,ROSALIND,"not impossible to me, if it appear not inconvenient"
18225,As you like it,16,5.2.65,ROSALIND,"to you, to set her before your eyes tomorrow human"
18226,As you like it,16,5.2.66,ROSALIND,as she is and without any danger.
18227,As you like it,17,5.2.67,ORLANDO,Speakest thou in sober meanings?
18228,As you like it,18,5.2.68,ROSALIND,"By my life, I do, which I tender dearly, though I"
18229,As you like it,18,5.2.69,ROSALIND,"say I am a magician. Therefore, put you in your"
18230,As you like it,18,5.2.70,ROSALIND,"best array: bid your friends, for if you will be"
18231,As you like it,18,5.2.71,ROSALIND,"married to-morrow, you shall, and to Rosalind, if you will."

18234,As you like it,19,5.2.73,PHEBE,"Youth, you have done me much ungentleness,"
18235,As you like it,19,5.2.74,PHEBE,To show the letter that I writ to you.
18236,As you like it,20,5.2.75,ROSALIND,I care not if I have: it is my study
18237,As you like it,20,5.2.76,ROSALIND,To seem despiteful and ungentle to you:
18238,As you like it,20,5.2.77,ROSALIND,"You are there followed by a faithful shepherd,"
18239,As you like it,20,5.2.78,ROSALIND,"Look upon him, love him, he worships you."

18241,As you like it,22,5.2.80,SILVIUS,"It is to be all made of sighs and tears,"
18242,As you like it,22,5.2.81,SILVIUS,And so am I for Phebe.
18243,As you like it,23,5.2.82,PHEBE,And I for Ganymede.
18244,As you like it,24,5.2.83,ORLANDO,And I for Rosalind.
18245,As you like it,25,5.2.84,ROSALIND,And I for no woman.
18246,As you like it,26,5.2.85,SILVIUS,"It is to be all made of faith and service,"
18247,As you like it,26,5.2.86,SILVIUS,And so am I for Phebe.

18409,As you like it,28,5.4.73,TOUCHSTONE,called the Reply Churlish. If again 'it was not
18410,As you like it,28,5.4.74,TOUCHSTONE,"well cut,' he would answer, I spake not true: this"
18411,As you like it,28,5.4.75,TOUCHSTONE,is called the Reproof Valiant. If again 'it was not
18412,As you like it,28,5.4.76,TOUCHSTONE,"well cut,' he would say I lied: this is called the"

18417,As you like it,30,5.4.81,TOUCHSTONE,"nor he durst not give me the Lie Direct, and so we"

18546,As you like it,52,5.4.199,ROSALIND,"no bush, 'tis true that a good play needs no"
18547,As you like it,52,5.4.200,ROSALIND,"epilogue, yet to good wine they do use good bushes,"
18548,As you like it,52,5.4.201,ROSALIND,and good plays prove the better by the help of good
18549,As you like it,52,5.4.202,ROSALIND,"epilogues. What a case am I in then, that am"
18550,As you like it,52,5.4.203,ROSALIND,neither a good epilogue nor cannot insinuate with
18551,As you like it,52,5.4.204,ROSALIND,you in the behalf of a good play! I am not

18558,As you like it,52,5.4.211,ROSALIND,none of you hates them--that between you and the
18559,As you like it,52,5.4.212,ROSALIND,women the play may please. If I were a woman I
18560,As you like it,52,5.4.213,ROSALIND,would kiss as many of you as had beards that pleased
18561,As you like it,52,5.4.214,ROSALIND,"me, complexions that liked me and breaths that I"

18567,Antony and Cleopatra,52,,ROSALIND,SCENE I. Alexandria. A room in CLEOPATRA's palace.
18568,Antony and Cleopatra,52,,ROSALIND,Enter DEMETRIUS and PHILO
18569,Antony and Cleopatra,1,1.1.1,PHILO,"Nay, but this dotage of our general's"
18570,Antony and Cleopatra,1,1.1.2,PHILO,"O'erflows the measure: those his goodly eyes,"
18571,Antony and Cleopatra,1,1.1.3,PHILO,That o'er the files and musters of the war
18572,Antony and Cleopatra,1,1.1.4,PHILO,"Have glow'd like plated Mars, now bend, now turn,"
18573,Antony and Cleopatra,1,1.1.5,PHILO,The office and devotion of their view
18574,Antony and Cleopatra,1,1.1.6,PHILO,"Upon a tawny front: his captain's heart,"
18575,Antony and Cleopatra,1,1.1.7,PHILO,Which in the scuffles of great fights hath burst
18576,Antony and Cleopatra,1,1.1.8,PHILO,"The buckles on his breast, reneges all temper,"
18577,Antony and Cleopatra,1,1.1.9,PHILO,And is become the bellows and the fan
18578,Antony and Cleopatra,1,1.1.10,PHILO,To cool a gipsy's lust.
18579,Antony and Cleopatra,1,,PHILO,"Flourish. Enter ANTONY, CLEOPATRA, her Ladies, the Train, with Eunuchs fanning her"
18580,Antony and Cleopatra,1,1.1.11,PHILO,"Look, where they come:"
18581,Antony and Cleopatra,1,1.1.12,PHILO,"Take but good note, and you shall see in him."
18582,Antony and Cleopatra,1,1.1.13,PHILO,The triple pillar of the world transform'd
18583,Antony and Cleopatra,1,1.1.14,PHILO,Into a strumpet's fool: behold and see.
18584,Antony and Cleopatra,2,1.1.15,CLEOPATRA,"If it be love indeed, tell me how much."
18585,Antony and Cleopatra,3,1.1.16,MARK ANTONY,There's beggary in the love that can be reckon'd.
18586,Antony and Cleopatra,4,1.1.17,CLEOPATRA,I'll set a bourn how far to be beloved.
18587,Antony and Cleopatra,5,1.1.18,MARK ANTONY,"Then must thou needs find out new heaven, new earth."
18588,Antony and Cleopatra,5,,MARK ANTONY,Enter an Attendant
18589,Antony and Cleopatra,6,1.1.19,Attendant,"News, my good lord, from Rome."
18590,Antony and Cleopatra,7,1.1.20,MARK ANTONY,Grates me: the sum.
18591,Antony and Cleopatra,8,1.1.21,CLEOPATRA,"Nay, hear them, Antony:"
18592,Antony and Cleopatra,8,1.1.22,CLEOPATRA,"Fulvia perchance is angry, or, who knows"
18593,Antony and Cleopatra,8,1.1.23,CLEOPATRA,If the scarce-bearded Caesar have not sent
18594,Antony and Cleopatra,8,1.1.24,CLEOPATRA,"His powerful mandate to you, 'Do this, or this,"
18595,Antony and Cleopatra,8,1.1.25,CLEOPATRA,"Take in that kingdom, and enfranchise that,"
18596,Antony and Cleopatra,8,1.1.26,CLEOPATRA,"Perform 't, or else we damn thee.'"
18597,Antony and Cleopatra,9,1.1.27,MARK ANTONY,"How, my love!"
18598,Antony and Cleopatra,10,1.1.28,CLEOPATRA,"Perchance! nay, and most like:"
18599,Antony and Cleopatra,10,1.1.29,CLEOPATRA,"You must not stay here longer, your dismission"
18600,Antony and Cleopatra,10,1.1.30,CLEOPATRA,"Is come from Caesar, therefore hear it, Antony."
18601,Antony and Cleopatra,10,1.1.31,CLEOPATRA,Where's Fulvia's process? Caesar's I would say? both?
18602,Antony and Cleopatra,10,1.1.32,CLEOPATRA,"Call in the messengers. As I am Egypt's queen,"
18603,Antony and Cleopatra,10,1.1.33,CLEOPATRA,"Thou blushest, Antony, and that blood of thine"
18604,Antony and Cleopatra,10,1.1.34,CLEOPATRA,Is Caesar's homager: else so thy cheek pays shame
18605,Antony and Cleopatra,10,1.1.35,CLEOPATRA,When shrill-tongued Fulvia scolds. The messengers!
18606,Antony and Cleopatra,11,1.1.36,MARK ANTONY,"Let Rome in Tiber melt, and the wide arch"
18607,Antony and Cleopatra,11,1.1.37,MARK ANTONY,Of the ranged empire fall! Here is my space.
18608,Antony and Cleopatra,11,1.1.38,MARK ANTONY,Kingdoms are clay: our dungy earth alike
18609,Antony and Cleopatra,11,1.1.39,MARK ANTONY,Feeds beast as man: the nobleness of life
18610,Antony and Cleopatra,11,1.1.40,MARK ANTONY,"Is to do thus, when such a mutual pair"
18611,Antony and Cleopatra,11,,MARK ANTONY,Embracing
18612,Antony and Cleopatra,11,1.1.41,MARK ANTONY,"And such a twain can do't, in which I bind,"
18613,Antony and Cleopatra,11,1.1.42,MARK ANTONY,"On pain of punishment, the world to weet"
18614,Antony and Cleopatra,11,1.1.43,MARK ANTONY,We stand up peerless.
18615,Antony and Cleopatra,12,1.1.44,CLEOPATRA,Excellent falsehood!
18616,Antony and Cleopatra,12,1.1.45,CLEOPATRA,"Why did he marry Fulvia, and not love her?"
18617,Antony and Cleopatra,12,1.1.46,CLEOPATRA,"I'll seem the fool I am not, Antony"
18618,Antony and Cleopatra,12,1.1.47,CLEOPATRA,Will be himself.
18619,Antony and Cleopatra,13,1.1.48,MARK ANTONY,But stirr'd by Cleopatra.
18620,Antony and Cleopatra,13,1.1.49,MARK ANTONY,"Now, for the love of Love and her soft hours,"
18621,Antony and Cleopatra,13,1.1.50,MARK ANTONY,Let's not confound the time with conference harsh:
18622,Antony and Cleopatra,13,1.1.51,MARK ANTONY,There's not a minute of our lives should stretch
18623,Antony and Cleopatra,13,1.1.52,MARK ANTONY,Without some pleasure now. What sport tonight?
18624,Antony and Cleopatra,14,1.1.53,CLEOPATRA,Hear the ambassadors.
18625,Antony and Cleopatra,15,1.1.54,MARK ANTONY,"Fie, wrangling queen!"
18626,Antony and Cleopatra,15,1.1.55,MARK ANTONY,"Whom every thing becomes, to chide, to laugh,"
18627,Antony and Cleopatra,15,1.1.56,MARK ANTONY,"To weep, whose every passion fully strives"
18628,Antony and Cleopatra,15,1.1.57,MARK ANTONY,"To make itself, in thee, fair and admired!"
18629,Antony and Cleopatra,15,1.1.58,MARK ANTONY,"No messenger, but thine, and all alone"
18630,Antony and Cleopatra,15,1.1.59,MARK ANTONY,To-night we'll wander through the streets and note
18631,Antony and Cleopatra,15,1.1.60,MARK ANTONY,"The qualities of people. Come, my queen,"
18632,Antony and Cleopatra,15,1.1.61,MARK ANTONY,Last night you did desire it: speak not to us.
18633,Antony and Cleopatra,15,,MARK ANTONY,Exeunt MARK ANTONY and CLEOPATRA with their train
18634,Antony and Cleopatra,16,1.1.62,DEMETRIUS,Is Caesar with Antonius prized so slight?
18635,Antony and Cleopatra,17,1.1.63,PHILO,"Sir, sometimes, when he is not Antony,"
18636,Antony and Cleopatra,17,1.1.64,PHILO,He comes too short of that great property
18637,Antony and Cleopatra,17,1.1.65,PHILO,Which still should go with Antony.
18638,Antony and Cleopatra,18,1.1.66,DEMETRIUS,I am full sorry
18639,Antony and Cleopatra,18,1.1.67,DEMETRIUS,"That he approves the common liar, who"
18640,Antony and Cleopatra,18,1.1.68,DEMETRIUS,Thus speaks of him at Rome: but I will hope
18641,Antony and Cleopatra,18,1.1.69,DEMETRIUS,Of better deeds to-morrow. Rest you happy!
18642,Antony and Cleopatra,18,,DEMETRIUS,Exeunt

18653,Antony and Cleopatra,5,1.2.9,Soothsayer,In nature's infinite book of secrecy
18654,Antony and Cleopatra,5,1.2.10,Soothsayer,A little I can read.

18662,Antony and Cleopatra,11,1.2.17,Soothsayer,You shall be yet far fairer than you are.
18663,Antony and Cleopatra,12,1.2.18,CHARMIAN,He means in flesh.
18664,Antony and Cleopatra,13,1.2.19,IRAS,"No, you shall paint when you are old."
18665,Antony and Cleopatra,14,1.2.20,CHARMIAN,Wrinkles forbid!
18666,Antony and Cleopatra,15,1.2.21,ALEXAS,"Vex not his prescience, be attentive."

18668,Antony and Cleopatra,17,1.2.23,Soothsayer,You shall be more beloving than beloved.
18669,Antony and Cleopatra,18,1.2.24,CHARMIAN,I had rather heat my liver with drinking.

18674,Antony and Cleopatra,20,1.2.29,CHARMIAN,may do homage: find me to marry me with Octavius

18676,Antony and Cleopatra,21,1.2.31,Soothsayer,You shall outlive the lady whom you serve.

18678,Antony and Cleopatra,23,1.2.33,Soothsayer,You have seen and proved a fairer former fortune
18679,Antony and Cleopatra,23,1.2.34,Soothsayer,Than that which is to approach.
18680,Antony and Cleopatra,24,1.2.35,CHARMIAN,Then belike my children shall have no names:
18681,Antony and Cleopatra,24,1.2.36,CHARMIAN,"prithee, how many boys and wenches must I have?"

18685,Antony and Cleopatra,27,1.2.40,ALEXAS,You think none but your sheets are privy to your wishes.
18686,Antony and Cleopatra,28,1.2.41,CHARMIAN,"Nay, come, tell Iras hers."
18687,Antony and Cleopatra,29,1.2.42,ALEXAS,We'll know all our fortunes.

18691,Antony and Cleopatra,32,1.2.46,CHARMIAN,E'en as the o'erflowing Nilus presageth famine.
18692,Antony and Cleopatra,33,1.2.47,IRAS,"Go, you wild bedfellow, you cannot soothsay."
18693,Antony and Cleopatra,34,1.2.48,CHARMIAN,"Nay, if an oily palm be not a fruitful"
18694,Antony and Cleopatra,34,1.2.49,CHARMIAN,"prognostication, I cannot scratch mine ear. Prithee,"
18695,Antony and Cleopatra,34,1.2.50,CHARMIAN,tell her but a worky-day fortune.
18696,Antony and Cleopatra,35,1.2.51,Soothsayer,Your fortunes are alike.
18697,Antony and Cleopatra,36,1.2.52,IRAS,"But how, but how? give me particulars."
18698,Antony and Cleopatra,37,1.2.53,Soothsayer,I have said.
18699,Antony and Cleopatra,38,1.2.54,IRAS,Am I not an inch of fortune better than she?
18700,Antony and Cleopatra,39,1.2.55,CHARMIAN,"Well, if you were but an inch of fortune better than"
18701,Antony and Cleopatra,39,1.2.56,CHARMIAN,"I, where would you choose it?"
18702,Antony and Cleopatra,40,1.2.57,IRAS,Not in my husband's nose.
18703,Antony and Cleopatra,41,1.2.58,CHARMIAN,"Our worser thoughts heavens mend! Alexas,--come,"
18704,Antony and Cleopatra,41,1.2.59,CHARMIAN,"his fortune, his fortune! O, let him marry a woman"

18711,Antony and Cleopatra,42,1.2.66,IRAS,"Amen. Dear goddess, hear that prayer of the people!"
18712,Antony and Cleopatra,42,1.2.67,IRAS,"for, as it is a heartbreaking to see a handsome man"
18713,Antony and Cleopatra,42,1.2.68,IRAS,"loose-wived, so it is a deadly sorrow to behold a"
18714,Antony and Cleopatra,42,1.2.69,IRAS,"foul knave uncuckolded: therefore, dear Isis, keep"
18715,Antony and Cleopatra,42,1.2.70,IRAS,"decorum, and fortune him accordingly!"
18716,Antony and Cleopatra,43,1.2.71,CHARMIAN,Amen.
18717,Antony and Cleopatra,44,1.2.72,ALEXAS,"Lo, now, if it lay in their hands to make me a"

18725,Antony and Cleopatra,49,1.2.79,CLEOPATRA,Was he not here?
18726,Antony and Cleopatra,50,1.2.80,CHARMIAN,"No, madam."

18728,Antony and Cleopatra,51,1.2.82,CLEOPATRA,A Roman thought hath struck him. Enobarbus!
18729,Antony and Cleopatra,52,1.2.83,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,Madam?
18730,Antony and Cleopatra,53,1.2.84,CLEOPATRA,"Seek him, and bring him hither."
18731,Antony and Cleopatra,53,1.2.85,CLEOPATRA,Where's Alexas?
18732,Antony and Cleopatra,54,1.2.86,ALEXAS,"Here, at your service. My lord approaches."

18743,Antony and Cleopatra,59,1.2.95,MARK ANTONY,"Well, what worst?"
18744,Antony and Cleopatra,60,1.2.96,Messenger,The nature of bad news infects the teller.
18745,Antony and Cleopatra,61,1.2.97,MARK ANTONY,When it concerns the fool or coward. On:

18748,Antony and Cleopatra,61,1.2.100,MARK ANTONY,I hear him as he flatter'd.

18767,Antony and Cleopatra,69,1.2.118,Second Attendant,He stays upon your will.
18768,Antony and Cleopatra,70,1.2.119,MARK ANTONY,Let him appear.
18769,Antony and Cleopatra,70,1.2.120,MARK ANTONY,"These strong Egyptian fetters I must break,"
18770,Antony and Cleopatra,70,1.2.121,MARK ANTONY,Or lose myself in dotage.

18773,Antony and Cleopatra,71,1.2.123,Second Messenger,Fulvia thy wife is dead.
18774,Antony and Cleopatra,72,1.2.124,MARK ANTONY,Where died she?
18775,Antony and Cleopatra,73,1.2.125,Second Messenger,In Sicyon:

18780,Antony and Cleopatra,74,,MARK ANTONY,Exit Second Messenger
18781,Antony and Cleopatra,74,1.2.129,MARK ANTONY,There's a great spirit gone! Thus did I desire it:
18782,Antony and Cleopatra,74,1.2.130,MARK ANTONY,"What our contempt doth often hurl from us,"
18783,Antony and Cleopatra,74,1.2.131,MARK ANTONY,"We wish it ours again, the present pleasure,"
18784,Antony and Cleopatra,74,1.2.132,MARK ANTONY,"By revolution lowering, does become"
18785,Antony and Cleopatra,74,1.2.133,MARK ANTONY,"The opposite of itself: she's good, being gone,"
18786,Antony and Cleopatra,74,1.2.134,MARK ANTONY,The hand could pluck her back that shoved her on.
18787,Antony and Cleopatra,74,1.2.135,MARK ANTONY,I must from this enchanting queen break off:
18788,Antony and Cleopatra,74,1.2.136,MARK ANTONY,"Ten thousand harms, more than the ills I know,"
18789,Antony and Cleopatra,74,1.2.137,MARK ANTONY,My idleness doth hatch. How now! Enobarbus!
18790,Antony and Cleopatra,74,,MARK ANTONY,Re-enter DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
18791,Antony and Cleopatra,75,1.2.138,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"What's your pleasure, sir?"
18792,Antony and Cleopatra,76,1.2.139,MARK ANTONY,I must with haste from hence.
18793,Antony and Cleopatra,77,1.2.140,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Why, then, we kill all our women:"
18794,Antony and Cleopatra,77,1.2.141,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"we see how mortal an unkindness is to them,"
18795,Antony and Cleopatra,77,1.2.142,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"if they suffer our departure, death's the word."
18796,Antony and Cleopatra,78,1.2.143,MARK ANTONY,I must be gone.
18797,Antony and Cleopatra,79,1.2.144,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Under a compelling occasion, let women die, it were"
18798,Antony and Cleopatra,79,1.2.145,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"pity to cast them away for nothing, though, between"
18799,Antony and Cleopatra,79,1.2.146,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"them and a great cause, they should be esteemed"
18800,Antony and Cleopatra,79,1.2.147,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"nothing. Cleopatra, catching but the least noise of"

18802,Antony and Cleopatra,79,1.2.149,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,times upon far poorer moment: I do think there is
18803,Antony and Cleopatra,79,1.2.150,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"mettle in death, which commits some loving act upon"
18804,Antony and Cleopatra,79,1.2.151,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"her, she hath such a celerity in dying."
18805,Antony and Cleopatra,80,1.2.152,MARK ANTONY,She is cunning past man's thought.
18806,Antony and Cleopatra,80,,MARK ANTONY,Exit ALEXAS
18807,Antony and Cleopatra,81,1.2.153,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Alack, sir, no, her passions are made of nothing but"
18808,Antony and Cleopatra,81,1.2.154,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,the finest part of pure love: we cannot call her
18809,Antony and Cleopatra,81,1.2.155,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"winds and waters sighs and tears, they are greater"
18810,Antony and Cleopatra,81,1.2.156,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,storms and tempests than almanacs can report: this
18811,Antony and Cleopatra,81,1.2.157,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"cannot be cunning in her, if it be, she makes a"
18812,Antony and Cleopatra,81,1.2.158,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,shower of rain as well as Jove.
18813,Antony and Cleopatra,82,1.2.159,MARK ANTONY,Would I had never seen her.
18814,Antony and Cleopatra,83,1.2.160,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"O, sir, you had then left unseen a wonderful piece"
18815,Antony and Cleopatra,83,1.2.161,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"of work, which not to have been blest withal would"
18816,Antony and Cleopatra,83,1.2.162,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,have discredited your travel.
18817,Antony and Cleopatra,84,1.2.163,MARK ANTONY,Fulvia is dead.
18818,Antony and Cleopatra,85,1.2.164,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,Sir?
18819,Antony and Cleopatra,86,1.2.165,MARK ANTONY,Fulvia is dead.
18820,Antony and Cleopatra,87,1.2.166,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,Fulvia!
18821,Antony and Cleopatra,88,1.2.167,MARK ANTONY,Dead.
18822,Antony and Cleopatra,89,1.2.168,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Why, sir, give the gods a thankful sacrifice. When"
18823,Antony and Cleopatra,89,1.2.169,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,it pleaseth their deities to take the wife of a man
18824,Antony and Cleopatra,89,1.2.170,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"from him, it shows to man the tailors of the earth,"
18825,Antony and Cleopatra,89,1.2.171,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"comforting therein, that when old robes are worn"
18826,Antony and Cleopatra,89,1.2.172,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"out, there are members to make new. If there were"
18827,Antony and Cleopatra,89,1.2.173,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"no more women but Fulvia, then had you indeed a cut,"
18828,Antony and Cleopatra,89,1.2.174,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,and the case to be lamented: this grief is crowned

18830,Antony and Cleopatra,89,1.2.176,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,petticoat: and indeed the tears live in an onion
18831,Antony and Cleopatra,89,1.2.177,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,that should water this sorrow.
18832,Antony and Cleopatra,90,1.2.178,MARK ANTONY,The business she hath broached in the state
18833,Antony and Cleopatra,90,1.2.179,MARK ANTONY,Cannot endure my absence.
18834,Antony and Cleopatra,91,1.2.180,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,And the business you have broached here cannot be

18836,Antony and Cleopatra,91,1.2.182,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,wholly depends on your abode.
18837,Antony and Cleopatra,92,1.2.183,MARK ANTONY,No more light answers. Let our officers
18838,Antony and Cleopatra,92,1.2.184,MARK ANTONY,Have notice what we purpose. I shall break

18899,Antony and Cleopatra,19,1.3.36,CLEOPATRA,"Who have been false to Fulvia? Riotous madness,"
18900,Antony and Cleopatra,19,1.3.37,CLEOPATRA,"To be entangled with those mouth-made vows,"
18901,Antony and Cleopatra,19,1.3.38,CLEOPATRA,Which break themselves in swearing!
18902,Antony and Cleopatra,20,1.3.39,MARK ANTONY,"Most sweet queen,--"
18903,Antony and Cleopatra,21,1.3.40,CLEOPATRA,"Nay, pray you, seek no colour for your going,"
18904,Antony and Cleopatra,21,1.3.41,CLEOPATRA,"But bid farewell, and go: when you sued staying,"
18905,Antony and Cleopatra,21,1.3.42,CLEOPATRA,"Then was the time for words: no going then,"
18906,Antony and Cleopatra,21,1.3.43,CLEOPATRA,"Eternity was in our lips and eyes,"
18907,Antony and Cleopatra,21,1.3.44,CLEOPATRA,"Bliss in our brows' bent, none our parts so poor,"
18908,Antony and Cleopatra,21,1.3.45,CLEOPATRA,"But was a race of heaven: they are so still,"
18909,Antony and Cleopatra,21,1.3.46,CLEOPATRA,"Or thou, the greatest soldier of the world,"
18910,Antony and Cleopatra,21,1.3.47,CLEOPATRA,Art turn'd the greatest liar.
18911,Antony and Cleopatra,22,1.3.48,MARK ANTONY,"How now, lady!"
18912,Antony and Cleopatra,23,1.3.49,CLEOPATRA,"I would I had thy inches, thou shouldst know"
18913,Antony and Cleopatra,23,1.3.50,CLEOPATRA,There were a heart in Egypt.
18914,Antony and Cleopatra,24,1.3.51,MARK ANTONY,"Hear me, queen:"
18915,Antony and Cleopatra,24,1.3.52,MARK ANTONY,The strong necessity of time commands
18916,Antony and Cleopatra,24,1.3.53,MARK ANTONY,"Our services awhile, but my full heart"
18917,Antony and Cleopatra,24,1.3.54,MARK ANTONY,Remains in use with you. Our Italy
18918,Antony and Cleopatra,24,1.3.55,MARK ANTONY,Shines o'er with civil swords: Sextus Pompeius
18919,Antony and Cleopatra,24,1.3.56,MARK ANTONY,Makes his approaches to the port of Rome:
18920,Antony and Cleopatra,24,1.3.57,MARK ANTONY,Equality of two domestic powers
18921,Antony and Cleopatra,24,1.3.58,MARK ANTONY,"Breed scrupulous faction: the hated, grown to strength,"
18922,Antony and Cleopatra,24,1.3.59,MARK ANTONY,"Are newly grown to love: the condemn'd Pompey,"
18923,Antony and Cleopatra,24,1.3.60,MARK ANTONY,"Rich in his father's honour, creeps apace,"
18924,Antony and Cleopatra,24,1.3.61,MARK ANTONY,Into the hearts of such as have not thrived
18925,Antony and Cleopatra,24,1.3.62,MARK ANTONY,"Upon the present state, whose numbers threaten,"
18926,Antony and Cleopatra,24,1.3.63,MARK ANTONY,"And quietness, grown sick of rest, would purge"
18927,Antony and Cleopatra,24,1.3.64,MARK ANTONY,"By any desperate change: my more particular,"
18928,Antony and Cleopatra,24,1.3.65,MARK ANTONY,"And that which most with you should safe my going,"
18929,Antony and Cleopatra,24,1.3.66,MARK ANTONY,Is Fulvia's death.
18930,Antony and Cleopatra,25,1.3.67,CLEOPATRA,"Though age from folly could not give me freedom,"
18931,Antony and Cleopatra,25,1.3.68,CLEOPATRA,It does from childishness: can Fulvia die?
18932,Antony and Cleopatra,26,1.3.69,MARK ANTONY,"She's dead, my queen:"
18933,Antony and Cleopatra,26,1.3.70,MARK ANTONY,"Look here, and at thy sovereign leisure read"
18934,Antony and Cleopatra,26,1.3.71,MARK ANTONY,"The garboils she awaked, at the last, best:"
18935,Antony and Cleopatra,26,1.3.72,MARK ANTONY,See when and where she died.
18936,Antony and Cleopatra,27,1.3.73,CLEOPATRA,O most false love!
18937,Antony and Cleopatra,27,1.3.74,CLEOPATRA,Where be the sacred vials thou shouldst fill
18938,Antony and Cleopatra,27,1.3.75,CLEOPATRA,"With sorrowful water? Now I see, I see,"
18939,Antony and Cleopatra,27,1.3.76,CLEOPATRA,"In Fulvia's death, how mine received shall be."
18940,Antony and Cleopatra,28,1.3.77,MARK ANTONY,"Quarrel no more, but be prepared to know"
18941,Antony and Cleopatra,28,1.3.78,MARK ANTONY,"The purposes I bear, which are, or cease,"
18942,Antony and Cleopatra,28,1.3.79,MARK ANTONY,As you shall give the advice. By the fire
18943,Antony and Cleopatra,28,1.3.80,MARK ANTONY,"That quickens Nilus' slime, I go from hence"
18944,Antony and Cleopatra,28,1.3.81,MARK ANTONY,"Thy soldier, servant, making peace or war"
18945,Antony and Cleopatra,28,1.3.82,MARK ANTONY,As thou affect'st.
18946,Antony and Cleopatra,29,1.3.83,CLEOPATRA,"Cut my lace, Charmian, come,"
18947,Antony and Cleopatra,29,1.3.84,CLEOPATRA,"But let it be: I am quickly ill, and well,"
18948,Antony and Cleopatra,29,1.3.85,CLEOPATRA,So Antony loves.
18949,Antony and Cleopatra,30,1.3.86,MARK ANTONY,"My precious queen, forbear,"
18950,Antony and Cleopatra,30,1.3.87,MARK ANTONY,"And give true evidence to his love, which stands"
18951,Antony and Cleopatra,30,1.3.88,MARK ANTONY,An honourable trial.
18952,Antony and Cleopatra,31,1.3.89,CLEOPATRA,So Fulvia told me.
18953,Antony and Cleopatra,31,1.3.90,CLEOPATRA,"I prithee, turn aside and weep for her,"
18954,Antony and Cleopatra,31,1.3.91,CLEOPATRA,"Then bid adieu to me, and say the tears"
18955,Antony and Cleopatra,31,1.3.92,CLEOPATRA,"Belong to Egypt: good now, play one scene"
18956,Antony and Cleopatra,31,1.3.93,CLEOPATRA,"Of excellent dissembling, and let it look"
18957,Antony and Cleopatra,31,1.3.94,CLEOPATRA,Life perfect honour.
18958,Antony and Cleopatra,32,1.3.95,MARK ANTONY,You'll heat my blood: no more.
18959,Antony and Cleopatra,33,1.3.96,CLEOPATRA,"You can do better yet, but this is meetly."
18960,Antony and Cleopatra,34,1.3.97,MARK ANTONY,"Now, by my sword,--"
18961,Antony and Cleopatra,35,1.3.98,CLEOPATRA,"And target. Still he mends,"
18962,Antony and Cleopatra,35,1.3.99,CLEOPATRA,"But this is not the best. Look, prithee, Charmian,"
18963,Antony and Cleopatra,35,1.3.100,CLEOPATRA,How this Herculean Roman does become
18964,Antony and Cleopatra,35,1.3.101,CLEOPATRA,The carriage of his chafe.
18965,Antony and Cleopatra,36,1.3.102,MARK ANTONY,"I'll leave you, lady."
18966,Antony and Cleopatra,37,1.3.103,CLEOPATRA,"Courteous lord, one word."
18967,Antony and Cleopatra,37,1.3.104,CLEOPATRA,"Sir, you and I must part, but that's not it:"
18968,Antony and Cleopatra,37,1.3.105,CLEOPATRA,"Sir, you and I have loved, but there's not it,"
18969,Antony and Cleopatra,37,1.3.106,CLEOPATRA,"That you know well: something it is I would,"
18970,Antony and Cleopatra,37,1.3.107,CLEOPATRA,"O, my oblivion is a very Antony,"
18971,Antony and Cleopatra,37,1.3.108,CLEOPATRA,And I am all forgotten.
18972,Antony and Cleopatra,38,1.3.109,MARK ANTONY,But that your royalty
18973,Antony and Cleopatra,38,1.3.110,MARK ANTONY,"Holds idleness your subject, I should take you"
18974,Antony and Cleopatra,38,1.3.111,MARK ANTONY,For idleness itself.
18975,Antony and Cleopatra,39,1.3.112,CLEOPATRA,'Tis sweating labour
18976,Antony and Cleopatra,39,1.3.113,CLEOPATRA,To bear such idleness so near the heart
18977,Antony and Cleopatra,39,1.3.114,CLEOPATRA,"As Cleopatra this. But, sir, forgive me,"
18978,Antony and Cleopatra,39,1.3.115,CLEOPATRA,"Since my becomings kill me, when they do not"
18979,Antony and Cleopatra,39,1.3.116,CLEOPATRA,"Eye well to you: your honour calls you hence,"
18980,Antony and Cleopatra,39,1.3.117,CLEOPATRA,Therefore be deaf to my unpitied folly.
18981,Antony and Cleopatra,39,1.3.118,CLEOPATRA,And all the gods go with you! upon your sword
18982,Antony and Cleopatra,39,1.3.119,CLEOPATRA,Sit laurel victory! and smooth success
18983,Antony and Cleopatra,39,1.3.120,CLEOPATRA,Be strew'd before your feet!
18984,Antony and Cleopatra,40,1.3.121,MARK ANTONY,"Let us go. Come,"
18985,Antony and Cleopatra,40,1.3.122,MARK ANTONY,"Our separation so abides, and flies,"
18986,Antony and Cleopatra,40,1.3.123,MARK ANTONY,"That thou, residing here, go'st yet with me,"
18987,Antony and Cleopatra,40,1.3.124,MARK ANTONY,"And I, hence fleeting, here remain with thee. Away!"
18988,Antony and Cleopatra,40,,MARK ANTONY,Exeunt
18989,Antony and Cleopatra,40,,MARK ANTONY,SCENE IV. Rome. OCTAVIUS CAESAR's house.
18990,Antony and Cleopatra,40,,MARK ANTONY,"Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, reading a letter, LEPIDUS, and their Train"
18991,Antony and Cleopatra,1,1.4.1,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"You may see, Lepidus, and henceforth know,"
18992,Antony and Cleopatra,1,1.4.2,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,It is not Caesar's natural vice to hate
18993,Antony and Cleopatra,1,1.4.3,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,Our great competitor: from Alexandria
18994,Antony and Cleopatra,1,1.4.4,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"This is the news: he fishes, drinks, and wastes"
18995,Antony and Cleopatra,1,1.4.5,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"The lamps of night in revel, is not more man-like"
18996,Antony and Cleopatra,1,1.4.6,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Than Cleopatra, nor the queen of Ptolemy"
18997,Antony and Cleopatra,1,1.4.7,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"More womanly than he, hardly gave audience, or"
18998,Antony and Cleopatra,1,1.4.8,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,Vouchsafed to think he had partners: you shall find there
18999,Antony and Cleopatra,1,1.4.9,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,A man who is the abstract of all faults
19000,Antony and Cleopatra,1,1.4.10,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,That all men follow.
19001,Antony and Cleopatra,2,1.4.11,LEPIDUS,I must not think there are
19002,Antony and Cleopatra,2,1.4.12,LEPIDUS,Evils enow to darken all his goodness:
19003,Antony and Cleopatra,2,1.4.13,LEPIDUS,"His faults in him seem as the spots of heaven,"
19004,Antony and Cleopatra,2,1.4.14,LEPIDUS,"More fiery by night's blackness, hereditary,"
19005,Antony and Cleopatra,2,1.4.15,LEPIDUS,"Rather than purchased, what he cannot change,"
19006,Antony and Cleopatra,2,1.4.16,LEPIDUS,Than what he chooses.
19007,Antony and Cleopatra,3,1.4.17,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"You are too indulgent. Let us grant, it is not"
19008,Antony and Cleopatra,3,1.4.18,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Amiss to tumble on the bed of Ptolemy,"
19009,Antony and Cleopatra,3,1.4.19,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"To give a kingdom for a mirth, to sit"
19010,Antony and Cleopatra,3,1.4.20,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"And keep the turn of tippling with a slave,"
19011,Antony and Cleopatra,3,1.4.21,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"To reel the streets at noon, and stand the buffet"
19012,Antony and Cleopatra,3,1.4.22,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,With knaves that smell of sweat: say this
19013,Antony and Cleopatra,3,1.4.23,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"becomes him,--"
19014,Antony and Cleopatra,3,1.4.24,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,As his composure must be rare indeed
19015,Antony and Cleopatra,3,1.4.25,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Whom these things cannot blemish,--yet must Antony"
19016,Antony and Cleopatra,3,1.4.26,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"No way excuse his soils, when we do bear"
19017,Antony and Cleopatra,3,1.4.27,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,So great weight in his lightness. If he fill'd
19018,Antony and Cleopatra,3,1.4.28,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"His vacancy with his voluptuousness,"
19019,Antony and Cleopatra,3,1.4.29,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Full surfeits, and the dryness of his bones,"
19020,Antony and Cleopatra,3,1.4.30,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Call on him for't: but to confound such time,"
19021,Antony and Cleopatra,3,1.4.31,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"That drums him from his sport, and speaks as loud"
19022,Antony and Cleopatra,3,1.4.32,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"As his own state and ours,--'tis to be chid"
19023,Antony and Cleopatra,3,1.4.33,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"As we rate boys, who, being mature in knowledge,"
19024,Antony and Cleopatra,3,1.4.34,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Pawn their experience to their present pleasure,"
19025,Antony and Cleopatra,3,1.4.35,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,And so rebel to judgment.
19026,Antony and Cleopatra,3,,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,Enter a Messenger
19027,Antony and Cleopatra,4,1.4.36,LEPIDUS,Here's more news.
19028,Antony and Cleopatra,5,1.4.37,Messenger,"Thy biddings have been done, and every hour,"
19029,Antony and Cleopatra,5,1.4.38,Messenger,"Most noble Caesar, shalt thou have report"
19030,Antony and Cleopatra,5,1.4.39,Messenger,"How 'tis abroad. Pompey is strong at sea,"
19031,Antony and Cleopatra,5,1.4.40,Messenger,And it appears he is beloved of those
19032,Antony and Cleopatra,5,1.4.41,Messenger,That only have fear'd Caesar: to the ports
19033,Antony and Cleopatra,5,1.4.42,Messenger,"The discontents repair, and men's reports"
19034,Antony and Cleopatra,5,1.4.43,Messenger,Give him much wrong'd.
19035,Antony and Cleopatra,6,1.4.44,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,I should have known no less.
19036,Antony and Cleopatra,6,1.4.45,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"It hath been taught us from the primal state,"
19037,Antony and Cleopatra,6,1.4.46,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"That he which is was wish'd until he were,"
19038,Antony and Cleopatra,6,1.4.47,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"And the ebb'd man, ne'er loved till ne'er worth love,"
19039,Antony and Cleopatra,6,1.4.48,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Comes dear'd by being lack'd. This common body,"
19040,Antony and Cleopatra,6,1.4.49,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Like to a vagabond flag upon the stream,"
19041,Antony and Cleopatra,6,1.4.50,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Goes to and back, lackeying the varying tide,"
19042,Antony and Cleopatra,6,1.4.51,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,To rot itself with motion.
19043,Antony and Cleopatra,7,1.4.52,Messenger,"Caesar, I bring thee word,"
19044,Antony and Cleopatra,7,1.4.53,Messenger,"Menecrates and Menas, famous pirates,"
19045,Antony and Cleopatra,7,1.4.54,Messenger,"Make the sea serve them, which they ear and wound"
19046,Antony and Cleopatra,7,1.4.55,Messenger,With keels of every kind: many hot inroads
19047,Antony and Cleopatra,7,1.4.56,Messenger,"They make in Italy, the borders maritime"
19048,Antony and Cleopatra,7,1.4.57,Messenger,"Lack blood to think on't, and flush youth revolt:"
19049,Antony and Cleopatra,7,1.4.58,Messenger,"No vessel can peep forth, but 'tis as soon"
19050,Antony and Cleopatra,7,1.4.59,Messenger,"Taken as seen, for Pompey's name strikes more"
19051,Antony and Cleopatra,7,1.4.60,Messenger,Than could his war resisted.
19052,Antony and Cleopatra,8,1.4.61,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Antony,"
19053,Antony and Cleopatra,8,1.4.62,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,Leave thy lascivious wassails. When thou once
19054,Antony and Cleopatra,8,1.4.63,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Wast beaten from Modena, where thou slew'st"
19055,Antony and Cleopatra,8,1.4.64,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Hirtius and Pansa, consuls, at thy heel"
19056,Antony and Cleopatra,8,1.4.65,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Did famine follow, whom thou fought'st against,"
19057,Antony and Cleopatra,8,1.4.66,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Though daintily brought up, with patience more"
19058,Antony and Cleopatra,8,1.4.67,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,Than savages could suffer: thou didst drink
19059,Antony and Cleopatra,8,1.4.68,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"The stale of horses, and the gilded puddle"
19060,Antony and Cleopatra,8,1.4.69,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,Which beasts would cough at: thy palate then did deign
19061,Antony and Cleopatra,8,1.4.70,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"The roughest berry on the rudest hedge,"
19062,Antony and Cleopatra,8,1.4.71,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Yea, like the stag, when snow the pasture sheets,"
19063,Antony and Cleopatra,8,1.4.72,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"The barks of trees thou browsed'st, on the Alps"
19064,Antony and Cleopatra,8,1.4.73,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"It is reported thou didst eat strange flesh,"
19065,Antony and Cleopatra,8,1.4.74,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,Which some did die to look on: and all this--
19066,Antony and Cleopatra,8,1.4.75,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,It wounds thine honour that I speak it now--
19067,Antony and Cleopatra,8,1.4.76,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Was borne so like a soldier, that thy cheek"
19068,Antony and Cleopatra,8,1.4.77,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,So much as lank'd not.
19069,Antony and Cleopatra,9,1.4.78,LEPIDUS,'Tis pity of him.
19070,Antony and Cleopatra,10,1.4.79,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,Let his shames quickly
19071,Antony and Cleopatra,10,1.4.80,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,Drive him to Rome: 'tis time we twain
19072,Antony and Cleopatra,10,1.4.81,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Did show ourselves i' the field, and to that end"
19073,Antony and Cleopatra,10,1.4.82,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,Assemble we immediate council: Pompey
19074,Antony and Cleopatra,10,1.4.83,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,Thrives in our idleness.
19075,Antony and Cleopatra,11,1.4.84,LEPIDUS,"To-morrow, Caesar,"
19076,Antony and Cleopatra,11,1.4.85,LEPIDUS,I shall be furnish'd to inform you rightly
19077,Antony and Cleopatra,11,1.4.86,LEPIDUS,Both what by sea and land I can be able
19078,Antony and Cleopatra,11,1.4.87,LEPIDUS,To front this present time.
19079,Antony and Cleopatra,12,1.4.88,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Till which encounter,"
19080,Antony and Cleopatra,12,1.4.89,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,It is my business too. Farewell.
19081,Antony and Cleopatra,13,1.4.90,LEPIDUS,"Farewell, my lord: what you shall know meantime"
19082,Antony and Cleopatra,13,1.4.91,LEPIDUS,"Of stirs abroad, I shall beseech you, sir,"
19083,Antony and Cleopatra,13,1.4.92,LEPIDUS,To let me be partaker.
19084,Antony and Cleopatra,14,1.4.93,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Doubt not, sir,"
19085,Antony and Cleopatra,14,1.4.94,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,I knew it for my bond.
19086,Antony and Cleopatra,14,,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,Exeunt
19087,Antony and Cleopatra,14,,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,SCENE V. Alexandria. CLEOPATRA's palace.
19088,Antony and Cleopatra,14,,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Enter CLEOPATRA, CHARMIAN, IRAS, and MARDIAN"
19089,Antony and Cleopatra,1,1.5.1,CLEOPATRA,Charmian!
19090,Antony and Cleopatra,2,1.5.2,CHARMIAN,Madam?
19091,Antony and Cleopatra,3,1.5.3,CLEOPATRA,"Ha, ha!"
19092,Antony and Cleopatra,3,1.5.4,CLEOPATRA,Give me to drink mandragora.
19093,Antony and Cleopatra,4,1.5.5,CHARMIAN,"Why, madam?"
19094,Antony and Cleopatra,5,1.5.6,CLEOPATRA,That I might sleep out this great gap of time
19095,Antony and Cleopatra,5,1.5.7,CLEOPATRA,My Antony is away.
19096,Antony and Cleopatra,6,1.5.8,CHARMIAN,You think of him too much.
19097,Antony and Cleopatra,7,1.5.9,CLEOPATRA,"O, 'tis treason!"
19098,Antony and Cleopatra,8,1.5.10,CHARMIAN,"Madam, I trust, not so."
19099,Antony and Cleopatra,9,1.5.11,CLEOPATRA,"Thou, eunuch Mardian!"
19100,Antony and Cleopatra,10,1.5.12,MARDIAN,What's your highness' pleasure?
19101,Antony and Cleopatra,11,1.5.13,CLEOPATRA,"Not now to hear thee sing, I take no pleasure"
19102,Antony and Cleopatra,11,1.5.14,CLEOPATRA,"In aught an eunuch has: 'tis well for thee,"
19103,Antony and Cleopatra,11,1.5.15,CLEOPATRA,"That, being unseminar'd, thy freer thoughts"
19104,Antony and Cleopatra,11,1.5.16,CLEOPATRA,May not fly forth of Egypt. Hast thou affections?
19105,Antony and Cleopatra,12,1.5.17,MARDIAN,"Yes, gracious madam."
19106,Antony and Cleopatra,13,1.5.18,CLEOPATRA,Indeed!
19107,Antony and Cleopatra,14,1.5.19,MARDIAN,"Not in deed, madam, for I can do nothing"
19108,Antony and Cleopatra,14,1.5.20,MARDIAN,But what indeed is honest to be done:
19109,Antony and Cleopatra,14,1.5.21,MARDIAN,"Yet have I fierce affections, and think"
19110,Antony and Cleopatra,14,1.5.22,MARDIAN,What Venus did with Mars.
19111,Antony and Cleopatra,15,1.5.23,CLEOPATRA,"O Charmian,"
19112,Antony and Cleopatra,15,1.5.24,CLEOPATRA,"Where think'st thou he is now? Stands he, or sits he?"
19113,Antony and Cleopatra,15,1.5.25,CLEOPATRA,Or does he walk? or is he on his horse?
19114,Antony and Cleopatra,15,1.5.26,CLEOPATRA,"O happy horse, to bear the weight of Antony!"
19115,Antony and Cleopatra,15,1.5.27,CLEOPATRA,"Do bravely, horse! for wot'st thou whom thou movest?"
19116,Antony and Cleopatra,15,1.5.28,CLEOPATRA,"The demi-Atlas of this earth, the arm"
19117,Antony and Cleopatra,15,1.5.29,CLEOPATRA,"And burgonet of men. He's speaking now,"
19118,Antony and Cleopatra,15,1.5.30,CLEOPATRA,Or murmuring 'Where's my serpent of old Nile?'
19119,Antony and Cleopatra,15,1.5.31,CLEOPATRA,For so he calls me: now I feed myself
19120,Antony and Cleopatra,15,1.5.32,CLEOPATRA,"With most delicious poison. Think on me,"
19121,Antony and Cleopatra,15,1.5.33,CLEOPATRA,"That am with Phoebus' amorous pinches black,"
19122,Antony and Cleopatra,15,1.5.34,CLEOPATRA,"And wrinkled deep in time? Broad-fronted Caesar,"
19123,Antony and Cleopatra,15,1.5.35,CLEOPATRA,"When thou wast here above the ground, I was"
19124,Antony and Cleopatra,15,1.5.36,CLEOPATRA,A morsel for a monarch: and great Pompey
19125,Antony and Cleopatra,15,1.5.37,CLEOPATRA,"Would stand and make his eyes grow in my brow,"
19126,Antony and Cleopatra,15,1.5.38,CLEOPATRA,There would he anchor his aspect and die
19127,Antony and Cleopatra,15,1.5.39,CLEOPATRA,With looking on his life.
19128,Antony and Cleopatra,15,,CLEOPATRA,"Enter ALEXAS, from OCTAVIUS CAESAR"
19129,Antony and Cleopatra,16,1.5.40,ALEXAS,"Sovereign of Egypt, hail!"
19130,Antony and Cleopatra,17,1.5.41,CLEOPATRA,How much unlike art thou Mark Antony!
19131,Antony and Cleopatra,17,1.5.42,CLEOPATRA,"Yet, coming from him, that great medicine hath"
19132,Antony and Cleopatra,17,1.5.43,CLEOPATRA,With his tinct gilded thee.
19133,Antony and Cleopatra,17,1.5.44,CLEOPATRA,How goes it with my brave Mark Antony?
19134,Antony and Cleopatra,18,1.5.45,ALEXAS,"Last thing he did, dear queen,"
19135,Antony and Cleopatra,18,1.5.46,ALEXAS,"He kiss'd,--the last of many doubled kisses,--"
19136,Antony and Cleopatra,18,1.5.47,ALEXAS,This orient pearl. His speech sticks in my heart.
19137,Antony and Cleopatra,19,1.5.48,CLEOPATRA,Mine ear must pluck it thence.
19138,Antony and Cleopatra,20,1.5.49,ALEXAS,"'Good friend,' quoth he,"
19139,Antony and Cleopatra,20,1.5.50,ALEXAS,"'Say, the firm Roman to great Egypt sends"
19140,Antony and Cleopatra,20,1.5.51,ALEXAS,"This treasure of an oyster, at whose foot,"
19141,Antony and Cleopatra,20,1.5.52,ALEXAS,"To mend the petty present, I will piece"
19142,Antony and Cleopatra,20,1.5.53,ALEXAS,"Her opulent throne with kingdoms, all the east,"
19143,Antony and Cleopatra,20,1.5.54,ALEXAS,"Say thou, shall call her mistress.' So he nodded,"
19144,Antony and Cleopatra,20,1.5.55,ALEXAS,"And soberly did mount an arm-gaunt steed,"
19145,Antony and Cleopatra,20,1.5.56,ALEXAS,"Who neigh'd so high, that what I would have spoke"
19146,Antony and Cleopatra,20,1.5.57,ALEXAS,Was beastly dumb'd by him.
19147,Antony and Cleopatra,21,1.5.58,CLEOPATRA,"What, was he sad or merry?"
19148,Antony and Cleopatra,22,1.5.59,ALEXAS,Like to the time o' the year between the extremes
19149,Antony and Cleopatra,22,1.5.60,ALEXAS,"Of hot and cold, he was nor sad nor merry."
19150,Antony and Cleopatra,23,1.5.61,CLEOPATRA,"O well-divided disposition! Note him,"
19151,Antony and Cleopatra,23,1.5.62,CLEOPATRA,"Note him good Charmian, 'tis the man, but note him:"
19152,Antony and Cleopatra,23,1.5.63,CLEOPATRA,"He was not sad, for he would shine on those"
19153,Antony and Cleopatra,23,1.5.64,CLEOPATRA,"That make their looks by his, he was not merry,"
19154,Antony and Cleopatra,23,1.5.65,CLEOPATRA,Which seem'd to tell them his remembrance lay
19155,Antony and Cleopatra,23,1.5.66,CLEOPATRA,"In Egypt with his joy, but between both:"
19156,Antony and Cleopatra,23,1.5.67,CLEOPATRA,"O heavenly mingle! Be'st thou sad or merry,"
19157,Antony and Cleopatra,23,1.5.68,CLEOPATRA,"The violence of either thee becomes,"
19158,Antony and Cleopatra,23,1.5.69,CLEOPATRA,So does it no man else. Met'st thou my posts?
19159,Antony and Cleopatra,24,1.5.70,ALEXAS,"Ay, madam, twenty several messengers:"
19160,Antony and Cleopatra,24,1.5.71,ALEXAS,Why do you send so thick?
19161,Antony and Cleopatra,25,1.5.72,CLEOPATRA,Who's born that day
19162,Antony and Cleopatra,25,1.5.73,CLEOPATRA,"When I forget to send to Antony,"
19163,Antony and Cleopatra,25,1.5.74,CLEOPATRA,"Shall die a beggar. Ink and paper, Charmian."
19164,Antony and Cleopatra,25,1.5.75,CLEOPATRA,"Welcome, my good Alexas. Did I, Charmian,"
19165,Antony and Cleopatra,25,1.5.76,CLEOPATRA,Ever love Caesar so?
19166,Antony and Cleopatra,26,1.5.77,CHARMIAN,O that brave Caesar!
19167,Antony and Cleopatra,27,1.5.78,CLEOPATRA,Be choked with such another emphasis!
19168,Antony and Cleopatra,27,1.5.79,CLEOPATRA,"Say, the brave Antony."
19169,Antony and Cleopatra,28,1.5.80,CHARMIAN,The valiant Caesar!
19170,Antony and Cleopatra,29,1.5.81,CLEOPATRA,"By Isis, I will give thee bloody teeth,"
19171,Antony and Cleopatra,29,1.5.82,CLEOPATRA,If thou with Caesar paragon again
19172,Antony and Cleopatra,29,1.5.83,CLEOPATRA,My man of men.
19173,Antony and Cleopatra,30,1.5.84,CHARMIAN,"By your most gracious pardon,"
19174,Antony and Cleopatra,30,1.5.85,CHARMIAN,I sing but after you.
19175,Antony and Cleopatra,31,1.5.86,CLEOPATRA,"My salad days,"
19176,Antony and Cleopatra,31,1.5.87,CLEOPATRA,"When I was green in judgment: cold in blood,"
19177,Antony and Cleopatra,31,1.5.88,CLEOPATRA,"To say as I said then! But, come, away,"
19178,Antony and Cleopatra,31,1.5.89,CLEOPATRA,Get me ink and paper:
19179,Antony and Cleopatra,31,1.5.90,CLEOPATRA,"He shall have every day a several greeting,"
19180,Antony and Cleopatra,31,1.5.91,CLEOPATRA,Or I'll unpeople Egypt.
19181,Antony and Cleopatra,31,,CLEOPATRA,Exeunt
19182,Antony and Cleopatra,31,,CLEOPATRA,ACT II
19183,Antony and Cleopatra,31,,CLEOPATRA,SCENE I. Messina. POMPEY's house.
19184,Antony and Cleopatra,31,,CLEOPATRA,"Enter POMPEY, MENECRATES, and MENAS, in warlike manner"
19185,Antony and Cleopatra,1,2.1.1,POMPEY,"If the great gods be just, they shall assist"
19186,Antony and Cleopatra,1,2.1.2,POMPEY,The deeds of justest men.
19187,Antony and Cleopatra,2,2.1.3,MENECRATES,"Know, worthy Pompey,"
19188,Antony and Cleopatra,2,2.1.4,MENECRATES,"That what they do delay, they not deny."
19189,Antony and Cleopatra,3,2.1.5,POMPEY,"Whiles we are suitors to their throne, decays"
19190,Antony and Cleopatra,3,2.1.6,POMPEY,The thing we sue for.
19191,Antony and Cleopatra,4,2.1.7,MENECRATES,"We, ignorant of ourselves,"
19192,Antony and Cleopatra,4,2.1.8,MENECRATES,"Beg often our own harms, which the wise powers"
19193,Antony and Cleopatra,4,2.1.9,MENECRATES,"Deny us for our good, so find we profit"
19194,Antony and Cleopatra,4,2.1.10,MENECRATES,By losing of our prayers.
19195,Antony and Cleopatra,5,2.1.11,POMPEY,I shall do well:
19196,Antony and Cleopatra,5,2.1.12,POMPEY,"The people love me, and the sea is mine,"
19197,Antony and Cleopatra,5,2.1.13,POMPEY,"My powers are crescent, and my auguring hope"
19198,Antony and Cleopatra,5,2.1.14,POMPEY,Says it will come to the full. Mark Antony
19199,Antony and Cleopatra,5,2.1.15,POMPEY,"In Egypt sits at dinner, and will make"
19200,Antony and Cleopatra,5,2.1.16,POMPEY,No wars without doors: Caesar gets money where
19201,Antony and Cleopatra,5,2.1.17,POMPEY,"He loses hearts: Lepidus flatters both,"
19202,Antony and Cleopatra,5,2.1.18,POMPEY,"Of both is flatter'd, but he neither loves,"
19203,Antony and Cleopatra,5,2.1.19,POMPEY,Nor either cares for him.
19204,Antony and Cleopatra,6,2.1.20,MENAS,Caesar and Lepidus
19205,Antony and Cleopatra,6,2.1.21,MENAS,Are in the field: a mighty strength they carry.
19206,Antony and Cleopatra,7,2.1.22,POMPEY,Where have you this? 'tis false.
19207,Antony and Cleopatra,8,2.1.23,MENAS,"From Silvius, sir."
19208,Antony and Cleopatra,9,2.1.24,POMPEY,"He dreams: I know they are in Rome together,"
19209,Antony and Cleopatra,9,2.1.25,POMPEY,"Looking for Antony. But all the charms of love,"
19210,Antony and Cleopatra,9,2.1.26,POMPEY,"Salt Cleopatra, soften thy waned lip!"
19211,Antony and Cleopatra,9,2.1.27,POMPEY,"Let witchcraft join with beauty, lust with both!"
19212,Antony and Cleopatra,9,2.1.28,POMPEY,"Tie up the libertine in a field of feasts,"
19213,Antony and Cleopatra,9,2.1.29,POMPEY,"Keep his brain fuming, Epicurean cooks"
19214,Antony and Cleopatra,9,2.1.30,POMPEY,"Sharpen with cloyless sauce his appetite,"
19215,Antony and Cleopatra,9,2.1.31,POMPEY,That sleep and feeding may prorogue his honour
19216,Antony and Cleopatra,9,2.1.32,POMPEY,Even till a Lethe'd dulness!
19217,Antony and Cleopatra,9,,POMPEY,Enter VARRIUS
19218,Antony and Cleopatra,9,2.1.33,POMPEY,"How now, Varrius!"
19219,Antony and Cleopatra,10,2.1.34,VARRIUS,This is most certain that I shall deliver:
19220,Antony and Cleopatra,10,2.1.35,VARRIUS,Mark Antony is every hour in Rome
19221,Antony and Cleopatra,10,2.1.36,VARRIUS,Expected: since he went from Egypt 'tis
19222,Antony and Cleopatra,10,2.1.37,VARRIUS,A space for further travel.
19223,Antony and Cleopatra,11,2.1.38,POMPEY,I could have given less matter
19224,Antony and Cleopatra,11,2.1.39,POMPEY,"A better ear. Menas, I did not think"
19225,Antony and Cleopatra,11,2.1.40,POMPEY,This amorous surfeiter would have donn'd his helm
19226,Antony and Cleopatra,11,2.1.41,POMPEY,For such a petty war: his soldiership
19227,Antony and Cleopatra,11,2.1.42,POMPEY,Is twice the other twain: but let us rear
19228,Antony and Cleopatra,11,2.1.43,POMPEY,"The higher our opinion, that our stirring"
19229,Antony and Cleopatra,11,2.1.44,POMPEY,Can from the lap of Egypt's widow pluck
19230,Antony and Cleopatra,11,2.1.45,POMPEY,The ne'er-lust-wearied Antony.
19231,Antony and Cleopatra,12,2.1.46,MENAS,I cannot hope
19232,Antony and Cleopatra,12,2.1.47,MENAS,Caesar and Antony shall well greet together:
19233,Antony and Cleopatra,12,2.1.48,MENAS,"His wife that's dead did trespasses to Caesar,"
19234,Antony and Cleopatra,12,2.1.49,MENAS,"His brother warr'd upon him, although, I think,"
19235,Antony and Cleopatra,12,2.1.50,MENAS,Not moved by Antony.
19236,Antony and Cleopatra,13,2.1.51,POMPEY,"I know not, Menas,"
19237,Antony and Cleopatra,13,2.1.52,POMPEY,How lesser enmities may give way to greater.
19238,Antony and Cleopatra,13,2.1.53,POMPEY,"Were't not that we stand up against them all,"
19239,Antony and Cleopatra,13,2.1.54,POMPEY,'Twere pregnant they should square between
19240,Antony and Cleopatra,13,2.1.55,POMPEY,"themselves,"
19241,Antony and Cleopatra,13,2.1.56,POMPEY,For they have entertained cause enough
19242,Antony and Cleopatra,13,2.1.57,POMPEY,To draw their swords: but how the fear of us
19243,Antony and Cleopatra,13,2.1.58,POMPEY,May cement their divisions and bind up
19244,Antony and Cleopatra,13,2.1.59,POMPEY,"The petty difference, we yet not know."
19245,Antony and Cleopatra,13,2.1.60,POMPEY,Be't as our gods will have't! It only stands
19246,Antony and Cleopatra,13,2.1.61,POMPEY,Our lives upon to use our strongest hands.
19247,Antony and Cleopatra,13,2.1.62,POMPEY,"Come, Menas."
19248,Antony and Cleopatra,13,,POMPEY,Exeunt
19249,Antony and Cleopatra,13,,POMPEY,SCENE II. Rome. The house of LEPIDUS.
19250,Antony and Cleopatra,13,,POMPEY,Enter DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS and LEPIDUS
19251,Antony and Cleopatra,1,2.2.1,LEPIDUS,"Good Enobarbus, 'tis a worthy deed,"
19252,Antony and Cleopatra,1,2.2.2,LEPIDUS,"And shall become you well, to entreat your captain"
19253,Antony and Cleopatra,1,2.2.3,LEPIDUS,To soft and gentle speech.
19254,Antony and Cleopatra,2,2.2.4,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,I shall entreat him
19255,Antony and Cleopatra,2,2.2.5,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"To answer like himself: if Caesar move him,"
19256,Antony and Cleopatra,2,2.2.6,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,Let Antony look over Caesar's head
19257,Antony and Cleopatra,2,2.2.7,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"And speak as loud as Mars. By Jupiter,"
19258,Antony and Cleopatra,2,2.2.8,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Were I the wearer of Antonius' beard,"
19259,Antony and Cleopatra,2,2.2.9,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,I would not shave't to-day.
19260,Antony and Cleopatra,3,2.2.10,LEPIDUS,'Tis not a time
19261,Antony and Cleopatra,3,2.2.11,LEPIDUS,For private stomaching.
19262,Antony and Cleopatra,4,2.2.12,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,Every time
19263,Antony and Cleopatra,4,2.2.13,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,Serves for the matter that is then born in't.
19264,Antony and Cleopatra,5,2.2.14,LEPIDUS,But small to greater matters must give way.
19265,Antony and Cleopatra,6,2.2.15,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,Not if the small come first.
19266,Antony and Cleopatra,7,2.2.16,LEPIDUS,Your speech is passion:
19267,Antony and Cleopatra,7,2.2.17,LEPIDUS,"But, pray you, stir no embers up. Here comes"
19268,Antony and Cleopatra,7,2.2.18,LEPIDUS,The noble Antony.
19269,Antony and Cleopatra,7,,LEPIDUS,Enter MARK ANTONY and VENTIDIUS
19270,Antony and Cleopatra,8,2.2.19,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"And yonder, Caesar."
19271,Antony and Cleopatra,8,,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, MECAENAS, and AGRIPPA"
19272,Antony and Cleopatra,9,2.2.20,MARK ANTONY,"If we compose well here, to Parthia:"
19273,Antony and Cleopatra,9,2.2.21,MARK ANTONY,"Hark, Ventidius."
19274,Antony and Cleopatra,10,2.2.22,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"I do not know,"
19275,Antony and Cleopatra,10,2.2.23,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Mecaenas, ask Agrippa."
19276,Antony and Cleopatra,11,2.2.24,LEPIDUS,"Noble friends,"
19277,Antony and Cleopatra,11,2.2.25,LEPIDUS,"That which combined us was most great, and let not"
19278,Antony and Cleopatra,11,2.2.26,LEPIDUS,"A leaner action rend us. What's amiss,"
19279,Antony and Cleopatra,11,2.2.27,LEPIDUS,May it be gently heard: when we debate
19280,Antony and Cleopatra,11,2.2.28,LEPIDUS,"Our trivial difference loud, we do commit"
19281,Antony and Cleopatra,11,2.2.29,LEPIDUS,"Murder in healing wounds: then, noble partners,"
19282,Antony and Cleopatra,11,2.2.30,LEPIDUS,"The rather, for I earnestly beseech,"
19283,Antony and Cleopatra,11,2.2.31,LEPIDUS,"Touch you the sourest points with sweetest terms,"
19284,Antony and Cleopatra,11,2.2.32,LEPIDUS,Nor curstness grow to the matter.
19285,Antony and Cleopatra,12,2.2.33,MARK ANTONY,'Tis spoken well.
19286,Antony and Cleopatra,12,2.2.34,MARK ANTONY,"Were we before our armies, and to fight."
19287,Antony and Cleopatra,12,2.2.35,MARK ANTONY,I should do thus.
19288,Antony and Cleopatra,12,,MARK ANTONY,Flourish
19289,Antony and Cleopatra,13,2.2.36,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,Welcome to Rome.
19290,Antony and Cleopatra,14,2.2.37,MARK ANTONY,Thank you.
19291,Antony and Cleopatra,15,2.2.38,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,Sit.
19292,Antony and Cleopatra,16,2.2.39,MARK ANTONY,"Sit, sir."
19293,Antony and Cleopatra,17,2.2.40,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Nay, then."
19294,Antony and Cleopatra,18,2.2.41,MARK ANTONY,"I learn, you take things ill which are not so,"
19295,Antony and Cleopatra,18,2.2.42,MARK ANTONY,"Or being, concern you not."
19296,Antony and Cleopatra,19,2.2.43,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"I must be laugh'd at,"
19297,Antony and Cleopatra,19,2.2.44,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"If, or for nothing or a little, I"
19298,Antony and Cleopatra,19,2.2.45,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Should say myself offended, and with you"
19299,Antony and Cleopatra,19,2.2.46,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Chiefly i' the world, more laugh'd at, that I should"
19300,Antony and Cleopatra,19,2.2.47,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Once name you derogately, when to sound your name"
19301,Antony and Cleopatra,19,2.2.48,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,It not concern'd me.
19302,Antony and Cleopatra,20,2.2.49,MARK ANTONY,"My being in Egypt, Caesar,"
19303,Antony and Cleopatra,20,2.2.50,MARK ANTONY,What was't to you?
19304,Antony and Cleopatra,21,2.2.51,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,No more than my residing here at Rome
19305,Antony and Cleopatra,21,2.2.52,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Might be to you in Egypt: yet, if you there"
19306,Antony and Cleopatra,21,2.2.53,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Did practise on my state, your being in Egypt"
19307,Antony and Cleopatra,21,2.2.54,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,Might be my question.
19308,Antony and Cleopatra,22,2.2.55,MARK ANTONY,"How intend you, practised?"
19309,Antony and Cleopatra,23,2.2.56,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,You may be pleased to catch at mine intent
19310,Antony and Cleopatra,23,2.2.57,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,By what did here befal me. Your wife and brother
19311,Antony and Cleopatra,23,2.2.58,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Made wars upon me, and their contestation"
19312,Antony and Cleopatra,23,2.2.59,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Was theme for you, you were the word of war."
19313,Antony and Cleopatra,24,2.2.60,MARK ANTONY,"You do mistake your business, my brother never"
19314,Antony and Cleopatra,24,2.2.61,MARK ANTONY,"Did urge me in his act: I did inquire it,"
19315,Antony and Cleopatra,24,2.2.62,MARK ANTONY,"And have my learning from some true reports,"
19316,Antony and Cleopatra,24,2.2.63,MARK ANTONY,That drew their swords with you. Did he not rather
19317,Antony and Cleopatra,24,2.2.64,MARK ANTONY,"Discredit my authority with yours,"
19318,Antony and Cleopatra,24,2.2.65,MARK ANTONY,"And make the wars alike against my stomach,"
19319,Antony and Cleopatra,24,2.2.66,MARK ANTONY,Having alike your cause? Of this my letters
19320,Antony and Cleopatra,24,2.2.67,MARK ANTONY,"Before did satisfy you. If you'll patch a quarrel,"
19321,Antony and Cleopatra,24,2.2.68,MARK ANTONY,"As matter whole you have not to make it with,"
19322,Antony and Cleopatra,24,2.2.69,MARK ANTONY,It must not be with this.
19323,Antony and Cleopatra,25,2.2.70,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,You praise yourself
19324,Antony and Cleopatra,25,2.2.71,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"By laying defects of judgment to me, but"
19325,Antony and Cleopatra,25,2.2.72,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,You patch'd up your excuses.
19326,Antony and Cleopatra,26,2.2.73,MARK ANTONY,"Not so, not so,"
19327,Antony and Cleopatra,26,2.2.74,MARK ANTONY,"I know you could not lack, I am certain on't,"
19328,Antony and Cleopatra,26,2.2.75,MARK ANTONY,"Very necessity of this thought, that I,"
19329,Antony and Cleopatra,26,2.2.76,MARK ANTONY,"Your partner in the cause 'gainst which he fought,"
19330,Antony and Cleopatra,26,2.2.77,MARK ANTONY,Could not with graceful eyes attend those wars
19331,Antony and Cleopatra,26,2.2.78,MARK ANTONY,"Which fronted mine own peace. As for my wife,"
19332,Antony and Cleopatra,26,2.2.79,MARK ANTONY,I would you had her spirit in such another:
19333,Antony and Cleopatra,26,2.2.80,MARK ANTONY,"The third o' the world is yours, which with a snaffle"
19334,Antony and Cleopatra,26,2.2.81,MARK ANTONY,"You may pace easy, but not such a wife."
19335,Antony and Cleopatra,27,2.2.82,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Would we had all such wives, that the men might go"
19336,Antony and Cleopatra,27,2.2.83,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,to wars with the women!
19337,Antony and Cleopatra,28,2.2.84,MARK ANTONY,"So much uncurbable, her garboils, Caesar"
19338,Antony and Cleopatra,28,2.2.85,MARK ANTONY,"Made out of her impatience, which not wanted"
19339,Antony and Cleopatra,28,2.2.86,MARK ANTONY,"Shrewdness of policy too, I grieving grant"
19340,Antony and Cleopatra,28,2.2.87,MARK ANTONY,Did you too much disquiet: for that you must
19341,Antony and Cleopatra,28,2.2.88,MARK ANTONY,"But say, I could not help it."
19342,Antony and Cleopatra,29,2.2.89,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,I wrote to you
19343,Antony and Cleopatra,29,2.2.90,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"When rioting in Alexandria, you"
19344,Antony and Cleopatra,29,2.2.91,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Did pocket up my letters, and with taunts"
19345,Antony and Cleopatra,29,2.2.92,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,Did gibe my missive out of audience.
19346,Antony and Cleopatra,30,2.2.93,MARK ANTONY,"Sir,"
19347,Antony and Cleopatra,30,2.2.94,MARK ANTONY,He fell upon me ere admitted: then
19348,Antony and Cleopatra,30,2.2.95,MARK ANTONY,"Three kings I had newly feasted, and did want"
19349,Antony and Cleopatra,30,2.2.96,MARK ANTONY,Of what I was i' the morning: but next day
19350,Antony and Cleopatra,30,2.2.97,MARK ANTONY,"I told him of myself, which was as much"
19351,Antony and Cleopatra,30,2.2.98,MARK ANTONY,As to have ask'd him pardon. Let this fellow
19352,Antony and Cleopatra,30,2.2.99,MARK ANTONY,"Be nothing of our strife, if we contend,"
19353,Antony and Cleopatra,30,2.2.100,MARK ANTONY,Out of our question wipe him.
19354,Antony and Cleopatra,31,2.2.101,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,You have broken
19355,Antony and Cleopatra,31,2.2.102,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"The article of your oath, which you shall never"
19356,Antony and Cleopatra,31,2.2.103,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,Have tongue to charge me with.
19357,Antony and Cleopatra,32,2.2.104,LEPIDUS,"Soft, Caesar!"
19358,Antony and Cleopatra,33,2.2.105,MARK ANTONY,"No,"
19359,Antony and Cleopatra,33,2.2.106,MARK ANTONY,"Lepidus, let him speak:"
19360,Antony and Cleopatra,33,2.2.107,MARK ANTONY,"The honour is sacred which he talks on now,"
19361,Antony and Cleopatra,33,2.2.108,MARK ANTONY,"Supposing that I lack'd it. But, on, Caesar,"
19362,Antony and Cleopatra,33,2.2.109,MARK ANTONY,The article of my oath.
19363,Antony and Cleopatra,34,2.2.110,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"To lend me arms and aid when I required them,"
19364,Antony and Cleopatra,34,2.2.111,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,The which you both denied.
19365,Antony and Cleopatra,35,2.2.112,MARK ANTONY,"Neglected, rather,"
19366,Antony and Cleopatra,35,2.2.113,MARK ANTONY,And then when poison'd hours had bound me up
19367,Antony and Cleopatra,35,2.2.114,MARK ANTONY,"From mine own knowledge. As nearly as I may,"
19368,Antony and Cleopatra,35,2.2.115,MARK ANTONY,I'll play the penitent to you: but mine honesty
19369,Antony and Cleopatra,35,2.2.116,MARK ANTONY,"Shall not make poor my greatness, nor my power"
19370,Antony and Cleopatra,35,2.2.117,MARK ANTONY,"Work without it. Truth is, that Fulvia,"
19371,Antony and Cleopatra,35,2.2.118,MARK ANTONY,"To have me out of Egypt, made wars here,"
19372,Antony and Cleopatra,35,2.2.119,MARK ANTONY,"For which myself, the ignorant motive, do"
19373,Antony and Cleopatra,35,2.2.120,MARK ANTONY,So far ask pardon as befits mine honour
19374,Antony and Cleopatra,35,2.2.121,MARK ANTONY,To stoop in such a case.
19375,Antony and Cleopatra,36,2.2.122,LEPIDUS,'Tis noble spoken.
19376,Antony and Cleopatra,37,2.2.123,MECAENAS,"If it might please you, to enforce no further"
19377,Antony and Cleopatra,37,2.2.124,MECAENAS,The griefs between ye: to forget them quite
19378,Antony and Cleopatra,37,2.2.125,MECAENAS,Were to remember that the present need
19379,Antony and Cleopatra,37,2.2.126,MECAENAS,Speaks to atone you.
19380,Antony and Cleopatra,38,2.2.127,LEPIDUS,"Worthily spoken, Mecaenas."
19381,Antony and Cleopatra,39,2.2.128,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Or, if you borrow one another's love for the"
19382,Antony and Cleopatra,39,2.2.129,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"instant, you may, when you hear no more words of"
19383,Antony and Cleopatra,39,2.2.130,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Pompey, return it again: you shall have time to"
19384,Antony and Cleopatra,39,2.2.131,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,wrangle in when you have nothing else to do.
19385,Antony and Cleopatra,40,2.2.132,MARK ANTONY,Thou art a soldier only: speak no more.
19386,Antony and Cleopatra,41,2.2.133,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,That truth should be silent I had almost forgot.
19387,Antony and Cleopatra,42,2.2.134,MARK ANTONY,"You wrong this presence, therefore speak no more."
19388,Antony and Cleopatra,43,2.2.135,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Go to, then, your considerate stone."
19389,Antony and Cleopatra,44,2.2.136,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"I do not much dislike the matter, but"
19390,Antony and Cleopatra,44,2.2.137,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"The manner of his speech, for't cannot be"
19391,Antony and Cleopatra,44,2.2.138,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"We shall remain in friendship, our conditions"
19392,Antony and Cleopatra,44,2.2.139,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,So differing in their acts. Yet if I knew
19393,Antony and Cleopatra,44,2.2.140,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"What hoop should hold us stanch, from edge to edge"
19394,Antony and Cleopatra,44,2.2.141,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,O' the world I would pursue it.
19395,Antony and Cleopatra,45,2.2.142,AGRIPPA,"Give me leave, Caesar,--"
19396,Antony and Cleopatra,46,2.2.143,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Speak, Agrippa."
19397,Antony and Cleopatra,47,2.2.144,AGRIPPA,"Thou hast a sister by the mother's side,"
19398,Antony and Cleopatra,47,2.2.145,AGRIPPA,Admired Octavia: great Mark Antony
19399,Antony and Cleopatra,47,2.2.146,AGRIPPA,Is now a widower.
19400,Antony and Cleopatra,48,2.2.147,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Say not so, Agrippa:"
19401,Antony and Cleopatra,48,2.2.148,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"If Cleopatra heard you, your reproof"
19402,Antony and Cleopatra,48,2.2.149,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,Were well deserved of rashness.
19403,Antony and Cleopatra,49,2.2.150,MARK ANTONY,"I am not married, Caesar: let me hear"
19404,Antony and Cleopatra,49,2.2.151,MARK ANTONY,Agrippa further speak.
19405,Antony and Cleopatra,50,2.2.152,AGRIPPA,"To hold you in perpetual amity,"
19406,Antony and Cleopatra,50,2.2.153,AGRIPPA,"To make you brothers, and to knit your hearts"
19407,Antony and Cleopatra,50,2.2.154,AGRIPPA,"With an unslipping  knot, take Antony"
19408,Antony and Cleopatra,50,2.2.155,AGRIPPA,"Octavia to his wife, whose beauty claims"
19409,Antony and Cleopatra,50,2.2.156,AGRIPPA,"No worse a husband than the best of men,"
19410,Antony and Cleopatra,50,2.2.157,AGRIPPA,Whose virtue and whose general graces speak
19411,Antony and Cleopatra,50,2.2.158,AGRIPPA,"That which none else can utter. By this marriage,"
19412,Antony and Cleopatra,50,2.2.159,AGRIPPA,"All little jealousies, which now seem great,"
19413,Antony and Cleopatra,50,2.2.160,AGRIPPA,"And all great fears, which now import their dangers,"
19414,Antony and Cleopatra,50,2.2.161,AGRIPPA,"Would then be nothing: truths would be tales,"
19415,Antony and Cleopatra,50,2.2.162,AGRIPPA,Where now half tales be truths: her love to both
19416,Antony and Cleopatra,50,2.2.163,AGRIPPA,"Would, each to other and all loves to both,"
19417,Antony and Cleopatra,50,2.2.164,AGRIPPA,"Draw after her. Pardon what I have spoke,"
19418,Antony and Cleopatra,50,2.2.165,AGRIPPA,"For 'tis a studied, not a present thought,"
19419,Antony and Cleopatra,50,2.2.166,AGRIPPA,By duty ruminated.
19420,Antony and Cleopatra,51,2.2.167,MARK ANTONY,Will Caesar speak?
19421,Antony and Cleopatra,52,2.2.168,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,Not till he hears how Antony is touch'd
19422,Antony and Cleopatra,52,2.2.169,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,With what is spoke already.
19423,Antony and Cleopatra,53,2.2.170,MARK ANTONY,"What power is in Agrippa,"
19424,Antony and Cleopatra,53,2.2.171,MARK ANTONY,"If I would say, 'Agrippa, be it so,'"
19425,Antony and Cleopatra,53,2.2.172,MARK ANTONY,To make this good?
19426,Antony and Cleopatra,54,2.2.173,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"The power of Caesar, and"
19427,Antony and Cleopatra,54,2.2.174,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,His power unto Octavia.
19428,Antony and Cleopatra,55,2.2.175,MARK ANTONY,May I never
19429,Antony and Cleopatra,55,2.2.176,MARK ANTONY,"To this good purpose, that so fairly shows,"
19430,Antony and Cleopatra,55,2.2.177,MARK ANTONY,Dream of impediment! Let me have thy hand:
19431,Antony and Cleopatra,55,2.2.178,MARK ANTONY,Further this act of grace: and from this hour
19432,Antony and Cleopatra,55,2.2.179,MARK ANTONY,The heart of brothers govern in our loves
19433,Antony and Cleopatra,55,2.2.180,MARK ANTONY,And sway our great designs!
19434,Antony and Cleopatra,56,2.2.181,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,There is my hand.
19435,Antony and Cleopatra,56,2.2.182,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"A sister I bequeath you, whom no brother"
19436,Antony and Cleopatra,56,2.2.183,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,Did ever love so dearly: let her live
19437,Antony and Cleopatra,56,2.2.184,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"To join our kingdoms and our hearts, and never"
19438,Antony and Cleopatra,56,2.2.185,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,Fly off our loves again!
19439,Antony and Cleopatra,57,2.2.186,LEPIDUS,"Happily, amen!"
19440,Antony and Cleopatra,58,2.2.187,MARK ANTONY,"I did not think to draw my sword 'gainst Pompey,"
19441,Antony and Cleopatra,58,2.2.188,MARK ANTONY,For he hath laid strange courtesies and great
19442,Antony and Cleopatra,58,2.2.189,MARK ANTONY,"Of late upon me: I must thank him only,"
19443,Antony and Cleopatra,58,2.2.190,MARK ANTONY,"Lest my remembrance suffer ill report,"
19444,Antony and Cleopatra,58,2.2.191,MARK ANTONY,"At heel of that, defy him."
19445,Antony and Cleopatra,59,2.2.192,LEPIDUS,Time calls upon's:
19446,Antony and Cleopatra,59,2.2.193,LEPIDUS,"Of us must Pompey presently be sought,"
19447,Antony and Cleopatra,59,2.2.194,LEPIDUS,Or else he seeks out us.
19448,Antony and Cleopatra,60,2.2.195,MARK ANTONY,Where lies he?
19449,Antony and Cleopatra,61,2.2.196,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,About the mount Misenum.
19450,Antony and Cleopatra,62,2.2.197,MARK ANTONY,What is his strength by land?
19451,Antony and Cleopatra,63,2.2.198,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,Great and increasing: but by sea
19452,Antony and Cleopatra,63,2.2.199,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,He is an absolute master.
19453,Antony and Cleopatra,64,2.2.200,MARK ANTONY,So is the fame.
19454,Antony and Cleopatra,64,2.2.201,MARK ANTONY,Would we had spoke together! Haste we for it:
19455,Antony and Cleopatra,64,2.2.202,MARK ANTONY,"Yet, ere we put ourselves in arms, dispatch we"
19456,Antony and Cleopatra,64,2.2.203,MARK ANTONY,The business we have talk'd of.
19457,Antony and Cleopatra,65,2.2.204,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,With most gladness:
19458,Antony and Cleopatra,65,2.2.205,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"And do invite you to my sister's view,"
19459,Antony and Cleopatra,65,2.2.206,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,Whither straight I'll lead you.
19460,Antony and Cleopatra,66,2.2.207,MARK ANTONY,"Let us, Lepidus,"
19461,Antony and Cleopatra,66,2.2.208,MARK ANTONY,Not lack your company.
19462,Antony and Cleopatra,67,2.2.209,LEPIDUS,"Noble Antony,"
19463,Antony and Cleopatra,67,2.2.210,LEPIDUS,Not sickness should detain me.
19464,Antony and Cleopatra,67,,LEPIDUS,"Flourish. Exeunt OCTAVIUS CAESAR, MARK ANTONY, and LEPIDUS"
19465,Antony and Cleopatra,68,2.2.211,MECAENAS,"Welcome from Egypt, sir."
19466,Antony and Cleopatra,69,2.2.212,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Half the heart of Caesar, worthy Mecaenas! My"
19467,Antony and Cleopatra,69,2.2.213,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"honourable friend, Agrippa!"
19468,Antony and Cleopatra,70,2.2.214,AGRIPPA,Good Enobarbus!
19469,Antony and Cleopatra,71,2.2.215,MECAENAS,We have cause to be glad that matters are so well
19470,Antony and Cleopatra,71,2.2.216,MECAENAS,digested. You stayed well by 't in Egypt.
19471,Antony and Cleopatra,72,2.2.217,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Ay, sir, we did sleep day out of countenance, and"
19472,Antony and Cleopatra,72,2.2.218,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,made the night light with drinking.
19473,Antony and Cleopatra,73,2.2.219,MECAENAS,"Eight wild-boars roasted whole at a breakfast, and"
19474,Antony and Cleopatra,73,2.2.220,MECAENAS,"but twelve persons there, is this true?"
19475,Antony and Cleopatra,74,2.2.221,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,This was but as a fly by an eagle: we had much more
19476,Antony and Cleopatra,74,2.2.222,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"monstrous matter of feast, which worthily deserved noting."
19477,Antony and Cleopatra,75,2.2.223,MECAENAS,"She's a most triumphant lady, if report be square to"
19478,Antony and Cleopatra,75,2.2.224,MECAENAS,her.
19479,Antony and Cleopatra,76,2.2.225,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"When she first met Mark Antony, she pursed up"
19480,Antony and Cleopatra,76,2.2.226,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"his heart, upon the river of Cydnus."
19481,Antony and Cleopatra,77,2.2.227,AGRIPPA,"There she appeared indeed, or my reporter devised"
19482,Antony and Cleopatra,77,2.2.228,AGRIPPA,well for her.
19483,Antony and Cleopatra,78,2.2.229,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,I will tell you.
19484,Antony and Cleopatra,78,2.2.230,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"The barge she sat in, like a burnish'd throne,"
19485,Antony and Cleopatra,78,2.2.231,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Burn'd on the water: the poop was beaten gold,"
19486,Antony and Cleopatra,78,2.2.232,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Purple the sails, and so perfumed that"
19487,Antony and Cleopatra,78,2.2.233,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"The winds were love-sick with them, the oars were silver,"
19488,Antony and Cleopatra,78,2.2.234,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Which to the tune of flutes kept stroke, and made"
19489,Antony and Cleopatra,78,2.2.235,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"The water which they beat to follow faster,"
19490,Antony and Cleopatra,78,2.2.236,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"As amorous of their strokes. For her own person,"
19491,Antony and Cleopatra,78,2.2.237,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,It beggar'd all description: she did lie
19492,Antony and Cleopatra,78,2.2.238,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,In her pavilion--cloth-of-gold of tissue--
19493,Antony and Cleopatra,78,2.2.239,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,O'er-picturing that Venus where we see
19494,Antony and Cleopatra,78,2.2.240,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,The fancy outwork nature: on each side her
19495,Antony and Cleopatra,78,2.2.241,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Stood pretty dimpled boys, like smiling Cupids,"
19496,Antony and Cleopatra,78,2.2.242,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"With divers-colour'd fans, whose wind did seem"
19497,Antony and Cleopatra,78,2.2.243,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"To glow the delicate cheeks which they did cool,"
19498,Antony and Cleopatra,78,2.2.244,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,And what they undid did.
19499,Antony and Cleopatra,79,2.2.245,AGRIPPA,"O, rare for Antony!"
19500,Antony and Cleopatra,80,2.2.246,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Her gentlewomen, like the Nereides,"
19501,Antony and Cleopatra,80,2.2.247,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"So many mermaids, tended her i' the eyes,"
19502,Antony and Cleopatra,80,2.2.248,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,And made their bends adornings: at the helm
19503,Antony and Cleopatra,80,2.2.249,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,A seeming mermaid steers: the silken tackle
19504,Antony and Cleopatra,80,2.2.250,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Swell with the touches of those flower-soft hands,"
19505,Antony and Cleopatra,80,2.2.251,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,That yarely frame the office. From the barge
19506,Antony and Cleopatra,80,2.2.252,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,A strange invisible perfume hits the sense
19507,Antony and Cleopatra,80,2.2.253,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,Of the adjacent wharfs. The city cast
19508,Antony and Cleopatra,80,2.2.254,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Her people out upon her, and Antony,"
19509,Antony and Cleopatra,80,2.2.255,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Enthroned i' the market-place, did sit alone,"
19510,Antony and Cleopatra,80,2.2.256,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Whistling to the air, which, but for vacancy,"
19511,Antony and Cleopatra,80,2.2.257,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Had gone to gaze on Cleopatra too,"
19512,Antony and Cleopatra,80,2.2.258,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,And made a gap in nature.
19513,Antony and Cleopatra,81,2.2.259,AGRIPPA,Rare Egyptian!
19514,Antony and Cleopatra,82,2.2.260,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Upon her landing, Antony sent to her,"
19515,Antony and Cleopatra,82,2.2.261,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Invited her to supper: she replied,"
19516,Antony and Cleopatra,82,2.2.262,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"It should be better he became her guest,"
19517,Antony and Cleopatra,82,2.2.263,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Which she entreated: our courteous Antony,"
19518,Antony and Cleopatra,82,2.2.264,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Whom ne'er the word of 'No' woman heard speak,"
19519,Antony and Cleopatra,82,2.2.265,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Being barber'd ten times o'er, goes to the feast,"
19520,Antony and Cleopatra,82,2.2.266,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,And for his ordinary pays his heart
19521,Antony and Cleopatra,82,2.2.267,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,For what his eyes eat only.
19522,Antony and Cleopatra,83,2.2.268,AGRIPPA,Royal wench!
19523,Antony and Cleopatra,83,2.2.269,AGRIPPA,She made great Caesar lay his sword to bed:
19524,Antony and Cleopatra,83,2.2.270,AGRIPPA,"He plough'd her, and she cropp'd."
19525,Antony and Cleopatra,84,2.2.271,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,I saw her once
19526,Antony and Cleopatra,84,2.2.272,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Hop forty paces through the public street,"
19527,Antony and Cleopatra,84,2.2.273,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"And having lost her breath, she spoke, and panted,"
19528,Antony and Cleopatra,84,2.2.274,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"That she did make defect perfection,"
19529,Antony and Cleopatra,84,2.2.275,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"And, breathless, power breathe forth."
19530,Antony and Cleopatra,85,2.2.276,MECAENAS,Now Antony must leave her utterly.
19531,Antony and Cleopatra,86,2.2.277,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Never, he will not:"
19532,Antony and Cleopatra,86,2.2.278,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Age cannot wither her, nor custom stale"
19533,Antony and Cleopatra,86,2.2.279,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,Her infinite variety: other women cloy
19534,Antony and Cleopatra,86,2.2.280,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,The appetites they feed: but she makes hungry
19535,Antony and Cleopatra,86,2.2.281,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Where most she satisfies, for vilest things"
19536,Antony and Cleopatra,86,2.2.282,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,Become themselves in her: that the holy priests
19537,Antony and Cleopatra,86,2.2.283,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,Bless her when she is riggish.
19538,Antony and Cleopatra,87,2.2.284,MECAENAS,"If beauty, wisdom, modesty, can settle"
19539,Antony and Cleopatra,87,2.2.285,MECAENAS,"The heart of Antony, Octavia is"
19540,Antony and Cleopatra,87,2.2.286,MECAENAS,A blessed lottery to him.
19541,Antony and Cleopatra,88,2.2.287,AGRIPPA,Let us go.
19542,Antony and Cleopatra,88,2.2.288,AGRIPPA,"Good Enobarbus, make yourself my guest"
19543,Antony and Cleopatra,88,2.2.289,AGRIPPA,Whilst you abide here.
19544,Antony and Cleopatra,89,2.2.290,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Humbly, sir, I thank you."
19545,Antony and Cleopatra,89,,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,Exeunt
19546,Antony and Cleopatra,89,,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,SCENE III. The same. OCTAVIUS CAESAR's house.
19547,Antony and Cleopatra,89,,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Enter MARK ANTONY, OCTAVIUS CAESAR, OCTAVIA between them, and Attendants"
19548,Antony and Cleopatra,1,2.3.1,MARK ANTONY,The world and my great office will sometimes
19549,Antony and Cleopatra,1,2.3.2,MARK ANTONY,Divide me from your bosom.
19550,Antony and Cleopatra,2,2.3.3,OCTAVIA,All which time
19551,Antony and Cleopatra,2,2.3.4,OCTAVIA,Before the gods my knee shall bow my prayers

19779,Antony and Cleopatra,56,,CLEOPATRA,SCENE VI. Near Misenum.
19780,Antony and Cleopatra,56,,CLEOPATRA,"Flourish. Enter POMPEY and MENAS at one door,  with drum and trumpet: at another, OCTAVIUS CAESAR,  MARK ANTONY, LEPIDUS, DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS, MECAENAS, with Soldiers marching"
19781,Antony and Cleopatra,1,2.6.1,POMPEY,"Your hostages I have, so have you mine,"
19782,Antony and Cleopatra,1,2.6.2,POMPEY,And we shall talk before we fight.
19783,Antony and Cleopatra,2,2.6.3,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,Most meet
19784,Antony and Cleopatra,2,2.6.4,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"That first we come to words, and therefore have we"
19785,Antony and Cleopatra,2,2.6.5,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Our written purposes before us sent,"
19786,Antony and Cleopatra,2,2.6.6,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Which, if thou hast consider'd, let us know"
19787,Antony and Cleopatra,2,2.6.7,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"If 'twill tie up thy discontented sword,"
19788,Antony and Cleopatra,2,2.6.8,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,And carry back to Sicily much tall youth
19789,Antony and Cleopatra,2,2.6.9,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,That else must perish here.
19790,Antony and Cleopatra,3,2.6.10,POMPEY,"To you all three,"
19791,Antony and Cleopatra,3,2.6.11,POMPEY,"The senators alone of this great world,"
19792,Antony and Cleopatra,3,2.6.12,POMPEY,"Chief factors for the gods, I do not know"
19793,Antony and Cleopatra,3,2.6.13,POMPEY,"Wherefore my father should revengers want,"
19794,Antony and Cleopatra,3,2.6.14,POMPEY,"Having a son and friends, since Julius Caesar,"
19795,Antony and Cleopatra,3,2.6.15,POMPEY,"Who at Philippi the good Brutus ghosted,"
19796,Antony and Cleopatra,3,2.6.16,POMPEY,There saw you labouring for him. What was't
19797,Antony and Cleopatra,3,2.6.17,POMPEY,"That moved pale Cassius to conspire, and what"
19798,Antony and Cleopatra,3,2.6.18,POMPEY,"Made the all-honour'd, honest Roman, Brutus,"
19799,Antony and Cleopatra,3,2.6.19,POMPEY,"With the arm'd rest, courtiers and beauteous freedom,"
19800,Antony and Cleopatra,3,2.6.20,POMPEY,"To drench the Capitol, but that they would"
19801,Antony and Cleopatra,3,2.6.21,POMPEY,Have one man but a man? And that is it
19802,Antony and Cleopatra,3,2.6.22,POMPEY,"Hath made me rig my navy, at whose burthen"
19803,Antony and Cleopatra,3,2.6.23,POMPEY,"The anger'd ocean foams, with which I meant"
19804,Antony and Cleopatra,3,2.6.24,POMPEY,To scourge the ingratitude that despiteful Rome
19805,Antony and Cleopatra,3,2.6.25,POMPEY,Cast on my noble father.
19806,Antony and Cleopatra,4,2.6.26,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,Take your time.
19807,Antony and Cleopatra,5,2.6.27,MARK ANTONY,"Thou canst not fear us, Pompey, with thy sails,"
19808,Antony and Cleopatra,5,2.6.28,MARK ANTONY,"We'll speak with thee at sea: at land, thou know'st"
19809,Antony and Cleopatra,5,2.6.29,MARK ANTONY,How much we do o'er-count thee.
19810,Antony and Cleopatra,6,2.6.30,POMPEY,"At land, indeed,"
19811,Antony and Cleopatra,6,2.6.31,POMPEY,Thou dost o'er-count me of my father's house:
19812,Antony and Cleopatra,6,2.6.32,POMPEY,"But, since the cuckoo builds not for himself,"
19813,Antony and Cleopatra,6,2.6.33,POMPEY,Remain in't as thou mayst.
19814,Antony and Cleopatra,7,2.6.34,LEPIDUS,Be pleased to tell us--
19815,Antony and Cleopatra,7,2.6.35,LEPIDUS,For this is from the present--how you take
19816,Antony and Cleopatra,7,2.6.36,LEPIDUS,The offers we have sent you.
19817,Antony and Cleopatra,8,2.6.37,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,There's the point.
19818,Antony and Cleopatra,9,2.6.38,MARK ANTONY,"Which do not be entreated to, but weigh"
19819,Antony and Cleopatra,9,2.6.39,MARK ANTONY,What it is worth embraced.
19820,Antony and Cleopatra,10,2.6.40,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"And what may follow,"
19821,Antony and Cleopatra,10,2.6.41,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,To try a larger fortune.
19822,Antony and Cleopatra,11,2.6.42,POMPEY,You have made me offer
19823,Antony and Cleopatra,11,2.6.43,POMPEY,"Of Sicily, Sardinia, and I must"
19824,Antony and Cleopatra,11,2.6.44,POMPEY,"Rid all the sea of pirates, then, to send"
19825,Antony and Cleopatra,11,2.6.45,POMPEY,"Measures of wheat to Rome, this 'greed upon"
19826,Antony and Cleopatra,11,2.6.46,POMPEY,"To part with unhack'd edges, and bear back"
19827,Antony and Cleopatra,11,2.6.47,POMPEY,Our targes undinted.
19828,Antony and Cleopatra,14,2.6.48,LEPIDUS,That's our offer.
19829,Antony and Cleopatra,15,2.6.49,POMPEY,"Know, then,"
19830,Antony and Cleopatra,15,2.6.50,POMPEY,I came before you here a man prepared
19831,Antony and Cleopatra,15,2.6.51,POMPEY,To take this offer: but Mark Antony
19832,Antony and Cleopatra,15,2.6.52,POMPEY,Put me to some impatience: though I lose
19833,Antony and Cleopatra,15,2.6.53,POMPEY,"The praise of it by telling, you must know,"
19834,Antony and Cleopatra,15,2.6.54,POMPEY,"When Caesar and your brother were at blows,"
19835,Antony and Cleopatra,15,2.6.55,POMPEY,Your mother came to Sicily and did find
19836,Antony and Cleopatra,15,2.6.56,POMPEY,Her welcome friendly.
19837,Antony and Cleopatra,16,2.6.57,MARK ANTONY,"I have heard it, Pompey,"
19838,Antony and Cleopatra,16,2.6.58,MARK ANTONY,And am well studied for a liberal thanks
19839,Antony and Cleopatra,16,2.6.59,MARK ANTONY,Which I do owe you.
19840,Antony and Cleopatra,17,2.6.60,POMPEY,Let me have your hand:
19841,Antony and Cleopatra,17,2.6.61,POMPEY,"I did not think, sir, to have met you here."
19842,Antony and Cleopatra,18,2.6.62,MARK ANTONY,"The beds i' the east are soft, and thanks to you,"
19843,Antony and Cleopatra,18,2.6.63,MARK ANTONY,"That call'd me timelier than my purpose hither,"
19844,Antony and Cleopatra,18,2.6.64,MARK ANTONY,For I have gain'd by 't.
19845,Antony and Cleopatra,19,2.6.65,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Since I saw you last,"
19846,Antony and Cleopatra,19,2.6.66,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,There is a change upon you.
19847,Antony and Cleopatra,20,2.6.67,POMPEY,"Well, I know not"
19848,Antony and Cleopatra,20,2.6.68,POMPEY,"What counts harsh fortune casts upon my face,"
19849,Antony and Cleopatra,20,2.6.69,POMPEY,"But in my bosom shall she never come,"
19850,Antony and Cleopatra,20,2.6.70,POMPEY,To make my heart her vassal.
19851,Antony and Cleopatra,21,2.6.71,LEPIDUS,Well met here.
19852,Antony and Cleopatra,22,2.6.72,POMPEY,"I hope so, Lepidus. Thus we are agreed:"
19853,Antony and Cleopatra,22,2.6.73,POMPEY,"I crave our composition may be written,"
19854,Antony and Cleopatra,22,2.6.74,POMPEY,And seal'd between us.
19855,Antony and Cleopatra,23,2.6.75,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,That's the next to do.
19856,Antony and Cleopatra,24,2.6.76,POMPEY,"We'll feast each other ere we part, and let's"
19857,Antony and Cleopatra,24,2.6.77,POMPEY,Draw lots who shall begin.
19858,Antony and Cleopatra,25,2.6.78,MARK ANTONY,"That will I, Pompey."
19859,Antony and Cleopatra,26,2.6.79,POMPEY,"No, Antony, take the lot: but, first"
19860,Antony and Cleopatra,26,2.6.80,POMPEY,"Or last, your fine Egyptian cookery"
19861,Antony and Cleopatra,26,2.6.81,POMPEY,Shall have the fame. I have heard that Julius Caesar
19862,Antony and Cleopatra,26,2.6.82,POMPEY,Grew fat with feasting there.
19863,Antony and Cleopatra,27,2.6.83,MARK ANTONY,You have heard much.
19864,Antony and Cleopatra,28,2.6.84,POMPEY,"I have fair meanings, sir."
19865,Antony and Cleopatra,29,2.6.85,MARK ANTONY,And fair words to them.
19866,Antony and Cleopatra,30,2.6.86,POMPEY,Then so much have I heard:
19867,Antony and Cleopatra,30,2.6.87,POMPEY,"And I have heard, Apollodorus carried--"
19868,Antony and Cleopatra,31,2.6.88,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,No more of that: he did so.
19869,Antony and Cleopatra,32,2.6.89,POMPEY,"What, I pray you?"
19870,Antony and Cleopatra,33,2.6.90,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,A certain queen to Caesar in a mattress.
19871,Antony and Cleopatra,34,2.6.91,POMPEY,"I know thee now: how farest thou, soldier?"
19872,Antony and Cleopatra,35,2.6.92,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Well,"
19873,Antony and Cleopatra,35,2.6.93,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"And well am like to do, for, I perceive,"
19874,Antony and Cleopatra,35,2.6.94,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,Four feasts are toward.
19875,Antony and Cleopatra,36,2.6.95,POMPEY,"Let me shake thy hand,"
19876,Antony and Cleopatra,36,2.6.96,POMPEY,"I never hated thee: I have seen thee fight,"
19877,Antony and Cleopatra,36,2.6.97,POMPEY,When I have envied thy behavior.
19878,Antony and Cleopatra,37,2.6.98,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Sir,"
19879,Antony and Cleopatra,37,2.6.99,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"I never loved you much, but I ha' praised ye,"
19880,Antony and Cleopatra,37,2.6.100,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,When you have well deserved ten times as much
19881,Antony and Cleopatra,37,2.6.101,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,As I have said you did.
19882,Antony and Cleopatra,38,2.6.102,POMPEY,"Enjoy thy plainness,"
19883,Antony and Cleopatra,38,2.6.103,POMPEY,It nothing ill becomes thee.
19884,Antony and Cleopatra,38,2.6.104,POMPEY,Aboard my galley I invite you all:
19885,Antony and Cleopatra,38,2.6.105,POMPEY,"Will you lead, lords?"
19886,Antony and Cleopatra,41,2.6.106,LEPIDUS,"Show us the way, sir."
19887,Antony and Cleopatra,42,2.6.107,POMPEY,Come.
19888,Antony and Cleopatra,42,,POMPEY,Exeunt all but MENAS and ENOBARBUS
19889,Antony and Cleopatra,43,2.6.108,MENAS,"[Aside]  Thy father, Pompey, would ne'er have"
19890,Antony and Cleopatra,43,2.6.109,MENAS,"made this treaty.--You and I have known, sir."
19891,Antony and Cleopatra,44,2.6.110,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"At sea, I think."
19892,Antony and Cleopatra,45,2.6.111,MENAS,"We have, sir."
19893,Antony and Cleopatra,46,2.6.112,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,You have done well by water.
19894,Antony and Cleopatra,47,2.6.113,MENAS,And you by land.
19895,Antony and Cleopatra,48,2.6.114,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"I will praise any man that will praise me, though it"
19896,Antony and Cleopatra,48,2.6.115,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,cannot be denied what I have done by land.
19897,Antony and Cleopatra,49,2.6.116,MENAS,Nor what I have done by water.
19898,Antony and Cleopatra,50,2.6.117,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Yes, something you can deny for your own"
19899,Antony and Cleopatra,50,2.6.118,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,safety: you have been a great thief by sea.
19900,Antony and Cleopatra,51,2.6.119,MENAS,And you by land.
19901,Antony and Cleopatra,52,2.6.120,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,There I deny my land service. But give me your
19902,Antony and Cleopatra,52,2.6.121,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"hand, Menas: if our eyes had authority, here they"
19903,Antony and Cleopatra,52,2.6.122,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,might take two thieves kissing.
19904,Antony and Cleopatra,53,2.6.123,MENAS,"All men's faces are true, whatsome'er their hands are."
19905,Antony and Cleopatra,54,2.6.124,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,But there is never a fair woman has a true face.
19906,Antony and Cleopatra,55,2.6.125,MENAS,"No slander, they steal hearts."
19907,Antony and Cleopatra,56,2.6.126,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,We came hither to fight with you.
19908,Antony and Cleopatra,57,2.6.127,MENAS,"For my part, I am sorry it is turned to a drinking."
19909,Antony and Cleopatra,57,2.6.128,MENAS,Pompey doth this day laugh away his fortune.
19910,Antony and Cleopatra,58,2.6.129,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"If he do, sure, he cannot weep't back again."
19911,Antony and Cleopatra,59,2.6.130,MENAS,"You've said, sir. We looked not for Mark Antony"
19912,Antony and Cleopatra,59,2.6.131,MENAS,"here: pray you, is he married to Cleopatra?"
19913,Antony and Cleopatra,60,2.6.132,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,Caesar's sister is called Octavia.
19914,Antony and Cleopatra,61,2.6.133,MENAS,"True, sir, she was the wife of Caius Marcellus."
19915,Antony and Cleopatra,62,2.6.134,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,But she is now the wife of Marcus Antonius.
19916,Antony and Cleopatra,63,2.6.135,MENAS,"Pray ye, sir?"
19917,Antony and Cleopatra,64,2.6.136,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,'Tis true.
19918,Antony and Cleopatra,65,2.6.137,MENAS,Then is Caesar and he for ever knit together.
19919,Antony and Cleopatra,66,2.6.138,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"If I were bound to divine of this unity, I would"
19920,Antony and Cleopatra,66,2.6.139,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,not prophesy so.
19921,Antony and Cleopatra,67,2.6.140,MENAS,I think the policy of that purpose made more in the
19922,Antony and Cleopatra,67,2.6.141,MENAS,marriage than the love of the parties.
19923,Antony and Cleopatra,68,2.6.142,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"I think so too. But you shall find, the band that"
19924,Antony and Cleopatra,68,2.6.143,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,seems to tie their friendship together will be the
19925,Antony and Cleopatra,68,2.6.144,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,very strangler of their amity: Octavia is of a
19926,Antony and Cleopatra,68,2.6.145,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"holy, cold, and still conversation."
19927,Antony and Cleopatra,69,2.6.146,MENAS,Who would not have his wife so?
19928,Antony and Cleopatra,70,2.6.147,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Not he that himself is not so, which is Mark Antony."
19929,Antony and Cleopatra,70,2.6.148,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,He will to his Egyptian dish again: then shall the
19930,Antony and Cleopatra,70,2.6.149,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"sighs of Octavia blow the fire up in Caesar, and, as"
19931,Antony and Cleopatra,70,2.6.150,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"I said before, that which is the strength of their"
19932,Antony and Cleopatra,70,2.6.151,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,amity shall prove the immediate author of their
19933,Antony and Cleopatra,70,2.6.152,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,variance. Antony will use his affection where it is:
19934,Antony and Cleopatra,70,2.6.153,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,he married but his occasion here.
19935,Antony and Cleopatra,71,2.6.154,MENAS,"And thus it may be. Come, sir, will you aboard?"
19936,Antony and Cleopatra,71,2.6.155,MENAS,I have a health for you.
19937,Antony and Cleopatra,72,2.6.156,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"I shall take it, sir: we have used our throats in Egypt."
19938,Antony and Cleopatra,73,2.6.157,MENAS,"Come, let's away."
19939,Antony and Cleopatra,73,,MENAS,Exeunt
19940,Antony and Cleopatra,73,,MENAS,"SCENE VII. On board POMPEY's galley, off Misenum."
19941,Antony and Cleopatra,73,,MENAS,Music plays. Enter two or three Servants with a banquet
19942,Antony and Cleopatra,1,2.7.1,First Servant,"Here they'll be, man. Some o' their plants are"
19943,Antony and Cleopatra,1,2.7.2,First Servant,ill-rooted already: the least wind i' the world
19944,Antony and Cleopatra,1,2.7.3,First Servant,will blow them down.
19945,Antony and Cleopatra,2,2.7.4,Second Servant,Lepidus is high-coloured.
19946,Antony and Cleopatra,3,2.7.5,First Servant,They have made him drink alms-drink.
19947,Antony and Cleopatra,4,2.7.6,Second Servant,"As they pinch one another by the disposition, he"
19948,Antony and Cleopatra,4,2.7.7,Second Servant,"cries out 'No more,' reconciles them to his"
19949,Antony and Cleopatra,4,2.7.8,Second Servant,"entreaty, and himself to the drink."
19950,Antony and Cleopatra,5,2.7.9,First Servant,But it raises the greater war between him and
19951,Antony and Cleopatra,5,2.7.10,First Servant,his discretion.
19952,Antony and Cleopatra,6,2.7.11,Second Servant,"Why, this is to have a name in great men's"
19953,Antony and Cleopatra,6,2.7.12,Second Servant,fellowship: I had as lief have a reed that will do
19954,Antony and Cleopatra,6,2.7.13,Second Servant,me no service as a partisan I could not heave.
19955,Antony and Cleopatra,7,2.7.14,First Servant,"To be called into a huge sphere, and not to be seen"
19956,Antony and Cleopatra,7,2.7.15,First Servant,"to move in't, are the holes where eyes should be,"
19957,Antony and Cleopatra,7,2.7.16,First Servant,which pitifully disaster the cheeks.
19958,Antony and Cleopatra,7,,First Servant,"A sennet sounded. Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, MARK  ANTONY, LEPIDUS, POMPEY, AGRIPPA, MECAENAS, DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS, MENAS, with other captains"
19959,Antony and Cleopatra,8,2.7.17,MARK ANTONY,"[To OCTAVIUS CAESAR]  Thus do they, sir: they take"
19960,Antony and Cleopatra,8,2.7.18,MARK ANTONY,the flow o' the Nile
19961,Antony and Cleopatra,8,2.7.19,MARK ANTONY,"By certain scales i' the pyramid, they know,"
19962,Antony and Cleopatra,8,2.7.20,MARK ANTONY,"By the height, the lowness, or the mean, if dearth"
19963,Antony and Cleopatra,8,2.7.21,MARK ANTONY,"Or foison follow: the higher Nilus swells,"
19964,Antony and Cleopatra,8,2.7.22,MARK ANTONY,"The more it promises: as it ebbs, the seedsman"
19965,Antony and Cleopatra,8,2.7.23,MARK ANTONY,"Upon the slime and ooze scatters his grain,"
19966,Antony and Cleopatra,8,2.7.24,MARK ANTONY,And shortly comes to harvest.
19967,Antony and Cleopatra,9,2.7.25,LEPIDUS,You've strange serpents there.
19968,Antony and Cleopatra,10,2.7.26,MARK ANTONY,"Ay, Lepidus."
19969,Antony and Cleopatra,11,2.7.27,LEPIDUS,Your serpent of Egypt is bred now of your mud by the
19970,Antony and Cleopatra,11,2.7.28,LEPIDUS,operation of your sun: so is your crocodile.
19971,Antony and Cleopatra,12,2.7.29,MARK ANTONY,They are so.
19972,Antony and Cleopatra,13,2.7.30,POMPEY,"Sit,--and some wine! A health to Lepidus!"
19973,Antony and Cleopatra,14,2.7.31,LEPIDUS,"I am not so well as I should be, but I'll ne'er out."
19974,Antony and Cleopatra,15,2.7.32,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Not till you have slept, I fear me you'll be in till then."
19975,Antony and Cleopatra,16,2.7.33,LEPIDUS,"Nay, certainly, I have heard the Ptolemies'"
19976,Antony and Cleopatra,16,2.7.34,LEPIDUS,"pyramises are very goodly things, without"
19977,Antony and Cleopatra,16,2.7.35,LEPIDUS,"contradiction, I have heard that."
19978,Antony and Cleopatra,17,2.7.36,MENAS,"[Aside to POMPEY]  Pompey, a word."
19979,Antony and Cleopatra,18,2.7.37,POMPEY,[Aside to MENAS]                 Say in mine ear:
19980,Antony and Cleopatra,18,2.7.38,POMPEY,what is't?
19981,Antony and Cleopatra,19,2.7.39,MENAS,"[Aside to POMPEY]  Forsake thy seat, I do beseech"
19982,Antony and Cleopatra,19,2.7.40,MENAS,"thee, captain,"
19983,Antony and Cleopatra,19,2.7.41,MENAS,And hear me speak a word.
19984,Antony and Cleopatra,20,2.7.42,POMPEY,[Aside to MENAS]  Forbear me till anon.
19985,Antony and Cleopatra,20,2.7.43,POMPEY,This wine for Lepidus!
19986,Antony and Cleopatra,21,2.7.44,LEPIDUS,What manner o' thing is your crocodile?
19987,Antony and Cleopatra,22,2.7.45,MARK ANTONY,"It is shaped, sir, like itself, and it is as broad"
19988,Antony and Cleopatra,22,2.7.46,MARK ANTONY,"as it hath breadth: it is just so high as it is,"
19989,Antony and Cleopatra,22,2.7.47,MARK ANTONY,and moves with its own organs: it lives by that
19990,Antony and Cleopatra,22,2.7.48,MARK ANTONY,"which nourisheth it, and the elements once out of"
19991,Antony and Cleopatra,22,2.7.49,MARK ANTONY,"it, it transmigrates."
19992,Antony and Cleopatra,23,2.7.50,LEPIDUS,What colour is it of?
19993,Antony and Cleopatra,24,2.7.51,MARK ANTONY,Of it own colour too.
19994,Antony and Cleopatra,25,2.7.52,LEPIDUS,'Tis a strange serpent.
19995,Antony and Cleopatra,26,2.7.53,MARK ANTONY,'Tis so. And the tears of it are wet.
19996,Antony and Cleopatra,27,2.7.54,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,Will this description satisfy him?
19997,Antony and Cleopatra,28,2.7.55,MARK ANTONY,"With the health that Pompey gives him, else he is a"
19998,Antony and Cleopatra,28,2.7.56,MARK ANTONY,very epicure.
19999,Antony and Cleopatra,29,2.7.57,POMPEY,"[Aside to MENAS]  Go hang, sir, hang! Tell me of"
20000,Antony and Cleopatra,29,2.7.58,POMPEY,that? away!
20001,Antony and Cleopatra,29,2.7.59,POMPEY,Do as I bid you. Where's this cup I call'd for?
20002,Antony and Cleopatra,30,2.7.60,MENAS,[Aside to POMPEY]  If for the sake of merit thou
20003,Antony and Cleopatra,30,2.7.61,MENAS,"wilt hear me,"
20004,Antony and Cleopatra,30,2.7.62,MENAS,Rise from thy stool.
20005,Antony and Cleopatra,31,2.7.63,POMPEY,[Aside to MENAS]  I think thou'rt mad.
20006,Antony and Cleopatra,31,2.7.64,POMPEY,The matter?
20007,Antony and Cleopatra,31,,POMPEY,"Rises, and walks aside"
20008,Antony and Cleopatra,32,2.7.65,MENAS,I have ever held my cap off to thy fortunes.
20009,Antony and Cleopatra,33,2.7.66,POMPEY,Thou hast served me with much faith. What's else to say?
20010,Antony and Cleopatra,33,2.7.67,POMPEY,"Be jolly, lords."
20011,Antony and Cleopatra,34,2.7.68,MARK ANTONY,"These quick-sands, Lepidus,"
20012,Antony and Cleopatra,34,2.7.69,MARK ANTONY,"Keep off them, for you sink."
20013,Antony and Cleopatra,35,2.7.70,MENAS,Wilt thou be lord of all the world?
20014,Antony and Cleopatra,36,2.7.71,POMPEY,What say'st thou?
20015,Antony and Cleopatra,37,2.7.72,MENAS,Wilt thou be lord of the whole world? That's twice.
20016,Antony and Cleopatra,38,2.7.73,POMPEY,How should that be?
20017,Antony and Cleopatra,39,2.7.74,MENAS,"But entertain it,"
20018,Antony and Cleopatra,39,2.7.75,MENAS,"And, though thou think me poor, I am the man"
20019,Antony and Cleopatra,39,2.7.76,MENAS,Will give thee all the world.
20020,Antony and Cleopatra,40,2.7.77,POMPEY,Hast thou drunk well?
20021,Antony and Cleopatra,41,2.7.78,MENAS,"Now, Pompey, I have kept me from the cup."
20022,Antony and Cleopatra,41,2.7.79,MENAS,"Thou art, if thou darest be, the earthly Jove:"

20024,Antony and Cleopatra,41,2.7.81,MENAS,"Is thine, if thou wilt ha't."
20025,Antony and Cleopatra,42,2.7.82,POMPEY,Show me which way.
20026,Antony and Cleopatra,43,2.7.83,MENAS,"These three world-sharers, these competitors,"
20027,Antony and Cleopatra,43,2.7.84,MENAS,"Are in thy vessel: let me cut the cable,"
20028,Antony and Cleopatra,43,2.7.85,MENAS,"And, when we are put off, fall to their throats:"
20029,Antony and Cleopatra,43,2.7.86,MENAS,All there is thine.
20030,Antony and Cleopatra,44,2.7.87,POMPEY,"Ah, this thou shouldst have done,"
20031,Antony and Cleopatra,44,2.7.88,POMPEY,"And not have spoke on't! In me 'tis villany,"
20032,Antony and Cleopatra,44,2.7.89,POMPEY,"In thee't had been good service. Thou must know,"
20033,Antony and Cleopatra,44,2.7.90,POMPEY,"'Tis not my profit that does lead mine honour,"

20037,Antony and Cleopatra,44,2.7.94,POMPEY,"But must condemn it now. Desist, and drink."
20038,Antony and Cleopatra,45,2.7.95,MENAS,"[Aside]  For this,"
20039,Antony and Cleopatra,45,2.7.96,MENAS,I'll never follow thy pall'd fortunes more.
20040,Antony and Cleopatra,45,2.7.97,MENAS,"Who seeks, and will not take when once 'tis offer'd,"
20041,Antony and Cleopatra,45,2.7.98,MENAS,Shall never find it more.
20042,Antony and Cleopatra,46,2.7.99,POMPEY,This health to Lepidus!
20043,Antony and Cleopatra,47,2.7.100,MARK ANTONY,"Bear him ashore. I'll pledge it for him, Pompey."

20046,Antony and Cleopatra,50,2.7.103,POMPEY,Fill till the cup be hid.
20047,Antony and Cleopatra,51,2.7.104,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"There's a strong fellow, Menas."
20048,Antony and Cleopatra,51,,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,Pointing to the Attendant who carries off LEPIDUS
20049,Antony and Cleopatra,52,2.7.105,MENAS,Why?
20050,Antony and Cleopatra,53,2.7.106,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"A' bears the third part of the world, man, see'st"
20051,Antony and Cleopatra,53,2.7.107,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,not?
20052,Antony and Cleopatra,54,2.7.108,MENAS,"The third part, then, is drunk: would it were all,"
20053,Antony and Cleopatra,54,2.7.109,MENAS,That it might go on wheels!
20054,Antony and Cleopatra,55,2.7.110,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Drink thou, increase the reels."
20055,Antony and Cleopatra,56,2.7.111,MENAS,Come.
20056,Antony and Cleopatra,57,2.7.112,POMPEY,This is not yet an Alexandrian feast.
20057,Antony and Cleopatra,58,2.7.113,MARK ANTONY,"It ripens towards it. Strike the vessels, ho?"
20058,Antony and Cleopatra,58,2.7.114,MARK ANTONY,Here is to Caesar!
20059,Antony and Cleopatra,59,2.7.115,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,I could well forbear't.
20060,Antony and Cleopatra,59,2.7.116,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"It's monstrous labour, when I wash my brain,"
20061,Antony and Cleopatra,59,2.7.117,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,And it grows fouler.
20062,Antony and Cleopatra,60,2.7.118,MARK ANTONY,Be a child o' the time.
20063,Antony and Cleopatra,61,2.7.119,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Possess it, I'll make answer:"
20064,Antony and Cleopatra,61,2.7.120,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,But I had rather fast from all four days
20065,Antony and Cleopatra,61,2.7.121,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,Than drink so much in one.
20066,Antony and Cleopatra,62,2.7.122,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Ha, my brave emperor!"
20067,Antony and Cleopatra,62,,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,To MARK ANTONY
20068,Antony and Cleopatra,62,2.7.123,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Shall we dance now the Egyptian Bacchanals,"
20069,Antony and Cleopatra,62,2.7.124,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,And celebrate our drink?
20070,Antony and Cleopatra,63,2.7.125,POMPEY,"Let's ha't, good soldier."
20071,Antony and Cleopatra,64,2.7.126,MARK ANTONY,"Come, let's all take hands,"
20072,Antony and Cleopatra,64,2.7.127,MARK ANTONY,Till that the conquering wine hath steep'd our sense
20073,Antony and Cleopatra,64,2.7.128,MARK ANTONY,In soft and delicate Lethe.
20074,Antony and Cleopatra,65,2.7.129,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,All take hands.
20075,Antony and Cleopatra,65,2.7.130,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,Make battery to our ears with the loud music:
20076,Antony and Cleopatra,65,2.7.131,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"The while I'll place you: then the boy shall sing,"
20077,Antony and Cleopatra,65,2.7.132,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,The holding every man shall bear as loud
20078,Antony and Cleopatra,65,2.7.133,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,As his strong sides can volley.
20079,Antony and Cleopatra,65,,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,Music plays. DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS places them hand in hand
20080,Antony and Cleopatra,65,2.7.134,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,THE SONG.
20081,Antony and Cleopatra,65,2.7.135,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Come, thou monarch of the vine,"
20082,Antony and Cleopatra,65,2.7.136,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,Plumpy Bacchus with pink eyne!
20083,Antony and Cleopatra,65,2.7.137,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"In thy fats our cares be drown'd,"
20084,Antony and Cleopatra,65,2.7.138,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,With thy grapes our hairs be crown'd:
20085,Antony and Cleopatra,65,2.7.139,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Cup us, till the world go round,"
20086,Antony and Cleopatra,65,2.7.140,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Cup us, till the world go round!"
20087,Antony and Cleopatra,66,2.7.141,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"What would you more? Pompey, good night. Good brother,"
20088,Antony and Cleopatra,66,2.7.142,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,Let me request you off: our graver business
20089,Antony and Cleopatra,66,2.7.143,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Frowns at this levity. Gentle lords, let's part,"
20090,Antony and Cleopatra,66,2.7.144,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,You see we have burnt our cheeks: strong Enobarb
20091,Antony and Cleopatra,66,2.7.145,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Is weaker than the wine, and mine own tongue"
20092,Antony and Cleopatra,66,2.7.146,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,Splits what it speaks: the wild disguise hath almost
20093,Antony and Cleopatra,66,2.7.147,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,Antick'd us all. What needs more words? Good night.
20094,Antony and Cleopatra,66,2.7.148,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Good Antony, your hand."
20095,Antony and Cleopatra,67,2.7.149,POMPEY,I'll try you on the shore.
20096,Antony and Cleopatra,68,2.7.150,MARK ANTONY,"And shall, sir, give's your hand."
20097,Antony and Cleopatra,69,2.7.151,POMPEY,"O Antony,"
20098,Antony and Cleopatra,69,2.7.152,POMPEY,"You have my father's house,--But, what? we are friends."
20099,Antony and Cleopatra,69,2.7.153,POMPEY,"Come, down into the boat."

20113,Antony and Cleopatra,73,,MENAS,"Enter VENTIDIUS as it were in triumph, with SILIUS,  and other Romans, Officers, and Soldiers, the dead body of PACORUS borne before him"
20114,Antony and Cleopatra,1,3.1.1,VENTIDIUS,"Now, darting Parthia, art thou struck, and now"
20115,Antony and Cleopatra,1,3.1.2,VENTIDIUS,Pleased fortune does of Marcus Crassus' death
20116,Antony and Cleopatra,1,3.1.3,VENTIDIUS,Make me revenger. Bear the king's son's body
20117,Antony and Cleopatra,1,3.1.4,VENTIDIUS,"Before our army. Thy Pacorus, Orodes,"
20118,Antony and Cleopatra,1,3.1.5,VENTIDIUS,Pays this for Marcus Crassus.
20119,Antony and Cleopatra,2,3.1.6,SILIUS,"Noble Ventidius,"
20120,Antony and Cleopatra,2,3.1.7,SILIUS,"Whilst yet with Parthian blood thy sword is warm,"
20121,Antony and Cleopatra,2,3.1.8,SILIUS,"The fugitive Parthians follow, spur through Media,"
20122,Antony and Cleopatra,2,3.1.9,SILIUS,"Mesopotamia, and the shelters whither"
20123,Antony and Cleopatra,2,3.1.10,SILIUS,The routed fly: so thy grand captain Antony
20124,Antony and Cleopatra,2,3.1.11,SILIUS,Shall set thee on triumphant chariots and
20125,Antony and Cleopatra,2,3.1.12,SILIUS,Put garlands on thy head.
20126,Antony and Cleopatra,3,3.1.13,VENTIDIUS,"O Silius, Silius,"

20130,Antony and Cleopatra,3,3.1.17,VENTIDIUS,Acquire too high a fame when him we serve's away.
20131,Antony and Cleopatra,3,3.1.18,VENTIDIUS,Caesar and Antony have ever won
20132,Antony and Cleopatra,3,3.1.19,VENTIDIUS,"More in their officer than person: Sossius,"
20133,Antony and Cleopatra,3,3.1.20,VENTIDIUS,"One of my place in Syria, his lieutenant,"
20134,Antony and Cleopatra,3,3.1.21,VENTIDIUS,"For quick accumulation of renown,"
20135,Antony and Cleopatra,3,3.1.22,VENTIDIUS,"Which he achieved by the minute, lost his favour."
20136,Antony and Cleopatra,3,3.1.23,VENTIDIUS,Who does i' the wars more than his captain can
20137,Antony and Cleopatra,3,3.1.24,VENTIDIUS,"Becomes his captain's captain: and ambition,"
20138,Antony and Cleopatra,3,3.1.25,VENTIDIUS,"The soldier's virtue, rather makes choice of loss,"
20139,Antony and Cleopatra,3,3.1.26,VENTIDIUS,Than gain which darkens him.
20140,Antony and Cleopatra,3,3.1.27,VENTIDIUS,"I could do more to do Antonius good,"
20141,Antony and Cleopatra,3,3.1.28,VENTIDIUS,"But 'twould offend him, and in his offence"
20142,Antony and Cleopatra,3,3.1.29,VENTIDIUS,Should my performance perish.
20143,Antony and Cleopatra,4,3.1.30,SILIUS,"Thou hast, Ventidius,"
20144,Antony and Cleopatra,4,3.1.31,SILIUS,that
20145,Antony and Cleopatra,4,3.1.32,SILIUS,"Without the which a soldier, and his sword,"
20146,Antony and Cleopatra,4,3.1.33,SILIUS,Grants scarce distinction. Thou wilt write to Antony!
20147,Antony and Cleopatra,5,3.1.34,VENTIDIUS,"I'll humbly signify what in his name,"
20148,Antony and Cleopatra,5,3.1.35,VENTIDIUS,"That magical word of war, we have effected,"
20149,Antony and Cleopatra,5,3.1.36,VENTIDIUS,"How, with his banners and his well-paid ranks,"
20150,Antony and Cleopatra,5,3.1.37,VENTIDIUS,The ne'er-yet-beaten horse of Parthia
20151,Antony and Cleopatra,5,3.1.38,VENTIDIUS,We have jaded out o' the field.

20153,Antony and Cleopatra,7,3.1.40,VENTIDIUS,"He purposeth to Athens: whither, with what haste"
20154,Antony and Cleopatra,7,3.1.41,VENTIDIUS,"The weight we must convey with's will permit,"
20155,Antony and Cleopatra,7,3.1.42,VENTIDIUS,"We shall appear before him. On there, pass along!"

20161,Antony and Cleopatra,2,3.2.3,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,The other three are sealing. Octavia weeps
20162,Antony and Cleopatra,2,3.2.4,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"To part from Rome, Caesar is sad, and Lepidus,"
20163,Antony and Cleopatra,2,3.2.5,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Since Pompey's feast, as Menas says, is troubled"
20164,Antony and Cleopatra,2,3.2.6,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,With the green sickness.
20165,Antony and Cleopatra,3,3.2.7,AGRIPPA,'Tis a noble Lepidus.
20166,Antony and Cleopatra,4,3.2.8,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"A very fine one: O, how he loves Caesar!"

20168,Antony and Cleopatra,6,3.2.10,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Caesar? Why, he's the Jupiter of men."
20169,Antony and Cleopatra,7,3.2.11,AGRIPPA,What's Antony? The god of Jupiter.
20170,Antony and Cleopatra,8,3.2.12,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,Spake you of Caesar? How! the non-pareil!

20173,Antony and Cleopatra,11,3.2.15,AGRIPPA,"Indeed, he plied them both with excellent praises."
20174,Antony and Cleopatra,12,3.2.16,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"But he loves Caesar best, yet he loves Antony:"
20175,Antony and Cleopatra,12,3.2.17,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Ho! hearts, tongues, figures, scribes, bards,"

20198,Antony and Cleopatra,18,3.2.38,MARK ANTONY,Make me not offended
20199,Antony and Cleopatra,18,3.2.39,MARK ANTONY,In your distrust.
20200,Antony and Cleopatra,19,3.2.40,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,I have said.

20213,Antony and Cleopatra,25,3.2.53,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"What, Octavia?"
20214,Antony and Cleopatra,26,3.2.54,OCTAVIA,I'll tell you in your ear.
20215,Antony and Cleopatra,27,3.2.55,MARK ANTONY,"Her tongue will not obey her heart, nor can"
20216,Antony and Cleopatra,27,3.2.56,MARK ANTONY,"Her heart inform her tongue,--the swan's"

20218,Antony and Cleopatra,27,3.2.58,MARK ANTONY,"That stands upon the swell at full of tide,"
20219,Antony and Cleopatra,27,3.2.59,MARK ANTONY,And neither way inclines.
20220,Antony and Cleopatra,28,3.2.60,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,[Aside to AGRIPPA]  Will Caesar weep?
20221,Antony and Cleopatra,29,3.2.61,AGRIPPA,[Aside to DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS]  He has a cloud in 's face.
20222,Antony and Cleopatra,30,3.2.62,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"[Aside to AGRIPPA]  He were the worse for that,"
20223,Antony and Cleopatra,30,3.2.63,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"were he a horse,"
20224,Antony and Cleopatra,30,3.2.64,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"So is he, being a man."
20225,Antony and Cleopatra,31,3.2.65,AGRIPPA,"[Aside to DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS]  Why, Enobarbus,"
20226,Antony and Cleopatra,31,3.2.66,AGRIPPA,"When Antony found Julius Caesar dead,"
20227,Antony and Cleopatra,31,3.2.67,AGRIPPA,"He cried almost to roaring, and he wept"
20228,Antony and Cleopatra,31,3.2.68,AGRIPPA,When at Philippi he found Brutus slain.
20229,Antony and Cleopatra,32,3.2.69,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"[Aside to AGRIPPA]  That year, indeed, he was"
20230,Antony and Cleopatra,32,3.2.70,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"troubled with a rheum,"
20231,Antony and Cleopatra,32,3.2.71,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"What willingly he did confound he wail'd,"
20232,Antony and Cleopatra,32,3.2.72,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Believe't, till I wept too."

20237,Antony and Cleopatra,34,3.2.77,MARK ANTONY,I'll wrestle with you in my strength of love:
20238,Antony and Cleopatra,34,3.2.78,MARK ANTONY,"Look, here I have you, thus I let you go,"
20239,Antony and Cleopatra,34,3.2.79,MARK ANTONY,And give you to the gods.
20240,Antony and Cleopatra,35,3.2.80,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Adieu, be happy!"

20250,Antony and Cleopatra,2,3.3.2,ALEXAS,Half afeard to come.
20251,Antony and Cleopatra,3,3.3.3,CLEOPATRA,"Go to, go to."
20252,Antony and Cleopatra,3,,CLEOPATRA,Enter the Messenger as before
20253,Antony and Cleopatra,3,3.3.4,CLEOPATRA,"Come hither, sir."
20254,Antony and Cleopatra,4,3.3.5,ALEXAS,"Good majesty,"
20255,Antony and Cleopatra,4,3.3.6,ALEXAS,Herod of Jewry dare not look upon you
20256,Antony and Cleopatra,4,3.3.7,ALEXAS,But when you are well pleased.
20257,Antony and Cleopatra,5,3.3.8,CLEOPATRA,That Herod's head
20258,Antony and Cleopatra,5,3.3.9,CLEOPATRA,"I'll have: but how, when Antony is gone"
20259,Antony and Cleopatra,5,3.3.10,CLEOPATRA,Through whom I might command it? Come thou near.
20260,Antony and Cleopatra,6,3.3.11,Messenger,"Most gracious majesty,--"
20261,Antony and Cleopatra,7,3.3.12,CLEOPATRA,Didst thou behold Octavia?
20262,Antony and Cleopatra,8,3.3.13,Messenger,"Ay, dread queen."

20264,Antony and Cleopatra,10,3.3.15,Messenger,"Madam, in Rome,"
20265,Antony and Cleopatra,10,3.3.16,Messenger,"I look'd her in the face, and saw her led"
20266,Antony and Cleopatra,10,3.3.17,Messenger,Between her brother and Mark Antony.
20267,Antony and Cleopatra,11,3.3.18,CLEOPATRA,Is she as tall as me?
20268,Antony and Cleopatra,12,3.3.19,Messenger,"She is not, madam."
20269,Antony and Cleopatra,13,3.3.20,CLEOPATRA,Didst hear her speak? is she shrill-tongued or low?
20270,Antony and Cleopatra,14,3.3.21,Messenger,"Madam, I heard her speak, she is low-voiced."
20271,Antony and Cleopatra,15,3.3.22,CLEOPATRA,That's not so good: he cannot like her long.
20272,Antony and Cleopatra,16,3.3.23,CHARMIAN,Like her! O Isis! 'tis impossible.
20273,Antony and Cleopatra,17,3.3.24,CLEOPATRA,"I think so, Charmian: dull of tongue, and dwarfish!"
20274,Antony and Cleopatra,17,3.3.25,CLEOPATRA,"What majesty is in her gait? Remember,"
20275,Antony and Cleopatra,17,3.3.26,CLEOPATRA,If e'er thou look'dst on majesty.
20276,Antony and Cleopatra,18,3.3.27,Messenger,She creeps:
20277,Antony and Cleopatra,18,3.3.28,Messenger,"Her motion and her station are as one,"
20278,Antony and Cleopatra,18,3.3.29,Messenger,"She shows a body rather than a life,"
20279,Antony and Cleopatra,18,3.3.30,Messenger,A statue than a breather.
20280,Antony and Cleopatra,19,3.3.31,CLEOPATRA,Is this certain?
20281,Antony and Cleopatra,20,3.3.32,Messenger,Or I have no observance.
20282,Antony and Cleopatra,21,3.3.33,CHARMIAN,Three in Egypt
20283,Antony and Cleopatra,21,3.3.34,CHARMIAN,Cannot make better note.
20284,Antony and Cleopatra,22,3.3.35,CLEOPATRA,"He's very knowing,"
20285,Antony and Cleopatra,22,3.3.36,CLEOPATRA,I do perceive't: there's nothing in her yet:
20286,Antony and Cleopatra,22,3.3.37,CLEOPATRA,The fellow has good judgment.
20287,Antony and Cleopatra,23,3.3.38,CHARMIAN,Excellent.
20288,Antony and Cleopatra,24,3.3.39,CLEOPATRA,"Guess at her years, I prithee."

20292,Antony and Cleopatra,27,3.3.43,Messenger,And I do think she's thirty.
20293,Antony and Cleopatra,28,3.3.44,CLEOPATRA,Bear'st thou her face in mind? is't long or round?
20294,Antony and Cleopatra,29,3.3.45,Messenger,Round even to faultiness.
20295,Antony and Cleopatra,30,3.3.46,CLEOPATRA,"For the most part, too, they are foolish that are so."
20296,Antony and Cleopatra,30,3.3.47,CLEOPATRA,"Her hair, what colour?"
20297,Antony and Cleopatra,31,3.3.48,Messenger,"Brown, madam: and her forehead"
20298,Antony and Cleopatra,31,3.3.49,Messenger,As low as she would wish it.
20299,Antony and Cleopatra,32,3.3.50,CLEOPATRA,There's gold for thee.
20300,Antony and Cleopatra,32,3.3.51,CLEOPATRA,Thou must not take my former sharpness ill:

20306,Antony and Cleopatra,34,3.3.56,CLEOPATRA,"Indeed, he is so: I repent me much"
20307,Antony and Cleopatra,34,3.3.57,CLEOPATRA,"That so I harried him. Why, methinks, by him,"
20308,Antony and Cleopatra,34,3.3.58,CLEOPATRA,This creature's no such thing.
20309,Antony and Cleopatra,35,3.3.59,CHARMIAN,"Nothing, madam."
20310,Antony and Cleopatra,36,3.3.60,CLEOPATRA,"The man hath seen some majesty, and should know."
20311,Antony and Cleopatra,37,3.3.61,CHARMIAN,"Hath he seen majesty? Isis else defend,"
20312,Antony and Cleopatra,37,3.3.62,CHARMIAN,And serving you so long!
20313,Antony and Cleopatra,38,3.3.63,CLEOPATRA,"I have one thing more to ask him yet, good Charmian:"
20314,Antony and Cleopatra,38,3.3.64,CLEOPATRA,"But 'tis no matter, thou shalt bring him to me"
20315,Antony and Cleopatra,38,3.3.65,CLEOPATRA,Where I will write. All may be well enough.

20321,Antony and Cleopatra,1,3.4.2,MARK ANTONY,"That were excusable, that, and thousands more"
20322,Antony and Cleopatra,1,3.4.3,MARK ANTONY,"Of semblable import,--but he hath waged"
20323,Antony and Cleopatra,1,3.4.4,MARK ANTONY,"New wars 'gainst Pompey, made his will, and read it"
20324,Antony and Cleopatra,1,3.4.5,MARK ANTONY,To public ear:
20325,Antony and Cleopatra,1,3.4.6,MARK ANTONY,Spoke scantly of me: when perforce he could not
20326,Antony and Cleopatra,1,3.4.7,MARK ANTONY,"But pay me terms of honour, cold and sickly"
20327,Antony and Cleopatra,1,3.4.8,MARK ANTONY,"He vented them, most narrow measure lent me:"
20328,Antony and Cleopatra,1,3.4.9,MARK ANTONY,"When the best hint was given him, he not took't,"
20329,Antony and Cleopatra,1,3.4.10,MARK ANTONY,Or did it from his teeth.
20330,Antony and Cleopatra,2,3.4.11,OCTAVIA,"O my good lord,"
20331,Antony and Cleopatra,2,3.4.12,OCTAVIA,"Believe not all, or, if you must believe,"
20332,Antony and Cleopatra,2,3.4.13,OCTAVIA,"Stomach not all. A more unhappy lady,"

20335,Antony and Cleopatra,2,3.4.16,OCTAVIA,"The good gods me presently,"
20336,Antony and Cleopatra,2,3.4.17,OCTAVIA,"When I shall pray, 'O bless my lord and husband!'"
20337,Antony and Cleopatra,2,3.4.18,OCTAVIA,"Undo that prayer, by crying out as loud,"
20338,Antony and Cleopatra,2,3.4.19,OCTAVIA,"'O, bless my brother!' Husband win, win brother,"
20339,Antony and Cleopatra,2,3.4.20,OCTAVIA,"Prays, and destroys the prayer, no midway"
20340,Antony and Cleopatra,2,3.4.21,OCTAVIA,'Twixt these extremes at all.

20343,Antony and Cleopatra,3,3.4.24,MARK ANTONY,"Best to preserve it: if I lose mine honour,"
20344,Antony and Cleopatra,3,3.4.25,MARK ANTONY,I lose myself: better I were not yours
20345,Antony and Cleopatra,3,3.4.26,MARK ANTONY,"Than yours so branchless. But, as you requested,"
20346,Antony and Cleopatra,3,3.4.27,MARK ANTONY,"Yourself shall go between 's: the mean time, lady,"
20347,Antony and Cleopatra,3,3.4.28,MARK ANTONY,I'll raise the preparation of a war
20348,Antony and Cleopatra,3,3.4.29,MARK ANTONY,"Shall stain your brother: make your soonest haste,"
20349,Antony and Cleopatra,3,3.4.30,MARK ANTONY,So your desires are yours.
20350,Antony and Cleopatra,4,3.4.31,OCTAVIA,Thanks to my lord.
20351,Antony and Cleopatra,4,3.4.32,OCTAVIA,"The Jove of power make me most weak, most weak,"
20352,Antony and Cleopatra,4,3.4.33,OCTAVIA,Your reconciler! Wars 'twixt you twain would be
20353,Antony and Cleopatra,4,3.4.34,OCTAVIA,"As if the world should cleave, and that slain men"
20354,Antony and Cleopatra,4,3.4.35,OCTAVIA,Should solder up the rift.
20355,Antony and Cleopatra,5,3.4.36,MARK ANTONY,"When it appears to you where this begins,"
20356,Antony and Cleopatra,5,3.4.37,MARK ANTONY,Turn your displeasure that way: for our faults
20357,Antony and Cleopatra,5,3.4.38,MARK ANTONY,"Can never be so equal, that your love"
20358,Antony and Cleopatra,5,3.4.39,MARK ANTONY,"Can equally move with them. Provide your going,"

20373,Antony and Cleopatra,6,3.5.10,EROS,"wrote to Pompey, upon his own appeal, seizes him: so"
20374,Antony and Cleopatra,6,3.5.11,EROS,"the poor third is up, till death enlarge his confine."
20375,Antony and Cleopatra,7,3.5.12,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Then, world, thou hast a pair of chaps, no more,"
20376,Antony and Cleopatra,7,3.5.13,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"And throw between them all the food thou hast,"
20377,Antony and Cleopatra,7,3.5.14,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,They'll grind the one the other. Where's Antony?
20378,Antony and Cleopatra,8,3.5.15,EROS,"He's walking in the garden--thus, and spurns"
20379,Antony and Cleopatra,8,3.5.16,EROS,"The rush that lies before him, cries, 'Fool Lepidus!'"
20380,Antony and Cleopatra,8,3.5.17,EROS,And threats the throat of that his officer

20394,Antony and Cleopatra,1,3.6.3,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"I' the market-place, on a tribunal silver'd,"
20395,Antony and Cleopatra,1,3.6.4,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,Cleopatra and himself in chairs of gold
20396,Antony and Cleopatra,1,3.6.5,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,Were publicly enthroned: at the feet sat

20398,Antony and Cleopatra,1,3.6.7,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,And all the unlawful issue that their lust
20399,Antony and Cleopatra,1,3.6.8,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,Since then hath made between them. Unto her

20509,Antony and Cleopatra,3,3.7.3,CLEOPATRA,"Thou hast forspoke my being in these wars,"
20510,Antony and Cleopatra,3,3.7.4,CLEOPATRA,And say'st it is not fit.
20511,Antony and Cleopatra,4,3.7.5,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Well, is it, is it?"
20512,Antony and Cleopatra,5,3.7.6,CLEOPATRA,"If not denounced against us, why should not we"

20514,Antony and Cleopatra,6,3.7.8,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"[Aside]  Well, I could reply:"
20515,Antony and Cleopatra,6,3.7.9,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"If we should serve with horse and mares together,"
20516,Antony and Cleopatra,6,3.7.10,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"The horse were merely lost, the mares would bear"

20518,Antony and Cleopatra,7,3.7.12,CLEOPATRA,What is't you say?
20519,Antony and Cleopatra,8,3.7.13,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Your presence needs must puzzle Antony,"

20521,Antony and Cleopatra,8,3.7.15,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"from's time,"
20522,Antony and Cleopatra,8,3.7.16,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,What should not then be spared. He is already
20523,Antony and Cleopatra,8,3.7.17,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Traduced for levity, and 'tis said in Rome"
20524,Antony and Cleopatra,8,3.7.18,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,That Photinus an eunuch and your maids

20537,Antony and Cleopatra,11,3.7.30,MARK ANTONY,"And take in Toryne? You have heard on't, sweet?"
20538,Antony and Cleopatra,12,3.7.31,CLEOPATRA,Celerity is never more admired
20539,Antony and Cleopatra,12,3.7.32,CLEOPATRA,Than by the negligent.
20540,Antony and Cleopatra,13,3.7.33,MARK ANTONY,"A good rebuke,"
20541,Antony and Cleopatra,13,3.7.34,MARK ANTONY,"Which might have well becomed the best of men,"
20542,Antony and Cleopatra,13,3.7.35,MARK ANTONY,"To taunt at slackness. Canidius, we"
20543,Antony and Cleopatra,13,3.7.36,MARK ANTONY,Will fight with him by sea.
20544,Antony and Cleopatra,14,3.7.37,CLEOPATRA,By sea! what else?
20545,Antony and Cleopatra,15,3.7.38,CANIDIUS,Why will my lord do so?
20546,Antony and Cleopatra,16,3.7.39,MARK ANTONY,For that he dares us to't.
20547,Antony and Cleopatra,17,3.7.40,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,So hath my lord dared him to single fight.
20548,Antony and Cleopatra,18,3.7.41,CANIDIUS,"Ay, and to wage this battle at Pharsalia."
20549,Antony and Cleopatra,18,3.7.42,CANIDIUS,"Where Caesar fought with Pompey: but these offers,"

20562,Antony and Cleopatra,21,3.7.55,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Distract your army, which doth most consist"
20563,Antony and Cleopatra,21,3.7.56,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Of war-mark'd footmen, leave unexecuted"
20564,Antony and Cleopatra,21,3.7.57,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Your own renowned knowledge, quite forego"

20567,Antony and Cleopatra,21,3.7.60,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,From firm security.
20568,Antony and Cleopatra,22,3.7.61,MARK ANTONY,I'll fight at sea.
20569,Antony and Cleopatra,23,3.7.62,CLEOPATRA,"I have sixty sails, Caesar none better."

20595,Antony and Cleopatra,30,3.7.85,CANIDIUS,"Not in the power on't: so our leader's led,"
20596,Antony and Cleopatra,30,3.7.86,CANIDIUS,And we are women's men.
20597,Antony and Cleopatra,31,3.7.87,Soldier,You keep by land

20601,Antony and Cleopatra,32,3.7.91,CANIDIUS,But we keep whole by land. This speed of Caesar's
20602,Antony and Cleopatra,32,3.7.92,CANIDIUS,Carries beyond belief.
20603,Antony and Cleopatra,33,3.7.93,Soldier,"While he was yet in Rome,"
20604,Antony and Cleopatra,33,3.7.94,Soldier,His power went out in such distractions as

20878,Antony and Cleopatra,21,3.13.57,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"He needs as many, sir, as Caesar has,"
20879,Antony and Cleopatra,21,3.13.58,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Or needs not us. If Caesar please, our master"
20880,Antony and Cleopatra,21,3.13.59,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Will leap to be his friend: for us, you know,"
20881,Antony and Cleopatra,21,3.13.60,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Whose he is we are, and that is, Caesar's."
20882,Antony and Cleopatra,22,3.13.61,THYREUS,So.
20883,Antony and Cleopatra,22,3.13.62,THYREUS,"Thus then, thou most renown'd: Caesar entreats,"
20884,Antony and Cleopatra,22,3.13.63,THYREUS,"Not to consider in what case thou stand'st,"
20885,Antony and Cleopatra,22,3.13.64,THYREUS,Further than he is Caesar.
20886,Antony and Cleopatra,23,3.13.65,CLEOPATRA,Go on: right royal.
20887,Antony and Cleopatra,24,3.13.66,THYREUS,He knows that you embrace not Antony
20888,Antony and Cleopatra,24,3.13.67,THYREUS,"As you did love, but as you fear'd him."
20889,Antony and Cleopatra,25,3.13.68,CLEOPATRA,O!
20890,Antony and Cleopatra,26,3.13.69,THYREUS,"The scars upon your honour, therefore, he"
20891,Antony and Cleopatra,26,3.13.70,THYREUS,"Does pity, as constrained blemishes,"
20892,Antony and Cleopatra,26,3.13.71,THYREUS,Not as deserved.
20893,Antony and Cleopatra,27,3.13.72,CLEOPATRA,"He is a god, and knows"
20894,Antony and Cleopatra,27,3.13.73,CLEOPATRA,"What is most right: mine honour was not yielded,"
20895,Antony and Cleopatra,27,3.13.74,CLEOPATRA,But conquer'd merely.
20896,Antony and Cleopatra,28,3.13.75,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"[Aside]             To be sure of that,"
20897,Antony and Cleopatra,28,3.13.76,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"I will ask Antony. Sir, sir, thou art so leaky,"
20898,Antony and Cleopatra,28,3.13.77,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"That we must leave thee to thy sinking, for"
20899,Antony and Cleopatra,28,3.13.78,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,Thy dearest quit thee.
20900,Antony and Cleopatra,28,,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,Exit
20901,Antony and Cleopatra,29,3.13.79,THYREUS,Shall I say to Caesar
20902,Antony and Cleopatra,29,3.13.80,THYREUS,What you require of him? for he partly begs
20903,Antony and Cleopatra,29,3.13.81,THYREUS,"To be desired to give. It much would please him,"
20904,Antony and Cleopatra,29,3.13.82,THYREUS,That of his fortunes you should make a staff
20905,Antony and Cleopatra,29,3.13.83,THYREUS,"To lean upon: but it would warm his spirits,"
20906,Antony and Cleopatra,29,3.13.84,THYREUS,"To hear from me you had left Antony,"
20907,Antony and Cleopatra,29,3.13.85,THYREUS,"And put yourself under his shrowd,"
20908,Antony and Cleopatra,29,3.13.86,THYREUS,The universal landlord.
20909,Antony and Cleopatra,30,3.13.87,CLEOPATRA,What's your name?
20910,Antony and Cleopatra,31,3.13.88,THYREUS,My name is Thyreus.
20911,Antony and Cleopatra,32,3.13.89,CLEOPATRA,"Most kind messenger,"
20912,Antony and Cleopatra,32,3.13.90,CLEOPATRA,Say to great Caesar this: in deputation
20913,Antony and Cleopatra,32,3.13.91,CLEOPATRA,"I kiss his conquering hand: tell him, I am prompt"
20914,Antony and Cleopatra,32,3.13.92,CLEOPATRA,"To lay my crown at 's feet, and there to kneel:"
20915,Antony and Cleopatra,32,3.13.93,CLEOPATRA,Tell him from his all-obeying breath I hear
20916,Antony and Cleopatra,32,3.13.94,CLEOPATRA,The doom of Egypt.
20917,Antony and Cleopatra,33,3.13.95,THYREUS,'Tis your noblest course.
20918,Antony and Cleopatra,33,3.13.96,THYREUS,"Wisdom and fortune combating together,"
20919,Antony and Cleopatra,33,3.13.97,THYREUS,"If that the former dare but what it can,"
20920,Antony and Cleopatra,33,3.13.98,THYREUS,No chance may shake it. Give me grace to lay
20921,Antony and Cleopatra,33,3.13.99,THYREUS,My duty on your hand.
20922,Antony and Cleopatra,34,3.13.100,CLEOPATRA,"Your Caesar's father oft,"
20923,Antony and Cleopatra,34,3.13.101,CLEOPATRA,"When he hath mused of taking kingdoms in,"
20924,Antony and Cleopatra,34,3.13.102,CLEOPATRA,"Bestow'd his lips on that unworthy place,"
20925,Antony and Cleopatra,34,3.13.103,CLEOPATRA,As it rain'd kisses.
20926,Antony and Cleopatra,34,,CLEOPATRA,Re-enter MARK ANTONY and DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
20927,Antony and Cleopatra,35,3.13.104,MARK ANTONY,"Favours, by Jove that thunders!"
20928,Antony and Cleopatra,35,3.13.105,MARK ANTONY,"What art thou, fellow?"
20929,Antony and Cleopatra,36,3.13.106,THYREUS,One that but performs
20930,Antony and Cleopatra,36,3.13.107,THYREUS,"The bidding of the fullest man, and worthiest"
20931,Antony and Cleopatra,36,3.13.108,THYREUS,To have command obey'd.
20932,Antony and Cleopatra,37,3.13.109,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,[Aside]               You will be whipp'd.
20933,Antony and Cleopatra,38,3.13.110,MARK ANTONY,"Approach, there! Ah, you kite! Now, gods"
20934,Antony and Cleopatra,38,3.13.111,MARK ANTONY,and devils!
20935,Antony and Cleopatra,38,3.13.112,MARK ANTONY,"Authority melts from me: of late, when I cried 'Ho!'"
20936,Antony and Cleopatra,38,3.13.113,MARK ANTONY,"Like boys unto a muss, kings would start forth,"
20937,Antony and Cleopatra,38,3.13.114,MARK ANTONY,And cry 'Your will?' Have you no ears? I am
20938,Antony and Cleopatra,38,3.13.115,MARK ANTONY,Antony yet.
20939,Antony and Cleopatra,38,,MARK ANTONY,Enter Attendants
20940,Antony and Cleopatra,38,3.13.116,MARK ANTONY,"Take hence this Jack, and whip him."
20941,Antony and Cleopatra,39,3.13.117,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,[Aside]  'Tis better playing with a lion's whelp
20942,Antony and Cleopatra,39,3.13.118,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,Than with an old one dying.
20943,Antony and Cleopatra,40,3.13.119,MARK ANTONY,Moon and stars!
20944,Antony and Cleopatra,40,3.13.120,MARK ANTONY,Whip him. Were't twenty of the greatest tributaries
20945,Antony and Cleopatra,40,3.13.121,MARK ANTONY,"That do acknowledge Caesar, should I find them"
20946,Antony and Cleopatra,40,3.13.122,MARK ANTONY,"So saucy with the hand of she here,--what's her name,"
20947,Antony and Cleopatra,40,3.13.123,MARK ANTONY,"Since she was Cleopatra? Whip him, fellows,"
20948,Antony and Cleopatra,40,3.13.124,MARK ANTONY,"Till, like a boy, you see him cringe his face,"
20949,Antony and Cleopatra,40,3.13.125,MARK ANTONY,And whine aloud for mercy: take him hence.
20950,Antony and Cleopatra,41,3.13.126,THYREUS,Mark Antony!
20951,Antony and Cleopatra,42,3.13.127,MARK ANTONY,"Tug him away: being whipp'd,"
20952,Antony and Cleopatra,42,3.13.128,MARK ANTONY,Bring him again: this Jack of Caesar's shall
20953,Antony and Cleopatra,42,3.13.129,MARK ANTONY,Bear us an errand to him.
20954,Antony and Cleopatra,42,,MARK ANTONY,Exeunt Attendants with THYREUS
20955,Antony and Cleopatra,42,3.13.130,MARK ANTONY,You were half blasted ere I knew you: ha!
20956,Antony and Cleopatra,42,3.13.131,MARK ANTONY,"Have I my pillow left unpress'd in Rome,"
20957,Antony and Cleopatra,42,3.13.132,MARK ANTONY,"Forborne the getting of a lawful race,"
20958,Antony and Cleopatra,42,3.13.133,MARK ANTONY,"And by a gem of women, to be abused"
20959,Antony and Cleopatra,42,3.13.134,MARK ANTONY,By one that looks on feeders?
20960,Antony and Cleopatra,43,3.13.135,CLEOPATRA,"Good my lord,--"
20961,Antony and Cleopatra,44,3.13.136,MARK ANTONY,You have been a boggler ever:
20962,Antony and Cleopatra,44,3.13.137,MARK ANTONY,But when we in our viciousness grow hard--
20963,Antony and Cleopatra,44,3.13.138,MARK ANTONY,"O misery on't!--the wise gods seel our eyes,"
20964,Antony and Cleopatra,44,3.13.139,MARK ANTONY,"In our own filth drop our clear judgments, make us"
20965,Antony and Cleopatra,44,3.13.140,MARK ANTONY,"Adore our errors, laugh at's, while we strut"
20966,Antony and Cleopatra,44,3.13.141,MARK ANTONY,To our confusion.
20967,Antony and Cleopatra,45,3.13.142,CLEOPATRA,"O, is't come to this?"
20968,Antony and Cleopatra,46,3.13.143,MARK ANTONY,I found you as a morsel cold upon
20969,Antony and Cleopatra,46,3.13.144,MARK ANTONY,"Dead Caesar's trencher, nay, you were a fragment"
20970,Antony and Cleopatra,46,3.13.145,MARK ANTONY,"Of Cneius Pompey's, besides what hotter hours,"
20971,Antony and Cleopatra,46,3.13.146,MARK ANTONY,"Unregister'd in vulgar fame, you have"
20972,Antony and Cleopatra,46,3.13.147,MARK ANTONY,"Luxuriously pick'd out: for, I am sure,"
20973,Antony and Cleopatra,46,3.13.148,MARK ANTONY,"Though you can guess what temperance should be,"
20974,Antony and Cleopatra,46,3.13.149,MARK ANTONY,You know not what it is.
20975,Antony and Cleopatra,47,3.13.150,CLEOPATRA,Wherefore is this?
20976,Antony and Cleopatra,48,3.13.151,MARK ANTONY,To let a fellow that will take rewards
20977,Antony and Cleopatra,48,3.13.152,MARK ANTONY,And say 'God quit you!' be familiar with
20978,Antony and Cleopatra,48,3.13.153,MARK ANTONY,"My playfellow, your hand, this kingly seal"
20979,Antony and Cleopatra,48,3.13.154,MARK ANTONY,"And plighter of high hearts! O, that I were"
20980,Antony and Cleopatra,48,3.13.155,MARK ANTONY,"Upon the hill of Basan, to outroar"
20981,Antony and Cleopatra,48,3.13.156,MARK ANTONY,"The horned herd! for I have savage cause,"
20982,Antony and Cleopatra,48,3.13.157,MARK ANTONY,"And to proclaim it civilly, were like"
20983,Antony and Cleopatra,48,3.13.158,MARK ANTONY,A halter'd neck which does the hangman thank
20984,Antony and Cleopatra,48,3.13.159,MARK ANTONY,For being yare about him.
20985,Antony and Cleopatra,48,,MARK ANTONY,Re-enter Attendants with THYREUS
20986,Antony and Cleopatra,48,3.13.160,MARK ANTONY,Is he whipp'd?
20987,Antony and Cleopatra,49,3.13.161,First Attendant,"Soundly, my lord."
20988,Antony and Cleopatra,50,3.13.162,MARK ANTONY,Cried he? and begg'd a' pardon?
20989,Antony and Cleopatra,51,3.13.163,First Attendant,He did ask favour.
20990,Antony and Cleopatra,52,3.13.164,MARK ANTONY,"If that thy father live, let him repent"
20991,Antony and Cleopatra,52,3.13.165,MARK ANTONY,"Thou wast not made his daughter, and be thou sorry"
20992,Antony and Cleopatra,52,3.13.166,MARK ANTONY,"To follow Caesar in his triumph, since"
20993,Antony and Cleopatra,52,3.13.167,MARK ANTONY,Thou hast been whipp'd for following him: henceforth
20994,Antony and Cleopatra,52,3.13.168,MARK ANTONY,"The white hand of a lady fever thee,"
20995,Antony and Cleopatra,52,3.13.169,MARK ANTONY,"Shake thou to look on 't. Get thee back to Caesar,"
20996,Antony and Cleopatra,52,3.13.170,MARK ANTONY,"Tell him thy entertainment: look, thou say"
20997,Antony and Cleopatra,52,3.13.171,MARK ANTONY,"He makes me angry with him, for he seems"
20998,Antony and Cleopatra,52,3.13.172,MARK ANTONY,"Proud and disdainful, harping on what I am,"
20999,Antony and Cleopatra,52,3.13.173,MARK ANTONY,"Not what he knew I was: he makes me angry,"
21000,Antony and Cleopatra,52,3.13.174,MARK ANTONY,"And at this time most easy 'tis to do't,"
21001,Antony and Cleopatra,52,3.13.175,MARK ANTONY,"When my good stars, that were my former guides,"
21002,Antony and Cleopatra,52,3.13.176,MARK ANTONY,"Have empty left their orbs, and shot their fires"
21003,Antony and Cleopatra,52,3.13.177,MARK ANTONY,Into the abysm of hell. If he mislike
21004,Antony and Cleopatra,52,3.13.178,MARK ANTONY,"My speech and what is done, tell him he has"
21005,Antony and Cleopatra,52,3.13.179,MARK ANTONY,"Hipparchus, my enfranched bondman, whom"
21006,Antony and Cleopatra,52,3.13.180,MARK ANTONY,"He may at pleasure whip, or hang, or torture,"
21007,Antony and Cleopatra,52,3.13.181,MARK ANTONY,"As he shall like, to quit me: urge it thou:"
21008,Antony and Cleopatra,52,3.13.182,MARK ANTONY,"Hence with thy stripes, begone!"
21009,Antony and Cleopatra,52,,MARK ANTONY,Exit THYREUS
21010,Antony and Cleopatra,53,3.13.183,CLEOPATRA,Have you done yet?
21011,Antony and Cleopatra,54,3.13.184,MARK ANTONY,"Alack, our terrene moon"
21012,Antony and Cleopatra,54,3.13.185,MARK ANTONY,"Is now eclipsed, and it portends alone"
21013,Antony and Cleopatra,54,3.13.186,MARK ANTONY,The fall of Antony!
21014,Antony and Cleopatra,55,3.13.187,CLEOPATRA,I must stay his time.
21015,Antony and Cleopatra,56,3.13.188,MARK ANTONY,"To flatter Caesar, would you mingle eyes"
21016,Antony and Cleopatra,56,3.13.189,MARK ANTONY,With one that ties his points?
21017,Antony and Cleopatra,57,3.13.190,CLEOPATRA,Not know me yet?
21018,Antony and Cleopatra,58,3.13.191,MARK ANTONY,Cold-hearted toward me?
21019,Antony and Cleopatra,59,3.13.192,CLEOPATRA,"Ah, dear, if I be so,"
21020,Antony and Cleopatra,59,3.13.193,CLEOPATRA,"From my cold heart let heaven engender hail,"
21021,Antony and Cleopatra,59,3.13.194,CLEOPATRA,"And poison it in the source, and the first stone"
21022,Antony and Cleopatra,59,3.13.195,CLEOPATRA,"Drop in my neck: as it determines, so"
21023,Antony and Cleopatra,59,3.13.196,CLEOPATRA,Dissolve my life! The next Caesarion smite!
21024,Antony and Cleopatra,59,3.13.197,CLEOPATRA,"Till by degrees the memory of my womb,"
21025,Antony and Cleopatra,59,3.13.198,CLEOPATRA,"Together with my brave Egyptians all,"
21026,Antony and Cleopatra,59,3.13.199,CLEOPATRA,"By the discandying of this pelleted storm,"
21027,Antony and Cleopatra,59,3.13.200,CLEOPATRA,"Lie graveless, till the flies and gnats of Nile"
21028,Antony and Cleopatra,59,3.13.201,CLEOPATRA,Have buried them for prey!
21029,Antony and Cleopatra,60,3.13.202,MARK ANTONY,I am satisfied.
21030,Antony and Cleopatra,60,3.13.203,MARK ANTONY,"Caesar sits down in Alexandria, where"
21031,Antony and Cleopatra,60,3.13.204,MARK ANTONY,I will oppose his fate. Our force by land
21032,Antony and Cleopatra,60,3.13.205,MARK ANTONY,"Hath nobly held, our sever'd navy too"
21033,Antony and Cleopatra,60,3.13.206,MARK ANTONY,"Have knit again, and fleet, threatening most sea-like."
21034,Antony and Cleopatra,60,3.13.207,MARK ANTONY,"Where hast thou been, my heart? Dost thou hear, lady?"
21035,Antony and Cleopatra,60,3.13.208,MARK ANTONY,If from the field I shall return once more
21036,Antony and Cleopatra,60,3.13.209,MARK ANTONY,"To kiss these lips, I will appear in blood,"
21037,Antony and Cleopatra,60,3.13.210,MARK ANTONY,I and my sword will earn our chronicle:
21038,Antony and Cleopatra,60,3.13.211,MARK ANTONY,There's hope in't yet.
21039,Antony and Cleopatra,61,3.13.212,CLEOPATRA,That's my brave lord!
21040,Antony and Cleopatra,62,3.13.213,MARK ANTONY,"I will be treble-sinew'd, hearted, breathed,"
21041,Antony and Cleopatra,62,3.13.214,MARK ANTONY,And fight maliciously: for when mine hours
21042,Antony and Cleopatra,62,3.13.215,MARK ANTONY,"Were nice and lucky, men did ransom lives"
21043,Antony and Cleopatra,62,3.13.216,MARK ANTONY,"Of me for jests, but now I'll set my teeth,"
21044,Antony and Cleopatra,62,3.13.217,MARK ANTONY,"And send to darkness all that stop me. Come,"
21045,Antony and Cleopatra,62,3.13.218,MARK ANTONY,Let's have one other gaudy night: call to me
21046,Antony and Cleopatra,62,3.13.219,MARK ANTONY,"All my sad captains, fill our bowls once more,"
21047,Antony and Cleopatra,62,3.13.220,MARK ANTONY,Let's mock the midnight bell.
21048,Antony and Cleopatra,63,3.13.221,CLEOPATRA,It is my birth-day:
21049,Antony and Cleopatra,63,3.13.222,CLEOPATRA,"I had thought to have held it poor: but, since my lord"
21050,Antony and Cleopatra,63,3.13.223,CLEOPATRA,"Is Antony again, I will be Cleopatra."
21051,Antony and Cleopatra,64,3.13.224,MARK ANTONY,We will yet do well.
21052,Antony and Cleopatra,65,3.13.225,CLEOPATRA,Call all his noble captains to my lord.
21053,Antony and Cleopatra,66,3.13.226,MARK ANTONY,"Do so, we'll speak to them, and to-night I'll force"
21054,Antony and Cleopatra,66,3.13.227,MARK ANTONY,"The wine peep through their scars. Come on, my queen,"
21055,Antony and Cleopatra,66,3.13.228,MARK ANTONY,"There's sap in't yet. The next time I do fight,"
21056,Antony and Cleopatra,66,3.13.229,MARK ANTONY,"I'll make death love me, for I will contend"
21057,Antony and Cleopatra,66,3.13.230,MARK ANTONY,Even with his pestilent scythe.
21058,Antony and Cleopatra,66,,MARK ANTONY,Exeunt all but DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
21059,Antony and Cleopatra,67,3.13.231,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Now he'll outstare the lightning. To be furious,"
21060,Antony and Cleopatra,67,3.13.232,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Is to be frighted out of fear, and in that mood"
21061,Antony and Cleopatra,67,3.13.233,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"The dove will peck the estridge, and I see still,"
21062,Antony and Cleopatra,67,3.13.234,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,A diminution in our captain's brain
21063,Antony and Cleopatra,67,3.13.235,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Restores his heart: when valour preys on reason,"
21064,Antony and Cleopatra,67,3.13.236,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,It eats the sword it fights with. I will seek
21065,Antony and Cleopatra,67,3.13.237,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,Some way to leave him.
21066,Antony and Cleopatra,67,,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,Exit
21067,Antony and Cleopatra,67,,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,ACT IV
21068,Antony and Cleopatra,67,,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,SCENE I. Before Alexandria. OCTAVIUS CAESAR's camp.
21069,Antony and Cleopatra,67,,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, AGRIPPA, and MECAENAS, with his Army, OCTAVIUS CAESAR reading a letter"
21070,Antony and Cleopatra,1,4.1.1,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"He calls me boy, and chides, as he had power"
21071,Antony and Cleopatra,1,4.1.2,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"To beat me out of Egypt, my messenger"
21072,Antony and Cleopatra,1,4.1.3,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"He hath whipp'd with rods, dares me to personal combat,"
21073,Antony and Cleopatra,1,4.1.4,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,Caesar to Antony: let the old ruffian know
21074,Antony and Cleopatra,1,4.1.5,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"I have many other ways to die, meantime"
21075,Antony and Cleopatra,1,4.1.6,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,Laugh at his challenge.
21076,Antony and Cleopatra,2,4.1.7,MECAENAS,"Caesar must think,"
21077,Antony and Cleopatra,2,4.1.8,MECAENAS,"When one so great begins to rage, he's hunted"
21078,Antony and Cleopatra,2,4.1.9,MECAENAS,"Even to falling. Give him no breath, but now"
21079,Antony and Cleopatra,2,4.1.10,MECAENAS,Make boot of his distraction: never anger
21080,Antony and Cleopatra,2,4.1.11,MECAENAS,Made good guard for itself.
21081,Antony and Cleopatra,3,4.1.12,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,Let our best heads
21082,Antony and Cleopatra,3,4.1.13,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Know, that to-morrow the last of many battles"
21083,Antony and Cleopatra,3,4.1.14,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"We mean to fight: within our files there are,"

21552,Antony and Cleopatra,3,4.13.11,CLEOPATRA,"And word it, prithee, piteously: hence, Mardian,"
21553,Antony and Cleopatra,3,4.13.12,CLEOPATRA,And bring me how he takes my death.
21554,Antony and Cleopatra,3,4.13.13,CLEOPATRA,To the monument!
21555,Antony and Cleopatra,3,,CLEOPATRA,Exeunt
21556,Antony and Cleopatra,3,,CLEOPATRA,SCENE XIV. The same. Another room.
21557,Antony and Cleopatra,3,,CLEOPATRA,Enter MARK ANTONY and EROS
21558,Antony and Cleopatra,1,4.14.1,MARK ANTONY,"Eros, thou yet behold'st me?"
21559,Antony and Cleopatra,2,4.14.2,EROS,"Ay, noble lord."
21560,Antony and Cleopatra,3,4.14.3,MARK ANTONY,"Sometimes we see a cloud that's dragonish,"
21561,Antony and Cleopatra,3,4.14.4,MARK ANTONY,"A vapour sometime like a bear or lion,"
21562,Antony and Cleopatra,3,4.14.5,MARK ANTONY,"A tower'd citadel, a pendent rock,"
21563,Antony and Cleopatra,3,4.14.6,MARK ANTONY,"A forked mountain, or blue promontory"
21564,Antony and Cleopatra,3,4.14.7,MARK ANTONY,"With trees upon't, that nod unto the world,"
21565,Antony and Cleopatra,3,4.14.8,MARK ANTONY,And mock our eyes with air: thou hast seen
21566,Antony and Cleopatra,3,4.14.9,MARK ANTONY,"these signs,"
21567,Antony and Cleopatra,3,4.14.10,MARK ANTONY,They are black vesper's pageants.
21568,Antony and Cleopatra,4,4.14.11,EROS,"Ay, my lord,"
21569,Antony and Cleopatra,5,4.14.12,MARK ANTONY,"That which is now a horse, even with a thought"
21570,Antony and Cleopatra,5,4.14.13,MARK ANTONY,"The rack dislimns, and makes it indistinct,"
21571,Antony and Cleopatra,5,4.14.14,MARK ANTONY,As water is in water.
21572,Antony and Cleopatra,6,4.14.15,EROS,"It does, my lord."
21573,Antony and Cleopatra,7,4.14.16,MARK ANTONY,"My good knave Eros, now thy captain is"
21574,Antony and Cleopatra,7,4.14.17,MARK ANTONY,Even such a body: here I am Antony:
21575,Antony and Cleopatra,7,4.14.18,MARK ANTONY,"Yet cannot hold this visible shape, my knave."
21576,Antony and Cleopatra,7,4.14.19,MARK ANTONY,"I made these wars for Egypt: and the queen,--"
21577,Antony and Cleopatra,7,4.14.20,MARK ANTONY,"Whose heart I thought I had, for she had mine,"
21578,Antony and Cleopatra,7,4.14.21,MARK ANTONY,Which whilst it was mine had annex'd unto't
21579,Antony and Cleopatra,7,4.14.22,MARK ANTONY,"A million more, now lost,--she, Eros, has"
21580,Antony and Cleopatra,7,4.14.23,MARK ANTONY,"Pack'd cards with Caesar, and false-play'd my glory"
21581,Antony and Cleopatra,7,4.14.24,MARK ANTONY,Unto an enemy's triumph.
21582,Antony and Cleopatra,7,4.14.25,MARK ANTONY,"Nay, weep not, gentle Eros, there is left us"
21583,Antony and Cleopatra,7,4.14.26,MARK ANTONY,Ourselves to end ourselves.
21584,Antony and Cleopatra,7,,MARK ANTONY,Enter MARDIAN
21585,Antony and Cleopatra,7,4.14.27,MARK ANTONY,O! thy vile lady!
21586,Antony and Cleopatra,7,4.14.28,MARK ANTONY,She has robb'd me of my sword.
21587,Antony and Cleopatra,8,4.14.29,MARDIAN,"No, Antony,"
21588,Antony and Cleopatra,8,4.14.30,MARDIAN,"My mistress loved thee, and her fortunes mingled"
21589,Antony and Cleopatra,8,4.14.31,MARDIAN,With thine entirely.
21590,Antony and Cleopatra,9,4.14.32,MARK ANTONY,"Hence, saucy eunuch, peace!"
21591,Antony and Cleopatra,9,4.14.33,MARK ANTONY,She hath betray'd me and shall die the death.
21592,Antony and Cleopatra,10,4.14.34,MARDIAN,"Death of one person can be paid but once,"
21593,Antony and Cleopatra,10,4.14.35,MARDIAN,And that she has discharged: what thou wouldst do
21594,Antony and Cleopatra,10,4.14.36,MARDIAN,Is done unto thy hand: the last she spake
21595,Antony and Cleopatra,10,4.14.37,MARDIAN,Was 'Antony! most noble Antony!'
21596,Antony and Cleopatra,10,4.14.38,MARDIAN,Then in the midst a tearing groan did break
21597,Antony and Cleopatra,10,4.14.39,MARDIAN,"The name of Antony, it was divided"
21598,Antony and Cleopatra,10,4.14.40,MARDIAN,"Between her heart and lips: she render'd life,"
21599,Antony and Cleopatra,10,4.14.41,MARDIAN,Thy name so buried in her.
21600,Antony and Cleopatra,11,4.14.42,MARK ANTONY,"Dead, then?"
21601,Antony and Cleopatra,12,4.14.43,MARDIAN,Dead.
21602,Antony and Cleopatra,13,4.14.44,MARK ANTONY,"Unarm, Eros, the long day's task is done,"
21603,Antony and Cleopatra,13,4.14.45,MARK ANTONY,And we must sleep.
21604,Antony and Cleopatra,13,,MARK ANTONY,To MARDIAN
21605,Antony and Cleopatra,13,4.14.46,MARK ANTONY,"That thou depart'st hence safe,"
21606,Antony and Cleopatra,13,4.14.47,MARK ANTONY,"Does pay thy labour richly, go."
21607,Antony and Cleopatra,13,,MARK ANTONY,Exit MARDIAN
21608,Antony and Cleopatra,13,4.14.48,MARK ANTONY,"Off, pluck off:"
21609,Antony and Cleopatra,13,4.14.49,MARK ANTONY,The seven-fold shield of Ajax cannot keep
21610,Antony and Cleopatra,13,4.14.50,MARK ANTONY,"The battery from my heart. O, cleave, my sides!"
21611,Antony and Cleopatra,13,4.14.51,MARK ANTONY,"Heart, once be stronger than thy continent,"
21612,Antony and Cleopatra,13,4.14.52,MARK ANTONY,"Crack thy frail case! Apace, Eros, apace."
21613,Antony and Cleopatra,13,4.14.53,MARK ANTONY,"No more a soldier: bruised pieces, go,"
21614,Antony and Cleopatra,13,4.14.54,MARK ANTONY,You have been nobly borne. From me awhile.
21615,Antony and Cleopatra,13,,MARK ANTONY,Exit EROS
21616,Antony and Cleopatra,13,4.14.55,MARK ANTONY,"I will o'ertake thee, Cleopatra, and"
21617,Antony and Cleopatra,13,4.14.56,MARK ANTONY,"Weep for my pardon. So it must be, for now"
21618,Antony and Cleopatra,13,4.14.57,MARK ANTONY,"All length is torture: since the torch is out,"
21619,Antony and Cleopatra,13,4.14.58,MARK ANTONY,"Lie down, and stray no farther: now all labour"
21620,Antony and Cleopatra,13,4.14.59,MARK ANTONY,"Mars what it does, yea, very force entangles"
21621,Antony and Cleopatra,13,4.14.60,MARK ANTONY,"Itself with strength: seal then, and all is done."
21622,Antony and Cleopatra,13,4.14.61,MARK ANTONY,"Eros!--I come, my queen:--Eros!--Stay for me:"
21623,Antony and Cleopatra,13,4.14.62,MARK ANTONY,"Where souls do couch on flowers, we'll hand in hand,"
21624,Antony and Cleopatra,13,4.14.63,MARK ANTONY,And with our sprightly port make the ghosts gaze:
21625,Antony and Cleopatra,13,4.14.64,MARK ANTONY,"Dido and her AEneas shall want troops,"
21626,Antony and Cleopatra,13,4.14.65,MARK ANTONY,"And all the haunt be ours. Come, Eros, Eros!"
21627,Antony and Cleopatra,13,,MARK ANTONY,Re-enter EROS
21628,Antony and Cleopatra,14,4.14.66,EROS,What would my lord?
21629,Antony and Cleopatra,15,4.14.67,MARK ANTONY,"Since Cleopatra died,"
21630,Antony and Cleopatra,15,4.14.68,MARK ANTONY,"I have lived in such dishonour, that the gods"
21631,Antony and Cleopatra,15,4.14.69,MARK ANTONY,"Detest my baseness. I, that with my sword"
21632,Antony and Cleopatra,15,4.14.70,MARK ANTONY,"Quarter'd the world, and o'er green Neptune's back"
21633,Antony and Cleopatra,15,4.14.71,MARK ANTONY,"With ships made cities, condemn myself to lack"
21634,Antony and Cleopatra,15,4.14.72,MARK ANTONY,"The courage of a woman, less noble mind"
21635,Antony and Cleopatra,15,4.14.73,MARK ANTONY,Than she which by her death our Caesar tells
21636,Antony and Cleopatra,15,4.14.74,MARK ANTONY,"'I am conqueror of myself.' Thou art sworn, Eros,"
21637,Antony and Cleopatra,15,4.14.75,MARK ANTONY,"That, when the exigent should come, which now"
21638,Antony and Cleopatra,15,4.14.76,MARK ANTONY,"Is come indeed, when I should see behind me"
21639,Antony and Cleopatra,15,4.14.77,MARK ANTONY,The inevitable prosecution of
21640,Antony and Cleopatra,15,4.14.78,MARK ANTONY,"Disgrace and horror, that, on my command,"
21641,Antony and Cleopatra,15,4.14.79,MARK ANTONY,"Thou then wouldst kill me: do't, the time is come:"
21642,Antony and Cleopatra,15,4.14.80,MARK ANTONY,"Thou strikest not me, 'tis Caesar thou defeat'st."
21643,Antony and Cleopatra,15,4.14.81,MARK ANTONY,Put colour in thy cheek.
21644,Antony and Cleopatra,16,4.14.82,EROS,The gods withhold me!
21645,Antony and Cleopatra,16,4.14.83,EROS,"Shall I do that which all the Parthian darts,"
21646,Antony and Cleopatra,16,4.14.84,EROS,"Though enemy, lost aim, and could not?"
21647,Antony and Cleopatra,17,4.14.85,MARK ANTONY,"Eros,"
21648,Antony and Cleopatra,17,4.14.86,MARK ANTONY,Wouldst thou be window'd in great Rome and see
21649,Antony and Cleopatra,17,4.14.87,MARK ANTONY,"Thy master thus with pleach'd arms, bending down"
21650,Antony and Cleopatra,17,4.14.88,MARK ANTONY,"His corrigible neck, his face subdued"
21651,Antony and Cleopatra,17,4.14.89,MARK ANTONY,"To penetrative shame, whilst the wheel'd seat"
21652,Antony and Cleopatra,17,4.14.90,MARK ANTONY,"Of fortunate Caesar, drawn before him, branded"
21653,Antony and Cleopatra,17,4.14.91,MARK ANTONY,His baseness that ensued?
21654,Antony and Cleopatra,18,4.14.92,EROS,I would not see't.
21655,Antony and Cleopatra,19,4.14.93,MARK ANTONY,"Come, then, for with a wound I must be cured."
21656,Antony and Cleopatra,19,4.14.94,MARK ANTONY,"Draw that thy honest sword, which thou hast worn"
21657,Antony and Cleopatra,19,4.14.95,MARK ANTONY,Most useful for thy country.
21658,Antony and Cleopatra,20,4.14.96,EROS,"O, sir, pardon me!"
21659,Antony and Cleopatra,21,4.14.97,MARK ANTONY,"When I did make thee free, sworest thou not then"
21660,Antony and Cleopatra,21,4.14.98,MARK ANTONY,"To do this when I bade thee? Do it at once,"
21661,Antony and Cleopatra,21,4.14.99,MARK ANTONY,Or thy precedent services are all
21662,Antony and Cleopatra,21,4.14.100,MARK ANTONY,"But accidents unpurposed. Draw, and come."
21663,Antony and Cleopatra,22,4.14.101,EROS,"Turn from me, then, that noble countenance,"
21664,Antony and Cleopatra,22,4.14.102,EROS,Wherein the worship of the whole world lies.
21665,Antony and Cleopatra,23,4.14.103,MARK ANTONY,Lo thee!
21666,Antony and Cleopatra,23,,MARK ANTONY,Turning from him
21667,Antony and Cleopatra,24,4.14.104,EROS,My sword is drawn.
21668,Antony and Cleopatra,25,4.14.105,MARK ANTONY,Then let it do at once
21669,Antony and Cleopatra,25,4.14.106,MARK ANTONY,The thing why thou hast drawn it.
21670,Antony and Cleopatra,26,4.14.107,EROS,"My dear master,"
21671,Antony and Cleopatra,26,4.14.108,EROS,"My captain, and my emperor, let me say,"
21672,Antony and Cleopatra,26,4.14.109,EROS,"Before I strike this bloody stroke, farewell."
21673,Antony and Cleopatra,27,4.14.110,MARK ANTONY,"'Tis said, man, and farewell."
21674,Antony and Cleopatra,28,4.14.111,EROS,"Farewell, great chief. Shall I strike now?"
21675,Antony and Cleopatra,29,4.14.112,MARK ANTONY,"Now, Eros."
21676,Antony and Cleopatra,30,4.14.113,EROS,"Why, there then: thus I do escape the sorrow"
21677,Antony and Cleopatra,30,4.14.114,EROS,Of Antony's death.
21678,Antony and Cleopatra,30,,EROS,Kills himself
21679,Antony and Cleopatra,31,4.14.115,MARK ANTONY,Thrice-nobler than myself!
21680,Antony and Cleopatra,31,4.14.116,MARK ANTONY,"Thou teachest me, O valiant Eros, what"
21681,Antony and Cleopatra,31,4.14.117,MARK ANTONY,"I should, and thou couldst not. My queen and Eros"
21682,Antony and Cleopatra,31,4.14.118,MARK ANTONY,Have by their brave instruction got upon me
21683,Antony and Cleopatra,31,4.14.119,MARK ANTONY,A nobleness in record: but I will be
21684,Antony and Cleopatra,31,4.14.120,MARK ANTONY,"A bridegroom in my death, and run into't"
21685,Antony and Cleopatra,31,4.14.121,MARK ANTONY,"As to a lover's bed. Come, then, and, Eros,"
21686,Antony and Cleopatra,31,4.14.122,MARK ANTONY,Thy master dies thy scholar: to do thus
21687,Antony and Cleopatra,31,,MARK ANTONY,Falling on his sword
21688,Antony and Cleopatra,31,4.14.123,MARK ANTONY,I learn'd of thee. How! not dead? not dead?
21689,Antony and Cleopatra,31,4.14.124,MARK ANTONY,"The guard, ho! O, dispatch me!"
21690,Antony and Cleopatra,31,,MARK ANTONY,Enter DERCETAS and Guard
21691,Antony and Cleopatra,32,4.14.125,First Guard,What's the noise?
21692,Antony and Cleopatra,33,4.14.126,MARK ANTONY,"I have done my work in, friends: O, make an end"
21693,Antony and Cleopatra,33,4.14.127,MARK ANTONY,Of what I have begun.
21694,Antony and Cleopatra,34,4.14.128,Second Guard,The star is fall'n.
21695,Antony and Cleopatra,35,4.14.129,First Guard,And time is at his period.
21696,Antony and Cleopatra,36,4.14.130,All,"Alas, and woe!"
21697,Antony and Cleopatra,37,4.14.131,MARK ANTONY,Let him that loves me strike me dead.
21698,Antony and Cleopatra,38,4.14.132,First Guard,Not I.
21699,Antony and Cleopatra,39,4.14.133,Second Guard,Nor I.
21700,Antony and Cleopatra,40,4.14.134,Third Guard,Nor any one.
21701,Antony and Cleopatra,40,,Third Guard,Exeunt Guard
21702,Antony and Cleopatra,41,4.14.135,DERCETAS,Thy death and fortunes bid thy followers fly.

21704,Antony and Cleopatra,41,4.14.137,DERCETAS,Shall enter me with him.
21705,Antony and Cleopatra,41,,DERCETAS,Enter DIOMEDES
21706,Antony and Cleopatra,42,4.14.138,DIOMEDES,Where's Antony?
21707,Antony and Cleopatra,43,4.14.139,DERCETAS,"There, Diomed there."
21708,Antony and Cleopatra,44,4.14.140,DIOMEDES,Lives he?
21709,Antony and Cleopatra,44,4.14.141,DIOMEDES,"Wilt thou not answer, man?"
21710,Antony and Cleopatra,44,,DIOMEDES,Exit DERCETAS
21711,Antony and Cleopatra,45,4.14.142,MARK ANTONY,"Art thou there, Diomed? Draw thy sword, and give me"
21712,Antony and Cleopatra,45,4.14.143,MARK ANTONY,Sufficing strokes for death.
21713,Antony and Cleopatra,46,4.14.144,DIOMEDES,"Most absolute lord,"
21714,Antony and Cleopatra,46,4.14.145,DIOMEDES,My mistress Cleopatra sent me to thee.
21715,Antony and Cleopatra,47,4.14.146,MARK ANTONY,When did she send thee?

21718,Antony and Cleopatra,50,4.14.149,DIOMEDES,Lock'd in her monument. She had a prophesying fear
21719,Antony and Cleopatra,50,4.14.150,DIOMEDES,Of what hath come to pass: for when she saw--
21720,Antony and Cleopatra,50,4.14.151,DIOMEDES,Which never shall be found--you did suspect
21721,Antony and Cleopatra,50,4.14.152,DIOMEDES,"She had disposed with Caesar, and that your rage"
21722,Antony and Cleopatra,50,4.14.153,DIOMEDES,"Would not be purged, she sent you word she was dead,"
21723,Antony and Cleopatra,50,4.14.154,DIOMEDES,"But, fearing since how it might work, hath sent"
21724,Antony and Cleopatra,50,4.14.155,DIOMEDES,"Me to proclaim the truth, and I am come,"
21725,Antony and Cleopatra,50,4.14.156,DIOMEDES,"I dread, too late."
21726,Antony and Cleopatra,51,4.14.157,MARK ANTONY,"Too late, good Diomed: call my guard, I prithee."
21727,Antony and Cleopatra,52,4.14.158,DIOMEDES,"What, ho, the emperor's guard! The guard, what, ho!"
21728,Antony and Cleopatra,52,4.14.159,DIOMEDES,"Come, your lord calls!"
21729,Antony and Cleopatra,52,,DIOMEDES,Enter four or five of the Guard of MARK ANTONY

21773,Antony and Cleopatra,9,4.15.28,CLEOPATRA,"Dear my lord, pardon,--I dare not,"
21774,Antony and Cleopatra,9,4.15.29,CLEOPATRA,Lest I be taken: not the imperious show
21775,Antony and Cleopatra,9,4.15.30,CLEOPATRA,Of the full-fortuned Caesar ever shall
21776,Antony and Cleopatra,9,4.15.31,CLEOPATRA,"Be brooch'd with me, if knife, drugs,"
21777,Antony and Cleopatra,9,4.15.32,CLEOPATRA,"serpents, have"
21778,Antony and Cleopatra,9,4.15.33,CLEOPATRA,"Edge, sting, or operation, I am safe:"
21779,Antony and Cleopatra,9,4.15.34,CLEOPATRA,"Your wife Octavia, with her modest eyes"
21780,Antony and Cleopatra,9,4.15.35,CLEOPATRA,"And still conclusion, shall acquire no honour"
21781,Antony and Cleopatra,9,4.15.36,CLEOPATRA,"Demuring upon me. But come, come, Antony,--"
21782,Antony and Cleopatra,9,4.15.37,CLEOPATRA,"Help me, my women,--we must draw thee up:"
21783,Antony and Cleopatra,9,4.15.38,CLEOPATRA,"Assist, good friends."
21784,Antony and Cleopatra,10,4.15.39,MARK ANTONY,"O, quick, or I am gone."
21785,Antony and Cleopatra,11,4.15.40,CLEOPATRA,Here's sport indeed! How heavy weighs my lord!
21786,Antony and Cleopatra,11,4.15.41,CLEOPATRA,"Our strength is all gone into heaviness,"
21787,Antony and Cleopatra,11,4.15.42,CLEOPATRA,"That makes the weight: had I great Juno's power,"
21788,Antony and Cleopatra,11,4.15.43,CLEOPATRA,"The strong-wing'd Mercury should fetch thee up,"
21789,Antony and Cleopatra,11,4.15.44,CLEOPATRA,"And set thee by Jove's side. Yet come a little,--"
21790,Antony and Cleopatra,11,4.15.45,CLEOPATRA,"Wishes were ever fools,--O, come, come, come,"
21791,Antony and Cleopatra,11,,CLEOPATRA,They heave MARK ANTONY aloft to CLEOPATRA
21792,Antony and Cleopatra,11,4.15.46,CLEOPATRA,"And welcome, welcome! die where thou hast lived:"
21793,Antony and Cleopatra,11,4.15.47,CLEOPATRA,"Quicken with kissing: had my lips that power,"
21794,Antony and Cleopatra,11,4.15.48,CLEOPATRA,Thus would I wear them out.
21795,Antony and Cleopatra,12,4.15.49,All,A heavy sight!
21796,Antony and Cleopatra,13,4.15.50,MARK ANTONY,"I am dying, Egypt, dying:"
21797,Antony and Cleopatra,13,4.15.51,MARK ANTONY,"Give me some wine, and let me speak a little."
21798,Antony and Cleopatra,14,4.15.52,CLEOPATRA,"No, let me speak, and let me rail so high,"
21799,Antony and Cleopatra,14,4.15.53,CLEOPATRA,"That the false housewife Fortune break her wheel,"
21800,Antony and Cleopatra,14,4.15.54,CLEOPATRA,Provoked by my offence.
21801,Antony and Cleopatra,15,4.15.55,MARK ANTONY,"One word, sweet queen:"
21802,Antony and Cleopatra,15,4.15.56,MARK ANTONY,"Of Caesar seek your honour, with your safety. O!"
21803,Antony and Cleopatra,16,4.15.57,CLEOPATRA,They do not go together.
21804,Antony and Cleopatra,17,4.15.58,MARK ANTONY,"Gentle, hear me:"
21805,Antony and Cleopatra,17,4.15.59,MARK ANTONY,None about Caesar trust but Proculeius.
21806,Antony and Cleopatra,18,4.15.60,CLEOPATRA,"My resolution and my hands I'll trust,"
21807,Antony and Cleopatra,18,4.15.61,CLEOPATRA,None about Caesar.
21808,Antony and Cleopatra,19,4.15.62,MARK ANTONY,The miserable change now at my end
21809,Antony and Cleopatra,19,4.15.63,MARK ANTONY,"Lament nor sorrow at, but please your thoughts"
21810,Antony and Cleopatra,19,4.15.64,MARK ANTONY,In feeding them with those my former fortunes
21811,Antony and Cleopatra,19,4.15.65,MARK ANTONY,"Wherein I lived, the greatest prince o' the world,"
21812,Antony and Cleopatra,19,4.15.66,MARK ANTONY,"The noblest, and do now not basely die,"
21813,Antony and Cleopatra,19,4.15.67,MARK ANTONY,Not cowardly put off my helmet to
21814,Antony and Cleopatra,19,4.15.68,MARK ANTONY,"My countryman,--a Roman by a Roman"
21815,Antony and Cleopatra,19,4.15.69,MARK ANTONY,"Valiantly vanquish'd. Now my spirit is going,"
21816,Antony and Cleopatra,19,4.15.70,MARK ANTONY,I can no more.
21817,Antony and Cleopatra,20,4.15.71,CLEOPATRA,"Noblest of men, woo't die?"
21818,Antony and Cleopatra,20,4.15.72,CLEOPATRA,Hast thou no care of me? shall I abide
21819,Antony and Cleopatra,20,4.15.73,CLEOPATRA,"In this dull world, which in thy absence is"
21820,Antony and Cleopatra,20,4.15.74,CLEOPATRA,"No better than a sty? O, see, my women,"
21821,Antony and Cleopatra,20,,CLEOPATRA,MARK ANTONY dies
21822,Antony and Cleopatra,20,4.15.75,CLEOPATRA,The crown o' the earth doth melt. My lord!
21823,Antony and Cleopatra,20,4.15.76,CLEOPATRA,"O, wither'd is the garland of the war,"
21824,Antony and Cleopatra,20,4.15.77,CLEOPATRA,The soldier's pole is fall'n: young boys and girls
21825,Antony and Cleopatra,20,4.15.78,CLEOPATRA,"Are level now with men, the odds is gone,"
21826,Antony and Cleopatra,20,4.15.79,CLEOPATRA,And there is nothing left remarkable
21827,Antony and Cleopatra,20,4.15.80,CLEOPATRA,Beneath the visiting moon.
21828,Antony and Cleopatra,20,,CLEOPATRA,Faints
21829,Antony and Cleopatra,21,4.15.81,CHARMIAN,"O, quietness, lady!"
21830,Antony and Cleopatra,22,4.15.82,IRAS,"She is dead too, our sovereign."
21831,Antony and Cleopatra,23,4.15.83,CHARMIAN,Lady!
21832,Antony and Cleopatra,24,4.15.84,IRAS,Madam!
21833,Antony and Cleopatra,25,4.15.85,CHARMIAN,"O madam, madam, madam!"
21834,Antony and Cleopatra,26,4.15.86,IRAS,"Royal Egypt, Empress!"
21835,Antony and Cleopatra,27,4.15.87,CHARMIAN,"Peace, peace, Iras!"
21836,Antony and Cleopatra,28,4.15.88,CLEOPATRA,"No more, but e'en a woman, and commanded"
21837,Antony and Cleopatra,28,4.15.89,CLEOPATRA,By such poor passion as the maid that milks
21838,Antony and Cleopatra,28,4.15.90,CLEOPATRA,And does the meanest chares. It were for me
21839,Antony and Cleopatra,28,4.15.91,CLEOPATRA,"To throw my sceptre at the injurious gods,"
21840,Antony and Cleopatra,28,4.15.92,CLEOPATRA,To tell them that this world did equal theirs
21841,Antony and Cleopatra,28,4.15.93,CLEOPATRA,"Till they had stol'n our jewel. All's but naught,"
21842,Antony and Cleopatra,28,4.15.94,CLEOPATRA,"Patience is scottish, and impatience does"
21843,Antony and Cleopatra,28,4.15.95,CLEOPATRA,Become a dog that's mad: then is it sin
21844,Antony and Cleopatra,28,4.15.96,CLEOPATRA,"To rush into the secret house of death,"
21845,Antony and Cleopatra,28,4.15.97,CLEOPATRA,"Ere death dare come to us? How do you, women?"
21846,Antony and Cleopatra,28,4.15.98,CLEOPATRA,"What, what! good cheer! Why, how now, Charmian!"
21847,Antony and Cleopatra,28,4.15.99,CLEOPATRA,"My noble girls! Ah, women, women, look,"
21848,Antony and Cleopatra,28,4.15.100,CLEOPATRA,"Our lamp is spent, it's out! Good sirs, take heart:"
21849,Antony and Cleopatra,28,4.15.101,CLEOPATRA,"We'll bury him, and then, what's brave,"
21850,Antony and Cleopatra,28,4.15.102,CLEOPATRA,"what's noble,"
21851,Antony and Cleopatra,28,4.15.103,CLEOPATRA,"Let's do it after the high Roman fashion,"
21852,Antony and Cleopatra,28,4.15.104,CLEOPATRA,"And make death proud to take us. Come, away:"
21853,Antony and Cleopatra,28,4.15.105,CLEOPATRA,This case of that huge spirit now is cold:
21854,Antony and Cleopatra,28,4.15.106,CLEOPATRA,"Ah, women, women! come, we have no friend"
21855,Antony and Cleopatra,28,4.15.107,CLEOPATRA,"But resolution, and the briefest end."
21856,Antony and Cleopatra,28,4.15.107,CLEOPATRA,"Exeunt, those above bearing off MARK ANTONY's body"
21857,Antony and Cleopatra,28,4.15.107,CLEOPATRA,ACT V
21858,Antony and Cleopatra,28,4.15.107,CLEOPATRA,SCENE I. Alexandria. OCTAVIUS CAESAR's camp.
21859,Antony and Cleopatra,28,,CLEOPATRA,"Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, AGRIPPA, DOLABELLA, MECAENAS, GALLUS, PROCULEIUS, and others, his council of war"
21860,Antony and Cleopatra,1,5.1.1,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Go to him, Dolabella, bid him yield,"
21861,Antony and Cleopatra,1,5.1.2,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Being so frustrate, tell him he mocks"
21862,Antony and Cleopatra,1,5.1.3,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,The pauses that he makes.
21863,Antony and Cleopatra,2,5.1.4,DOLABELLA,"Caesar, I shall."
21864,Antony and Cleopatra,2,,DOLABELLA,Exit
21865,Antony and Cleopatra,2,,DOLABELLA,"Enter DERCETAS, with the sword of MARK ANTONY"
21866,Antony and Cleopatra,3,5.1.5,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,Wherefore is that? and what art thou that darest
21867,Antony and Cleopatra,3,5.1.6,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,Appear thus to us?
21868,Antony and Cleopatra,4,5.1.7,DERCETAS,"I am call'd Dercetas,"
21869,Antony and Cleopatra,4,5.1.8,DERCETAS,"Mark Antony I served, who best was worthy"
21870,Antony and Cleopatra,4,5.1.9,DERCETAS,"Best to be served: whilst he stood up and spoke,"
21871,Antony and Cleopatra,4,5.1.10,DERCETAS,"He was my master, and I wore my life"
21872,Antony and Cleopatra,4,5.1.11,DERCETAS,To spend upon his haters. If thou please
21873,Antony and Cleopatra,4,5.1.12,DERCETAS,"To take me to thee, as I was to him"
21874,Antony and Cleopatra,4,5.1.13,DERCETAS,"I'll be to Caesar, if thou pleasest not,"
21875,Antony and Cleopatra,4,5.1.14,DERCETAS,I yield thee up my life.
21876,Antony and Cleopatra,5,5.1.15,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,What is't thou say'st?
21877,Antony and Cleopatra,6,5.1.16,DERCETAS,"I say, O Caesar, Antony is dead."
21878,Antony and Cleopatra,7,5.1.17,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,The breaking of so great a thing should make
21879,Antony and Cleopatra,7,5.1.18,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,A greater crack: the round world
21880,Antony and Cleopatra,7,5.1.19,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Should have shook lions into civil streets,"
21881,Antony and Cleopatra,7,5.1.20,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,And citizens to their dens: the death of Antony
21882,Antony and Cleopatra,7,5.1.21,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Is not a single doom, in the name lay"
21883,Antony and Cleopatra,7,5.1.22,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,A moiety of the world.
21884,Antony and Cleopatra,8,5.1.23,DERCETAS,"He is dead, Caesar:"
21885,Antony and Cleopatra,8,5.1.24,DERCETAS,"Not by a public minister of justice,"
21886,Antony and Cleopatra,8,5.1.25,DERCETAS,"Nor by a hired knife, but that self hand,"
21887,Antony and Cleopatra,8,5.1.26,DERCETAS,"Which writ his honour in the acts it did,"
21888,Antony and Cleopatra,8,5.1.27,DERCETAS,"Hath, with the courage which the heart did lend it,"
21889,Antony and Cleopatra,8,5.1.28,DERCETAS,"Splitted the heart. This is his sword,"
21890,Antony and Cleopatra,8,5.1.29,DERCETAS,"I robb'd his wound of it, behold it stain'd"
21891,Antony and Cleopatra,8,5.1.30,DERCETAS,With his most noble blood.
21892,Antony and Cleopatra,9,5.1.31,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Look you sad, friends?"
21893,Antony and Cleopatra,9,5.1.32,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"The gods rebuke me, but it is tidings"
21894,Antony and Cleopatra,9,5.1.33,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,To wash the eyes of kings.
21895,Antony and Cleopatra,10,5.1.34,AGRIPPA,"And strange it is,"
21896,Antony and Cleopatra,10,5.1.35,AGRIPPA,That nature must compel us to lament
21897,Antony and Cleopatra,10,5.1.36,AGRIPPA,Our most persisted deeds.
21898,Antony and Cleopatra,11,5.1.37,MECAENAS,His taints and honours
21899,Antony and Cleopatra,11,5.1.38,MECAENAS,Waged equal with him.
21900,Antony and Cleopatra,12,5.1.39,AGRIPPA,A rarer spirit never
21901,Antony and Cleopatra,12,5.1.40,AGRIPPA,"Did steer humanity: but you, gods, will give us"
21902,Antony and Cleopatra,12,5.1.41,AGRIPPA,Some faults to make us men. Caesar is touch'd.
21903,Antony and Cleopatra,13,5.1.42,MECAENAS,"When such a spacious mirror's set before him,"
21904,Antony and Cleopatra,13,5.1.43,MECAENAS,He needs must see himself.
21905,Antony and Cleopatra,14,5.1.44,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,O Antony!
21906,Antony and Cleopatra,14,5.1.45,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"I have follow'd thee to this, but we do lance"
21907,Antony and Cleopatra,14,5.1.46,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,Diseases in our bodies: I must perforce
21908,Antony and Cleopatra,14,5.1.47,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Have shown to thee such a declining day,"
21909,Antony and Cleopatra,14,5.1.48,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Or look on thine, we could not stall together"
21910,Antony and Cleopatra,14,5.1.49,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"In the whole world: but yet let me lament,"
21911,Antony and Cleopatra,14,5.1.50,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"With tears as sovereign as the blood of hearts,"
21912,Antony and Cleopatra,14,5.1.51,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"That thou, my brother, my competitor"
21913,Antony and Cleopatra,14,5.1.52,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"In top of all design, my mate in empire,"
21914,Antony and Cleopatra,14,5.1.53,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Friend and companion in the front of war,"
21915,Antony and Cleopatra,14,5.1.54,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"The arm of mine own body, and the heart"
21916,Antony and Cleopatra,14,5.1.55,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Where mine his thoughts did kindle,--that our stars,"
21917,Antony and Cleopatra,14,5.1.56,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Unreconciliable, should divide"
21918,Antony and Cleopatra,14,5.1.57,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Our equalness to this. Hear me, good friends--"
21919,Antony and Cleopatra,14,5.1.58,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,But I will tell you at some meeter season:
21920,Antony and Cleopatra,14,,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,Enter an Egyptian
21921,Antony and Cleopatra,14,5.1.59,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"The business of this man looks out of him,"
21922,Antony and Cleopatra,14,5.1.60,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,We'll hear him what he says. Whence are you?
21923,Antony and Cleopatra,15,5.1.61,Egyptian,"A poor Egyptian yet. The queen my mistress,"
21924,Antony and Cleopatra,15,5.1.62,Egyptian,"Confined in all she has, her monument,"
21925,Antony and Cleopatra,15,5.1.63,Egyptian,"Of thy intents desires instruction,"
21926,Antony and Cleopatra,15,5.1.64,Egyptian,That she preparedly may frame herself
21927,Antony and Cleopatra,15,5.1.65,Egyptian,To the way she's forced to.
21928,Antony and Cleopatra,16,5.1.66,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,Bid her have good heart:
21929,Antony and Cleopatra,16,5.1.67,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"She soon shall know of us, by some of ours,"
21930,Antony and Cleopatra,16,5.1.68,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,How honourable and how kindly we
21931,Antony and Cleopatra,16,5.1.69,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Determine for her, for Caesar cannot live"
21932,Antony and Cleopatra,16,5.1.70,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,To be ungentle.
21933,Antony and Cleopatra,17,5.1.71,Egyptian,So the gods preserve thee!
21934,Antony and Cleopatra,17,,Egyptian,Exit
21935,Antony and Cleopatra,18,5.1.72,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Come hither, Proculeius. Go and say,"
21936,Antony and Cleopatra,18,5.1.73,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,We purpose her no shame: give her what comforts
21937,Antony and Cleopatra,18,5.1.74,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"The quality of her passion shall require,"
21938,Antony and Cleopatra,18,5.1.75,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Lest, in her greatness, by some mortal stroke"
21939,Antony and Cleopatra,18,5.1.76,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"She do defeat us, for her life in Rome"
21940,Antony and Cleopatra,18,5.1.77,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Would be eternal in our triumph: go,"
21941,Antony and Cleopatra,18,5.1.78,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"And with your speediest bring us what she says,"
21942,Antony and Cleopatra,18,5.1.79,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,And how you find of her.
21943,Antony and Cleopatra,19,5.1.80,PROCULEIUS,"Caesar, I shall."
21944,Antony and Cleopatra,19,,PROCULEIUS,Exit
21945,Antony and Cleopatra,20,5.1.81,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Gallus, go you along."
21946,Antony and Cleopatra,20,,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,Exit GALLUS
21947,Antony and Cleopatra,20,5.1.82,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Where's Dolabella,"
21948,Antony and Cleopatra,20,5.1.83,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,To second Proculeius?
21949,Antony and Cleopatra,21,5.1.84,All,Dolabella!
21950,Antony and Cleopatra,22,5.1.85,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Let him alone, for I remember now"
21951,Antony and Cleopatra,22,5.1.86,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,How he's employ'd: he shall in time be ready.
21952,Antony and Cleopatra,22,5.1.87,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Go with me to my tent, where you shall see"
21953,Antony and Cleopatra,22,5.1.88,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"How hardly I was drawn into this war,"
21954,Antony and Cleopatra,22,5.1.89,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,How calm and gentle I proceeded still
21955,Antony and Cleopatra,22,5.1.90,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"In all my writings: go with me, and see"
21956,Antony and Cleopatra,22,5.1.91,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,What I can show in this.
21957,Antony and Cleopatra,22,,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,Exeunt
21958,Antony and Cleopatra,22,,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,SCENE II. Alexandria. A room in the monument.
21959,Antony and Cleopatra,22,,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Enter CLEOPATRA, CHARMIAN, and IRAS"
21960,Antony and Cleopatra,1,5.2.1,CLEOPATRA,My desolation does begin to make
21961,Antony and Cleopatra,1,5.2.2,CLEOPATRA,"A better life. 'Tis paltry to be Caesar,"
21962,Antony and Cleopatra,1,5.2.3,CLEOPATRA,"Not being Fortune, he's but Fortune's knave,"
21963,Antony and Cleopatra,1,5.2.4,CLEOPATRA,A minister of her will: and it is great
21964,Antony and Cleopatra,1,5.2.5,CLEOPATRA,"To do that thing that ends all other deeds,"
21965,Antony and Cleopatra,1,5.2.6,CLEOPATRA,"Which shackles accidents and bolts up change,"
21966,Antony and Cleopatra,1,5.2.7,CLEOPATRA,"Which sleeps, and never palates more the dug,"
21967,Antony and Cleopatra,1,5.2.8,CLEOPATRA,The beggar's nurse and Caesar's.
21968,Antony and Cleopatra,1,,CLEOPATRA,"Enter, to the gates of the monument, PROCULEIUS, GALLUS and Soldiers"
21969,Antony and Cleopatra,2,5.2.9,PROCULEIUS,"Caesar sends greeting to the Queen of Egypt,"
21970,Antony and Cleopatra,2,5.2.10,PROCULEIUS,And bids thee study on what fair demands
21971,Antony and Cleopatra,2,5.2.11,PROCULEIUS,Thou mean'st to have him grant thee.
21972,Antony and Cleopatra,3,5.2.12,CLEOPATRA,What's thy name?
21973,Antony and Cleopatra,4,5.2.13,PROCULEIUS,My name is Proculeius.
21974,Antony and Cleopatra,5,5.2.14,CLEOPATRA,Antony
21975,Antony and Cleopatra,5,5.2.15,CLEOPATRA,"Did tell me of you, bade me trust you, but"
21976,Antony and Cleopatra,5,5.2.16,CLEOPATRA,"I do not greatly care to be deceived,"
21977,Antony and Cleopatra,5,5.2.17,CLEOPATRA,That have no use for trusting. If your master
21978,Antony and Cleopatra,5,5.2.18,CLEOPATRA,"Would have a queen his beggar, you must tell him,"
21979,Antony and Cleopatra,5,5.2.19,CLEOPATRA,"That majesty, to keep decorum, must"
21980,Antony and Cleopatra,5,5.2.20,CLEOPATRA,No less beg than a kingdom: if he please

21982,Antony and Cleopatra,5,5.2.22,CLEOPATRA,"He gives me so much of mine own, as I"
21983,Antony and Cleopatra,5,5.2.23,CLEOPATRA,Will kneel to him with thanks.

21987,Antony and Cleopatra,6,5.2.27,PROCULEIUS,"Who is so full of grace, that it flows over"
21988,Antony and Cleopatra,6,5.2.28,PROCULEIUS,On all that need: let me report to him
21989,Antony and Cleopatra,6,5.2.29,PROCULEIUS,"Your sweet dependency, and you shall find"
21990,Antony and Cleopatra,6,5.2.30,PROCULEIUS,"A conqueror that will pray in aid for kindness,"
21991,Antony and Cleopatra,6,5.2.31,PROCULEIUS,Where he for grace is kneel'd to.
21992,Antony and Cleopatra,7,5.2.32,CLEOPATRA,"Pray you, tell him"
21993,Antony and Cleopatra,7,5.2.33,CLEOPATRA,"I am his fortune's vassal, and I send him"
21994,Antony and Cleopatra,7,5.2.34,CLEOPATRA,The greatness he has got. I hourly learn
21995,Antony and Cleopatra,7,5.2.35,CLEOPATRA,"A doctrine of obedience, and would gladly"
21996,Antony and Cleopatra,7,5.2.36,CLEOPATRA,Look him i' the face.
21997,Antony and Cleopatra,8,5.2.37,PROCULEIUS,"This I'll report, dear lady."
21998,Antony and Cleopatra,8,5.2.38,PROCULEIUS,"Have comfort, for I know your plight is pitied"
21999,Antony and Cleopatra,8,5.2.39,PROCULEIUS,Of him that caused it.
22000,Antony and Cleopatra,9,5.2.40,GALLUS,You see how easily she may be surprised:
22001,Antony and Cleopatra,9,,GALLUS,"Here PROCULEIUS and two of the Guard ascend the  monument by a ladder placed against a window, and,  having descended, come behind CLEOPATRA. Some of the Guard unbar and open the gates"
22002,Antony and Cleopatra,9,,GALLUS,To PROCULEIUS and the Guard
22003,Antony and Cleopatra,9,5.2.41,GALLUS,Guard her till Caesar come.
22004,Antony and Cleopatra,9,,GALLUS,Exit
22005,Antony and Cleopatra,10,5.2.42,IRAS,Royal queen!
22006,Antony and Cleopatra,11,5.2.43,CHARMIAN,"O Cleopatra! thou art taken, queen:"
22007,Antony and Cleopatra,12,5.2.44,CLEOPATRA,"Quick, quick, good hands."
22008,Antony and Cleopatra,12,,CLEOPATRA,Drawing a dagger
22009,Antony and Cleopatra,13,5.2.45,PROCULEIUS,"Hold, worthy lady, hold:"
22010,Antony and Cleopatra,13,,PROCULEIUS,Seizes and disarms her
22011,Antony and Cleopatra,13,5.2.46,PROCULEIUS,"Do not yourself such wrong, who are in this"
22012,Antony and Cleopatra,13,5.2.47,PROCULEIUS,"Relieved, but not betray'd."
22013,Antony and Cleopatra,14,5.2.48,CLEOPATRA,"What, of death too,"
22014,Antony and Cleopatra,14,5.2.49,CLEOPATRA,That rids our dogs of languish?
22015,Antony and Cleopatra,15,5.2.50,PROCULEIUS,"Cleopatra,"
22016,Antony and Cleopatra,15,5.2.51,PROCULEIUS,Do not abuse my master's bounty by
22017,Antony and Cleopatra,15,5.2.52,PROCULEIUS,The undoing of yourself: let the world see
22018,Antony and Cleopatra,15,5.2.53,PROCULEIUS,"His nobleness well acted, which your death"
22019,Antony and Cleopatra,15,5.2.54,PROCULEIUS,Will never let come forth.
22020,Antony and Cleopatra,16,5.2.55,CLEOPATRA,"Where art thou, death?"
22021,Antony and Cleopatra,16,5.2.56,CLEOPATRA,"Come hither, come! come, come, and take a queen"
22022,Antony and Cleopatra,16,5.2.57,CLEOPATRA,Worthy many babes and beggars!
22023,Antony and Cleopatra,17,5.2.58,PROCULEIUS,"O, temperance, lady!"
22024,Antony and Cleopatra,18,5.2.59,CLEOPATRA,"Sir, I will eat no meat, I'll not drink, sir,"
22025,Antony and Cleopatra,18,5.2.60,CLEOPATRA,"If idle talk will once be necessary,"
22026,Antony and Cleopatra,18,5.2.61,CLEOPATRA,"I'll not sleep neither: this mortal house I'll ruin,"
22027,Antony and Cleopatra,18,5.2.62,CLEOPATRA,"Do Caesar what he can. Know, sir, that I"
22028,Antony and Cleopatra,18,5.2.63,CLEOPATRA,"Will not wait pinion'd at your master's court,"
22029,Antony and Cleopatra,18,5.2.64,CLEOPATRA,Nor once be chastised with the sober eye
22030,Antony and Cleopatra,18,5.2.65,CLEOPATRA,Of dull Octavia. Shall they hoist me up
22031,Antony and Cleopatra,18,5.2.66,CLEOPATRA,And show me to the shouting varletry
22032,Antony and Cleopatra,18,5.2.67,CLEOPATRA,Of censuring Rome? Rather a ditch in Egypt
22033,Antony and Cleopatra,18,5.2.68,CLEOPATRA,Be gentle grave unto me! rather on Nilus' mud
22034,Antony and Cleopatra,18,5.2.69,CLEOPATRA,"Lay me stark naked, and let the water-flies"
22035,Antony and Cleopatra,18,5.2.70,CLEOPATRA,Blow me into abhorring! rather make
22036,Antony and Cleopatra,18,5.2.71,CLEOPATRA,"My country's high pyramides my gibbet,"
22037,Antony and Cleopatra,18,5.2.72,CLEOPATRA,And hang me up in chains!
22038,Antony and Cleopatra,19,5.2.73,PROCULEIUS,You do extend
22039,Antony and Cleopatra,19,5.2.74,PROCULEIUS,These thoughts of horror further than you shall
22040,Antony and Cleopatra,19,5.2.75,PROCULEIUS,Find cause in Caesar.
22041,Antony and Cleopatra,19,,PROCULEIUS,Enter DOLABELLA
22042,Antony and Cleopatra,20,5.2.76,DOLABELLA,"Proculeius,"
22043,Antony and Cleopatra,20,5.2.77,DOLABELLA,"What thou hast done thy master Caesar knows,"
22044,Antony and Cleopatra,20,5.2.78,DOLABELLA,"And he hath sent for thee: for the queen,"
22045,Antony and Cleopatra,20,5.2.79,DOLABELLA,I'll take her to my guard.
22046,Antony and Cleopatra,21,5.2.80,PROCULEIUS,"So, Dolabella,"
22047,Antony and Cleopatra,21,5.2.81,PROCULEIUS,It shall content me best: be gentle to her.
22048,Antony and Cleopatra,21,,PROCULEIUS,To CLEOPATRA
22049,Antony and Cleopatra,21,5.2.82,PROCULEIUS,"To Caesar I will speak what you shall please,"
22050,Antony and Cleopatra,21,5.2.83,PROCULEIUS,If you'll employ me to him.
22051,Antony and Cleopatra,22,5.2.84,CLEOPATRA,"Say, I would die."
22052,Antony and Cleopatra,22,,CLEOPATRA,Exeunt PROCULEIUS and Soldiers
22053,Antony and Cleopatra,23,5.2.85,DOLABELLA,"Most noble empress, you have heard of me?"
22054,Antony and Cleopatra,24,5.2.86,CLEOPATRA,I cannot tell.
22055,Antony and Cleopatra,25,5.2.87,DOLABELLA,Assuredly you know me.
22056,Antony and Cleopatra,26,5.2.88,CLEOPATRA,"No matter, sir, what I have heard or known."
22057,Antony and Cleopatra,26,5.2.89,CLEOPATRA,"You laugh when boys or women tell their dreams,"
22058,Antony and Cleopatra,26,5.2.90,CLEOPATRA,Is't not your trick?
22059,Antony and Cleopatra,27,5.2.91,DOLABELLA,"I understand not, madam."
22060,Antony and Cleopatra,28,5.2.92,CLEOPATRA,I dream'd there was an Emperor Antony:
22061,Antony and Cleopatra,28,5.2.93,CLEOPATRA,"O, such another sleep, that I might see"
22062,Antony and Cleopatra,28,5.2.94,CLEOPATRA,But such another man!
22063,Antony and Cleopatra,29,5.2.95,DOLABELLA,"If it might please ye,--"
22064,Antony and Cleopatra,30,5.2.96,CLEOPATRA,"His face was as the heavens, and therein stuck"
22065,Antony and Cleopatra,30,5.2.97,CLEOPATRA,"A sun and moon, which kept their course,"
22066,Antony and Cleopatra,30,5.2.98,CLEOPATRA,and lighted
22067,Antony and Cleopatra,30,5.2.99,CLEOPATRA,"The little O, the earth."
22068,Antony and Cleopatra,31,5.2.100,DOLABELLA,"Most sovereign creature,--"
22069,Antony and Cleopatra,32,5.2.101,CLEOPATRA,His legs bestrid the ocean: his rear'd arm
22070,Antony and Cleopatra,32,5.2.102,CLEOPATRA,Crested the world: his voice was propertied
22071,Antony and Cleopatra,32,5.2.103,CLEOPATRA,"As all the tuned spheres, and that to friends,"
22072,Antony and Cleopatra,32,5.2.104,CLEOPATRA,"But when he meant to quail and shake the orb,"
22073,Antony and Cleopatra,32,5.2.105,CLEOPATRA,"He was as rattling thunder. For his bounty,"
22074,Antony and Cleopatra,32,5.2.106,CLEOPATRA,"There was no winter in't, an autumn 'twas"
22075,Antony and Cleopatra,32,5.2.107,CLEOPATRA,That grew the more by reaping: his delights
22076,Antony and Cleopatra,32,5.2.108,CLEOPATRA,"Were dolphin-like, they show'd his back above"
22077,Antony and Cleopatra,32,5.2.109,CLEOPATRA,The element they lived in: in his livery
22078,Antony and Cleopatra,32,5.2.110,CLEOPATRA,"Walk'd crowns and crownets, realms and islands were"
22079,Antony and Cleopatra,32,5.2.111,CLEOPATRA,As plates dropp'd from his pocket.
22080,Antony and Cleopatra,33,5.2.112,DOLABELLA,Cleopatra!
22081,Antony and Cleopatra,34,5.2.113,CLEOPATRA,"Think you there was, or might be, such a man"
22082,Antony and Cleopatra,34,5.2.114,CLEOPATRA,As this I dream'd of?
22083,Antony and Cleopatra,35,5.2.115,DOLABELLA,"Gentle madam, no."
22084,Antony and Cleopatra,36,5.2.116,CLEOPATRA,"You lie, up to the hearing of the gods."
22085,Antony and Cleopatra,36,5.2.117,CLEOPATRA,"But, if there be, or ever were, one such,"
22086,Antony and Cleopatra,36,5.2.118,CLEOPATRA,It's past the size of dreaming: nature wants stuff
22087,Antony and Cleopatra,36,5.2.119,CLEOPATRA,"To vie strange forms with fancy, yet, to imagine"
22088,Antony and Cleopatra,36,5.2.120,CLEOPATRA,"And Antony, were nature's piece 'gainst fancy,"
22089,Antony and Cleopatra,36,5.2.121,CLEOPATRA,Condemning shadows quite.
22090,Antony and Cleopatra,37,5.2.122,DOLABELLA,"Hear me, good madam."
22091,Antony and Cleopatra,37,5.2.123,DOLABELLA,"Your loss is as yourself, great, and you bear it"
22092,Antony and Cleopatra,37,5.2.124,DOLABELLA,As answering to the weight: would I might never
22093,Antony and Cleopatra,37,5.2.125,DOLABELLA,"O'ertake pursued success, but I do feel,"
22094,Antony and Cleopatra,37,5.2.126,DOLABELLA,"By the rebound of yours, a grief that smites"
22095,Antony and Cleopatra,37,5.2.127,DOLABELLA,My very heart at root.
22096,Antony and Cleopatra,38,5.2.128,CLEOPATRA,"I thank you, sir,"
22097,Antony and Cleopatra,38,5.2.129,CLEOPATRA,Know you what Caesar means to do with me?
22098,Antony and Cleopatra,39,5.2.130,DOLABELLA,I am loath to tell you what I would you knew.
22099,Antony and Cleopatra,40,5.2.131,CLEOPATRA,"Nay, pray you, sir,--"
22100,Antony and Cleopatra,41,5.2.132,DOLABELLA,"Though he be honourable,--"
22101,Antony and Cleopatra,42,5.2.133,CLEOPATRA,"He'll lead me, then, in triumph?"
22102,Antony and Cleopatra,43,5.2.134,DOLABELLA,"Madam, he will, I know't."
22103,Antony and Cleopatra,43,5.2.134,DOLABELLA,"Flourish, and shout within, 'Make way there: Octavius Caesar!'"
22104,Antony and Cleopatra,43,,DOLABELLA,"Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, GALLUS, PROCULEIUS, MECAENAS, SELEUCUS, and others of his Train"
22105,Antony and Cleopatra,44,5.2.135,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,Which is the Queen of Egypt?
22106,Antony and Cleopatra,45,5.2.136,DOLABELLA,"It is the emperor, madam."
22107,Antony and Cleopatra,45,,DOLABELLA,CLEOPATRA kneels
22108,Antony and Cleopatra,46,5.2.137,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Arise, you shall not kneel:"
22109,Antony and Cleopatra,46,5.2.138,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"I pray you, rise, rise, Egypt."
22110,Antony and Cleopatra,47,5.2.139,CLEOPATRA,"Sir, the gods"
22111,Antony and Cleopatra,47,5.2.140,CLEOPATRA,"Will have it thus, my master and my lord"
22112,Antony and Cleopatra,47,5.2.141,CLEOPATRA,I must obey.
22113,Antony and Cleopatra,48,5.2.142,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,Take to you no hard thoughts:
22114,Antony and Cleopatra,48,5.2.143,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"The record of what injuries you did us,"
22115,Antony and Cleopatra,48,5.2.144,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Though written in our flesh, we shall remember"
22116,Antony and Cleopatra,48,5.2.145,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,As things but done by chance.
22117,Antony and Cleopatra,49,5.2.146,CLEOPATRA,"Sole sir o' the world,"
22118,Antony and Cleopatra,49,5.2.147,CLEOPATRA,I cannot project mine own cause so well
22119,Antony and Cleopatra,49,5.2.148,CLEOPATRA,"To make it clear, but do confess I have"
22120,Antony and Cleopatra,49,5.2.149,CLEOPATRA,Been laden with like frailties which before
22121,Antony and Cleopatra,49,5.2.150,CLEOPATRA,Have often shamed our sex.
22122,Antony and Cleopatra,50,5.2.151,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Cleopatra, know,"
22123,Antony and Cleopatra,50,5.2.152,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,We will extenuate rather than enforce:
22124,Antony and Cleopatra,50,5.2.153,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"If you apply yourself to our intents,"
22125,Antony and Cleopatra,50,5.2.154,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Which towards you are most gentle, you shall find"
22126,Antony and Cleopatra,50,5.2.155,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"A benefit in this change, but if you seek"
22127,Antony and Cleopatra,50,5.2.156,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"To lay on me a cruelty, by taking"
22128,Antony and Cleopatra,50,5.2.157,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Antony's course, you shall bereave yourself"
22129,Antony and Cleopatra,50,5.2.158,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Of my good purposes, and put your children"
22130,Antony and Cleopatra,50,5.2.159,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"To that destruction which I'll guard them from,"
22131,Antony and Cleopatra,50,5.2.160,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,If thereon you rely. I'll take my leave.
22132,Antony and Cleopatra,51,5.2.161,CLEOPATRA,"And may, through all the world: 'tis yours, and we,"
22133,Antony and Cleopatra,51,5.2.162,CLEOPATRA,"Your scutcheons and your signs of conquest, shall"
22134,Antony and Cleopatra,51,5.2.163,CLEOPATRA,"Hang in what place you please. Here, my good lord."
22135,Antony and Cleopatra,52,5.2.164,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,You shall advise me in all for Cleopatra.
22136,Antony and Cleopatra,53,5.2.165,CLEOPATRA,"This is the brief of money, plate, and jewels,"
22137,Antony and Cleopatra,53,5.2.166,CLEOPATRA,"I am possess'd of: 'tis exactly valued,"
22138,Antony and Cleopatra,53,5.2.167,CLEOPATRA,Not petty things admitted. Where's Seleucus?
22139,Antony and Cleopatra,54,5.2.168,SELEUCUS,"Here, madam."
22140,Antony and Cleopatra,55,5.2.169,CLEOPATRA,"This is my treasurer: let him speak, my lord,"
22141,Antony and Cleopatra,55,5.2.170,CLEOPATRA,"Upon his peril, that I have reserved"
22142,Antony and Cleopatra,55,5.2.171,CLEOPATRA,"To myself nothing. Speak the truth, Seleucus."
22143,Antony and Cleopatra,56,5.2.172,SELEUCUS,"Madam,"
22144,Antony and Cleopatra,56,5.2.173,SELEUCUS,"I had rather seal my lips, than, to my peril,"
22145,Antony and Cleopatra,56,5.2.174,SELEUCUS,Speak that which is not.
22146,Antony and Cleopatra,57,5.2.175,CLEOPATRA,What have I kept back?
22147,Antony and Cleopatra,58,5.2.176,SELEUCUS,Enough to purchase what you have made known.
22148,Antony and Cleopatra,59,5.2.177,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Nay, blush not, Cleopatra, I approve"
22149,Antony and Cleopatra,59,5.2.178,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,Your wisdom in the deed.
22150,Antony and Cleopatra,60,5.2.179,CLEOPATRA,"See, Caesar! O, behold,"
22151,Antony and Cleopatra,60,5.2.180,CLEOPATRA,"How pomp is follow'd! mine will now be yours,"
22152,Antony and Cleopatra,60,5.2.181,CLEOPATRA,"And, should we shift estates, yours would be mine."
22153,Antony and Cleopatra,60,5.2.182,CLEOPATRA,The ingratitude of this Seleucus does
22154,Antony and Cleopatra,60,5.2.183,CLEOPATRA,"Even make me wild: O slave, of no more trust"
22155,Antony and Cleopatra,60,5.2.184,CLEOPATRA,"Than love that's hired! What, goest thou back? thou shalt"
22156,Antony and Cleopatra,60,5.2.185,CLEOPATRA,"Go back, I warrant thee, but I'll catch thine eyes,"
22157,Antony and Cleopatra,60,5.2.186,CLEOPATRA,"Though they had wings: slave, soulless villain, dog!"
22158,Antony and Cleopatra,60,5.2.187,CLEOPATRA,O rarely base!
22159,Antony and Cleopatra,61,5.2.188,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Good queen, let us entreat you."
22160,Antony and Cleopatra,62,5.2.189,CLEOPATRA,"O Caesar, what a wounding shame is this,"
22161,Antony and Cleopatra,62,5.2.190,CLEOPATRA,"That thou, vouchsafing here to visit me,"
22162,Antony and Cleopatra,62,5.2.191,CLEOPATRA,Doing the honour of thy lordliness
22163,Antony and Cleopatra,62,5.2.192,CLEOPATRA,"To one so meek, that mine own servant should"
22164,Antony and Cleopatra,62,5.2.193,CLEOPATRA,Parcel the sum of my disgraces by
22165,Antony and Cleopatra,62,5.2.194,CLEOPATRA,"Addition of his envy! Say, good Caesar,"
22166,Antony and Cleopatra,62,5.2.195,CLEOPATRA,"That I some lady trifles have reserved,"
22167,Antony and Cleopatra,62,5.2.196,CLEOPATRA,"Immoment toys, things of such dignity"
22168,Antony and Cleopatra,62,5.2.197,CLEOPATRA,"As we greet modern friends withal, and say,"
22169,Antony and Cleopatra,62,5.2.198,CLEOPATRA,Some nobler token I have kept apart
22170,Antony and Cleopatra,62,5.2.199,CLEOPATRA,"For Livia and Octavia, to induce"
22171,Antony and Cleopatra,62,5.2.200,CLEOPATRA,"Their mediation, must I be unfolded"
22172,Antony and Cleopatra,62,5.2.201,CLEOPATRA,With one that I have bred? The gods! it smites me
22173,Antony and Cleopatra,62,5.2.202,CLEOPATRA,Beneath the fall I have.
22174,Antony and Cleopatra,62,,CLEOPATRA,To SELEUCUS
22175,Antony and Cleopatra,62,5.2.203,CLEOPATRA,"Prithee, go hence,"
22176,Antony and Cleopatra,62,5.2.204,CLEOPATRA,Or I shall show the cinders of my spirits
22177,Antony and Cleopatra,62,5.2.205,CLEOPATRA,"Through the ashes of my chance: wert thou a man,"
22178,Antony and Cleopatra,62,5.2.206,CLEOPATRA,Thou wouldst have mercy on me.
22179,Antony and Cleopatra,63,5.2.207,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Forbear, Seleucus."
22180,Antony and Cleopatra,63,,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,Exit SELEUCUS
22181,Antony and Cleopatra,64,5.2.208,CLEOPATRA,"Be it known, that we, the greatest, are misthought"
22182,Antony and Cleopatra,64,5.2.209,CLEOPATRA,"For things that others do, and, when we fall,"
22183,Antony and Cleopatra,64,5.2.210,CLEOPATRA,"We answer others' merits in our name,"
22184,Antony and Cleopatra,64,5.2.211,CLEOPATRA,Are therefore to be pitied.
22185,Antony and Cleopatra,65,5.2.212,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Cleopatra,"
22186,Antony and Cleopatra,65,5.2.213,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Not what you have reserved, nor what acknowledged,"
22187,Antony and Cleopatra,65,5.2.214,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Put we i' the roll of conquest: still be't yours,"
22188,Antony and Cleopatra,65,5.2.215,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Bestow it at your pleasure, and believe,"
22189,Antony and Cleopatra,65,5.2.216,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Caesar's no merchant, to make prize with you"
22190,Antony and Cleopatra,65,5.2.217,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Of things that merchants sold. Therefore be cheer'd,"
22191,Antony and Cleopatra,65,5.2.218,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Make not your thoughts your prisons: no, dear queen,"
22192,Antony and Cleopatra,65,5.2.219,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,For we intend so to dispose you as
22193,Antony and Cleopatra,65,5.2.220,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Yourself shall give us counsel. Feed, and sleep:"
22194,Antony and Cleopatra,65,5.2.221,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Our care and pity is so much upon you,"
22195,Antony and Cleopatra,65,5.2.222,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"That we remain your friend, and so, adieu."
22196,Antony and Cleopatra,66,5.2.223,CLEOPATRA,"My master, and my lord!"
22197,Antony and Cleopatra,67,5.2.224,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,Not so. Adieu.
22198,Antony and Cleopatra,67,,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,Flourish. Exeunt OCTAVIUS CAESAR and his train
22199,Antony and Cleopatra,68,5.2.225,CLEOPATRA,"He words me, girls, he words me, that I should not"
22200,Antony and Cleopatra,68,5.2.226,CLEOPATRA,"Be noble to myself: but, hark thee, Charmian."
22201,Antony and Cleopatra,68,,CLEOPATRA,Whispers CHARMIAN
22202,Antony and Cleopatra,69,5.2.227,IRAS,"Finish, good lady, the bright day is done,"
22203,Antony and Cleopatra,69,5.2.228,IRAS,And we are for the dark.

22217,Antony and Cleopatra,75,5.2.240,DOLABELLA,You with your children will he send before:

22219,Antony and Cleopatra,75,5.2.242,DOLABELLA,Your pleasure and my promise.
22220,Antony and Cleopatra,76,5.2.243,CLEOPATRA,"Dolabella,"

22226,Antony and Cleopatra,78,5.2.248,CLEOPATRA,"Now, Iras, what think'st thou?"
22227,Antony and Cleopatra,78,5.2.249,CLEOPATRA,"Thou, an Egyptian puppet, shalt be shown"
22228,Antony and Cleopatra,78,5.2.250,CLEOPATRA,"In Rome, as well as I	mechanic slaves"

22230,Antony and Cleopatra,78,5.2.252,CLEOPATRA,"Uplift us to the view, in their thick breaths,"
22231,Antony and Cleopatra,78,5.2.253,CLEOPATRA,"Rank of gross diet, shall be enclouded,"
22232,Antony and Cleopatra,78,5.2.254,CLEOPATRA,And forced to drink their vapour.
22233,Antony and Cleopatra,79,5.2.255,IRAS,The gods forbid!
22234,Antony and Cleopatra,80,5.2.256,CLEOPATRA,"Nay, 'tis most certain, Iras: saucy lictors"
22235,Antony and Cleopatra,80,5.2.257,CLEOPATRA,"Will catch at us, like strumpets, and scald rhymers"
22236,Antony and Cleopatra,80,5.2.258,CLEOPATRA,Ballad us out o' tune: the quick comedians

22243,Antony and Cleopatra,82,5.2.265,CLEOPATRA,"Nay, that's certain."
22244,Antony and Cleopatra,83,5.2.266,IRAS,"I'll never see 't, for, I am sure, my nails"
22245,Antony and Cleopatra,83,5.2.267,IRAS,Are stronger than mine eyes.
22246,Antony and Cleopatra,84,5.2.268,CLEOPATRA,"Why, that's the way"
22247,Antony and Cleopatra,84,5.2.269,CLEOPATRA,"To fool their preparation, and to conquer"
22248,Antony and Cleopatra,84,5.2.270,CLEOPATRA,Their most absurd intents.
22249,Antony and Cleopatra,84,,CLEOPATRA,Re-enter CHARMIAN
22250,Antony and Cleopatra,84,5.2.271,CLEOPATRA,"Now, Charmian!"
22251,Antony and Cleopatra,84,5.2.272,CLEOPATRA,"Show me, my women, like a queen: go fetch"
22252,Antony and Cleopatra,84,5.2.273,CLEOPATRA,"My best attires: I am again for Cydnus,"

22254,Antony and Cleopatra,84,5.2.275,CLEOPATRA,"Now, noble Charmian, we'll dispatch indeed,"
22255,Antony and Cleopatra,84,5.2.276,CLEOPATRA,"And, when thou hast done this chare, I'll give thee leave"
22256,Antony and Cleopatra,84,5.2.277,CLEOPATRA,To play till doomsday. Bring our crown and all.
22257,Antony and Cleopatra,84,5.2.278,CLEOPATRA,Wherefore's this noise?
22258,Antony and Cleopatra,84,,CLEOPATRA,Exit IRAS. A noise within
22259,Antony and Cleopatra,84,,CLEOPATRA,Enter a Guardsman
22260,Antony and Cleopatra,85,5.2.279,Guard,Here is a rural fellow
22261,Antony and Cleopatra,85,5.2.280,Guard,That will not be denied your highness presence:
22262,Antony and Cleopatra,85,5.2.281,Guard,He brings you figs.
22263,Antony and Cleopatra,86,5.2.282,CLEOPATRA,Let him come in.
22264,Antony and Cleopatra,86,,CLEOPATRA,Exit Guardsman
22265,Antony and Cleopatra,86,5.2.283,CLEOPATRA,What poor an instrument
22266,Antony and Cleopatra,86,5.2.284,CLEOPATRA,May do a noble deed! he brings me liberty.
22267,Antony and Cleopatra,86,5.2.285,CLEOPATRA,"My resolution's placed, and I have nothing"
22268,Antony and Cleopatra,86,5.2.286,CLEOPATRA,Of woman in me: now from head to foot
22269,Antony and Cleopatra,86,5.2.287,CLEOPATRA,"I am marble-constant, now the fleeting moon"
22270,Antony and Cleopatra,86,5.2.288,CLEOPATRA,No planet is of mine.
22271,Antony and Cleopatra,86,,CLEOPATRA,"Re-enter Guardsman, with Clown bringing in a basket"
22272,Antony and Cleopatra,87,5.2.289,Guard,This is the man.
22273,Antony and Cleopatra,88,5.2.290,CLEOPATRA,"Avoid, and leave him."

22276,Antony and Cleopatra,88,5.2.292,CLEOPATRA,That kills and pains not?
22277,Antony and Cleopatra,89,5.2.293,Clown,"Truly, I have him: but I would not be the party"
22278,Antony and Cleopatra,89,5.2.294,Clown,"that should desire you to touch him, for his biting"
22279,Antony and Cleopatra,89,5.2.295,Clown,"is immortal, those that do die of it do seldom or"
22280,Antony and Cleopatra,89,5.2.296,Clown,never recover.
22281,Antony and Cleopatra,90,5.2.297,CLEOPATRA,Rememberest thou any that have died on't?
22282,Antony and Cleopatra,91,5.2.298,Clown,"Very many, men and women too. I heard of one of"
22283,Antony and Cleopatra,91,5.2.299,Clown,"them no longer than yesterday: a very honest woman,"
22284,Antony and Cleopatra,91,5.2.300,Clown,"but something given to lie, as a woman should not"
22285,Antony and Cleopatra,91,5.2.301,Clown,"do, but in the way of honesty: how she died of the"
22286,Antony and Cleopatra,91,5.2.302,Clown,"biting of it, what pain she felt: truly, she makes"
22287,Antony and Cleopatra,91,5.2.303,Clown,"a very good report o' the worm, but he that will"
22288,Antony and Cleopatra,91,5.2.304,Clown,"believe all that they say, shall never be saved by"
22289,Antony and Cleopatra,91,5.2.305,Clown,"half that they do: but this is most fallible, the"
22290,Antony and Cleopatra,91,5.2.306,Clown,worm's an odd worm.
22291,Antony and Cleopatra,92,5.2.307,CLEOPATRA,"Get thee hence, farewell."
22292,Antony and Cleopatra,93,5.2.308,Clown,I wish you all joy of the worm.
22293,Antony and Cleopatra,93,,Clown,Setting down his basket
22294,Antony and Cleopatra,94,5.2.309,CLEOPATRA,Farewell.
22295,Antony and Cleopatra,95,5.2.310,Clown,"You must think this, look you, that the worm will"
22296,Antony and Cleopatra,95,5.2.311,Clown,do his kind.
22297,Antony and Cleopatra,96,5.2.312,CLEOPATRA,"Ay, ay, farewell."
22298,Antony and Cleopatra,97,5.2.313,Clown,"Look you, the worm is not to be trusted but in the"
22299,Antony and Cleopatra,97,5.2.314,Clown,"keeping of wise people, for, indeed, there is no"
22300,Antony and Cleopatra,97,5.2.315,Clown,goodness in worm.
22301,Antony and Cleopatra,98,5.2.316,CLEOPATRA,"Take thou no care, it shall be heeded."
22302,Antony and Cleopatra,99,5.2.317,Clown,"Very good. Give it nothing, I pray you, for it is"
22303,Antony and Cleopatra,99,5.2.318,Clown,not worth the feeding.
22304,Antony and Cleopatra,100,5.2.319,CLEOPATRA,Will it eat me?
22305,Antony and Cleopatra,101,5.2.320,Clown,You must not think I am so simple but I know the
22306,Antony and Cleopatra,101,5.2.321,Clown,devil himself will not eat a woman: I know that a
22307,Antony and Cleopatra,101,5.2.322,Clown,"woman is a dish for the gods, if the devil dress her"
22308,Antony and Cleopatra,101,5.2.323,Clown,"not. But, truly, these same whoreson devils do the"
22309,Antony and Cleopatra,101,5.2.324,Clown,"gods great harm in their women, for in every ten"
22310,Antony and Cleopatra,101,5.2.325,Clown,"that they make, the devils mar five."
22311,Antony and Cleopatra,102,5.2.326,CLEOPATRA,"Well, get thee gone, farewell."
22312,Antony and Cleopatra,103,5.2.327,Clown,"Yes, forsooth: I wish you joy o' the worm."

22325,Antony and Cleopatra,104,5.2.338,CLEOPATRA,"I give to baser life. So, have you done?"
22326,Antony and Cleopatra,104,5.2.339,CLEOPATRA,"Come then, and take the last warmth of my lips."
22327,Antony and Cleopatra,104,5.2.340,CLEOPATRA,"Farewell, kind Charmian, Iras, long farewell."
22328,Antony and Cleopatra,104,,CLEOPATRA,Kisses them. IRAS falls and dies
22329,Antony and Cleopatra,104,5.2.341,CLEOPATRA,Have I the aspic in my lips? Dost fall?

22331,Antony and Cleopatra,104,5.2.343,CLEOPATRA,"The stroke of death is as a lover's pinch,"
22332,Antony and Cleopatra,104,5.2.344,CLEOPATRA,"Which hurts, and is desired. Dost thou lie still?"
22333,Antony and Cleopatra,104,5.2.345,CLEOPATRA,"If thus thou vanishest, thou tell'st the world"
22334,Antony and Cleopatra,104,5.2.346,CLEOPATRA,It is not worth leave-taking.
22335,Antony and Cleopatra,105,5.2.347,CHARMIAN,"Dissolve, thick cloud, and rain, that I may say,"
22336,Antony and Cleopatra,105,5.2.348,CHARMIAN,The gods themselves do weep!
22337,Antony and Cleopatra,106,5.2.349,CLEOPATRA,This proves me base:
22338,Antony and Cleopatra,106,5.2.350,CLEOPATRA,"If she first meet the curled Antony,"
22339,Antony and Cleopatra,106,5.2.351,CLEOPATRA,"He'll make demand of her, and spend that kiss"
22340,Antony and Cleopatra,106,5.2.352,CLEOPATRA,"Which is my heaven to have. Come, thou"

22346,Antony and Cleopatra,106,5.2.357,CLEOPATRA,That I might hear thee call great Caesar ass
22347,Antony and Cleopatra,106,5.2.358,CLEOPATRA,Unpolicied!
22348,Antony and Cleopatra,107,5.2.359,CHARMIAN,O eastern star!

22353,Antony and Cleopatra,110,5.2.364,CLEOPATRA,"As sweet as balm, as soft as air, as gentle,--"

22355,Antony and Cleopatra,110,,CLEOPATRA,Applying another asp to her arm
22356,Antony and Cleopatra,110,5.2.366,CLEOPATRA,What should I stay--

22371,Antony and Cleopatra,116,5.2.378,First Guard,"Approach, ho! All's not well: Caesar's beguiled."
22372,Antony and Cleopatra,117,5.2.379,Second Guard,"There's Dolabella sent from Caesar, call him."
22373,Antony and Cleopatra,118,5.2.380,First Guard,"What work is here! Charmian, is this well done?"
22374,Antony and Cleopatra,119,5.2.381,CHARMIAN,"It is well done, and fitting for a princess"
22375,Antony and Cleopatra,119,5.2.382,CHARMIAN,Descended of so many royal kings.
22376,Antony and Cleopatra,119,5.2.383,CHARMIAN,"Ah, soldier!"

22380,Antony and Cleopatra,121,5.2.385,Second Guard,All dead.

22389,Antony and Cleopatra,124,5.2.392,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Bravest at the last,"
22390,Antony and Cleopatra,124,5.2.393,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"She levell'd at our purposes, and, being royal,"
22391,Antony and Cleopatra,124,5.2.394,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,Took her own way. The manner of their deaths?
22392,Antony and Cleopatra,124,5.2.395,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,I do not see them bleed.
22393,Antony and Cleopatra,125,5.2.396,DOLABELLA,Who was last with them?
22394,Antony and Cleopatra,126,5.2.397,First Guard,"A simple countryman, that brought her figs:"
22395,Antony and Cleopatra,126,5.2.398,First Guard,This was his basket.
22396,Antony and Cleopatra,127,5.2.399,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Poison'd, then."
22397,Antony and Cleopatra,128,5.2.400,First Guard,"O Caesar,"
22398,Antony and Cleopatra,128,5.2.401,First Guard,"This Charmian lived but now, she stood and spake:"
22399,Antony and Cleopatra,128,5.2.402,First Guard,I found her trimming up the diadem
22400,Antony and Cleopatra,128,5.2.403,First Guard,"On her dead mistress, tremblingly she stood"
22401,Antony and Cleopatra,128,5.2.404,First Guard,And on the sudden dropp'd.

22405,Antony and Cleopatra,129,5.2.408,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,As she would catch another Antony
22406,Antony and Cleopatra,129,5.2.409,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,In her strong toil of grace.
22407,Antony and Cleopatra,130,5.2.410,DOLABELLA,"Here, on her breast,"
22408,Antony and Cleopatra,130,5.2.411,DOLABELLA,There is a vent of blood and something blown:
22409,Antony and Cleopatra,130,5.2.412,DOLABELLA,The like is on her arm.
22410,Antony and Cleopatra,131,5.2.413,First Guard,This is an aspic's trail: and these fig-leaves

22641,A Comedy of Errors,9,1.2.47,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,Return'd so soon! rather approach'd too late:

22717,A Comedy of Errors,1,2.1.2,ADRIANA,That in such haste I sent to seek his master!
22718,A Comedy of Errors,1,2.1.3,ADRIANA,"Sure, Luciana, it is two o'clock."
22719,A Comedy of Errors,2,2.1.4,LUCIANA,"Perhaps some merchant hath invited him,"
22720,A Comedy of Errors,2,2.1.5,LUCIANA,And from the mart he's somewhere gone to dinner.
22721,A Comedy of Errors,2,2.1.6,LUCIANA,"Good sister, let us dine and never fret:"
22722,A Comedy of Errors,2,2.1.7,LUCIANA,A man is master of his liberty:
22723,A Comedy of Errors,2,2.1.8,LUCIANA,"Time is their master, and, when they see time,"
22724,A Comedy of Errors,2,2.1.9,LUCIANA,"They'll go or come: if so, be patient, sister."
22725,A Comedy of Errors,3,2.1.10,ADRIANA,Why should their liberty than ours be more?
22726,A Comedy of Errors,4,2.1.11,LUCIANA,Because their business still lies out o' door.
22727,A Comedy of Errors,5,2.1.12,ADRIANA,"Look, when I serve him so, he takes it ill."
22728,A Comedy of Errors,6,2.1.13,LUCIANA,"O, know he is the bridle of your will."

22732,A Comedy of Errors,8,2.1.17,LUCIANA,"But hath his bound, in earth, in sea, in sky:"
22733,A Comedy of Errors,8,2.1.18,LUCIANA,"The beasts, the fishes, and the winged fowls,"
22734,A Comedy of Errors,8,2.1.19,LUCIANA,Are their males' subjects and at their controls:

22739,A Comedy of Errors,8,2.1.24,LUCIANA,"Are masters to their females, and their lords:"
22740,A Comedy of Errors,8,2.1.25,LUCIANA,Then let your will attend on their accords.
22741,A Comedy of Errors,9,2.1.26,ADRIANA,This servitude makes you to keep unwed.
22742,A Comedy of Errors,10,2.1.27,LUCIANA,"Not this, but troubles of the marriage-bed."
22743,A Comedy of Errors,11,2.1.28,ADRIANA,"But, were you wedded, you would bear some sway."
22744,A Comedy of Errors,12,2.1.29,LUCIANA,"Ere I learn love, I'll practise to obey."
22745,A Comedy of Errors,13,2.1.30,ADRIANA,How if your husband start some other where?
22746,A Comedy of Errors,14,2.1.31,LUCIANA,"Till he come home again, I would forbear."
22747,A Comedy of Errors,15,2.1.32,ADRIANA,"Patience unmoved! no marvel though she pause,"
22748,A Comedy of Errors,15,2.1.33,ADRIANA,They can be meek that have no other cause.
22749,A Comedy of Errors,15,2.1.34,ADRIANA,"A wretched soul, bruised with adversity,"
22750,A Comedy of Errors,15,2.1.35,ADRIANA,"We bid be quiet when we hear it cry,"
22751,A Comedy of Errors,15,2.1.36,ADRIANA,"But were we burdened with like weight of pain,"
22752,A Comedy of Errors,15,2.1.37,ADRIANA,As much or more would we ourselves complain:
22753,A Comedy of Errors,15,2.1.38,ADRIANA,"So thou, that hast no unkind mate to grieve thee,"
22754,A Comedy of Errors,15,2.1.39,ADRIANA,"With urging helpless patience wouldst relieve me,"
22755,A Comedy of Errors,15,2.1.40,ADRIANA,"But, if thou live to see like right bereft,"
22756,A Comedy of Errors,15,2.1.41,ADRIANA,This fool-begg'd patience in thee will be left.
22757,A Comedy of Errors,16,2.1.42,LUCIANA,"Well, I will marry one day, but to try."
22758,A Comedy of Errors,16,2.1.43,LUCIANA,"Here comes your man, now is your husband nigh."
22759,A Comedy of Errors,16,,LUCIANA,Enter DROMIO of Ephesus
22760,A Comedy of Errors,17,2.1.44,ADRIANA,"Say, is your tardy master now at hand?"
22761,A Comedy of Errors,18,2.1.45,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"Nay, he's at two hands with me, and that my two ears"
22762,A Comedy of Errors,18,2.1.46,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,can witness.
22763,A Comedy of Errors,19,2.1.47,ADRIANA,"Say, didst thou speak with him? know'st thou his mind?"
22764,A Comedy of Errors,20,2.1.48,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"Ay, ay, he told his mind upon mine ear:"
22765,A Comedy of Errors,20,2.1.49,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"Beshrew his hand, I scarce could understand it."
22766,A Comedy of Errors,21,2.1.50,LUCIANA,"Spake he so doubtfully, thou couldst not feel his meaning?"
22767,A Comedy of Errors,22,2.1.51,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"Nay, he struck so plainly, I could too well feel his"
22768,A Comedy of Errors,22,2.1.52,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"blows, and withal so doubtfully that I could scarce"
22769,A Comedy of Errors,22,2.1.53,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,understand them.
22770,A Comedy of Errors,23,2.1.54,ADRIANA,"But say, I prithee, is he coming home? It seems he"
22771,A Comedy of Errors,23,2.1.55,ADRIANA,hath great care to please his wife.
22772,A Comedy of Errors,24,2.1.56,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"Why, mistress, sure my master is horn-mad."
22773,A Comedy of Errors,25,2.1.57,ADRIANA,"Horn-mad, thou villain!"
22774,A Comedy of Errors,26,2.1.58,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"I mean not cuckold-mad,"
22775,A Comedy of Errors,26,2.1.59,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"But, sure, he is stark mad."
22776,A Comedy of Errors,26,2.1.60,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"When I desired him to come home to dinner,"
22777,A Comedy of Errors,26,2.1.61,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,He ask'd me for a thousand marks in gold:
22778,A Comedy of Errors,26,2.1.62,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"''Tis dinner-time,' quoth I, 'My gold!' quoth he,"
22779,A Comedy of Errors,26,2.1.63,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"'Your meat doth burn,' quoth I, 'My gold!' quoth he:"

22782,A Comedy of Errors,26,2.1.66,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"'The pig,' quoth I, 'is burn'd,' 'My gold!' quoth he:"

22784,A Comedy of Errors,26,2.1.68,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"I know not thy mistress, out on thy mistress!'"
22785,A Comedy of Errors,27,2.1.69,LUCIANA,Quoth who?
22786,A Comedy of Errors,28,2.1.70,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,Quoth my master:
22787,A Comedy of Errors,28,2.1.71,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"'I know,' quoth he, 'no house, no wife, no mistress.'"
22788,A Comedy of Errors,28,2.1.72,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"So that my errand, due unto my tongue,"
22789,A Comedy of Errors,28,2.1.73,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"I thank him, I bare home upon my shoulders,"
22790,A Comedy of Errors,28,2.1.74,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"For, in conclusion, he did beat me there."
22791,A Comedy of Errors,29,2.1.75,ADRIANA,"Go back again, thou slave, and fetch him home."
22792,A Comedy of Errors,30,2.1.76,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"Go back again, and be new beaten home?"
22793,A Comedy of Errors,30,2.1.77,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"For God's sake, send some other messenger."
22794,A Comedy of Errors,31,2.1.78,ADRIANA,"Back, slave, or I will break thy pate across."
22795,A Comedy of Errors,32,2.1.79,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,And he will bless that cross with other beating:
22796,A Comedy of Errors,32,2.1.80,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,Between you I shall have a holy head.
22797,A Comedy of Errors,33,2.1.81,ADRIANA,"Hence, prating peasant! fetch thy master home."
22798,A Comedy of Errors,34,2.1.82,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"Am I so round with you as you with me,"
22799,A Comedy of Errors,34,2.1.83,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,That like a football you do spurn me thus?
22800,A Comedy of Errors,34,2.1.84,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"You spurn me hence, and he will spurn me hither:"
22801,A Comedy of Errors,34,2.1.85,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"If I last in this service, you must case me in leather."
22802,A Comedy of Errors,34,,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,Exit
22803,A Comedy of Errors,35,2.1.86,LUCIANA,"Fie, how impatience loureth in your face!"
22804,A Comedy of Errors,36,2.1.87,ADRIANA,"His company must do his minions grace,"
22805,A Comedy of Errors,36,2.1.88,ADRIANA,Whilst I at home starve for a merry look.
22806,A Comedy of Errors,36,2.1.89,ADRIANA,Hath homely age the alluring beauty took
22807,A Comedy of Errors,36,2.1.90,ADRIANA,From my poor cheek? then he hath wasted it:
22808,A Comedy of Errors,36,2.1.91,ADRIANA,Are my discourses dull? barren my wit?
22809,A Comedy of Errors,36,2.1.92,ADRIANA,"If voluble and sharp discourse be marr'd,"
22810,A Comedy of Errors,36,2.1.93,ADRIANA,Unkindness blunts it more than marble hard:
22811,A Comedy of Errors,36,2.1.94,ADRIANA,Do their gay vestments his affections bait?
22812,A Comedy of Errors,36,2.1.95,ADRIANA,That's not my fault: he's master of my state:
22813,A Comedy of Errors,36,2.1.96,ADRIANA,"What ruins are in me that can be found,"
22814,A Comedy of Errors,36,2.1.97,ADRIANA,By him not ruin'd? then is he the ground
22815,A Comedy of Errors,36,2.1.98,ADRIANA,Of my defeatures. My decayed fair
22816,A Comedy of Errors,36,2.1.99,ADRIANA,A sunny look of his would soon repair
22817,A Comedy of Errors,36,2.1.100,ADRIANA,"But, too unruly deer, he breaks the pale"

22819,A Comedy of Errors,37,2.1.102,LUCIANA,"Self-harming jealousy! fie, beat it hence!"
22820,A Comedy of Errors,38,2.1.103,ADRIANA,Unfeeling fools can with such wrongs dispense.
22821,A Comedy of Errors,38,2.1.104,ADRIANA,"I know his eye doth homage otherwhere,"
22822,A Comedy of Errors,38,2.1.105,ADRIANA,Or else what lets it but he would be here?
22823,A Comedy of Errors,38,2.1.106,ADRIANA,"Sister, you know he promised me a chain,"
22824,A Comedy of Errors,38,2.1.107,ADRIANA,"Would that alone, alone he would detain,"
22825,A Comedy of Errors,38,2.1.108,ADRIANA,So he would keep fair quarter with his bed!
22826,A Comedy of Errors,38,2.1.109,ADRIANA,I see the jewel best enamelled
22827,A Comedy of Errors,38,2.1.110,ADRIANA,"Will lose his beauty, yet the gold bides still,"
22828,A Comedy of Errors,38,2.1.111,ADRIANA,"That others touch, and often touching will"

22830,A Comedy of Errors,38,2.1.113,ADRIANA,By falsehood and corruption doth it shame.
22831,A Comedy of Errors,38,2.1.114,ADRIANA,"Since that my beauty cannot please his eye,"

24056,A Comedy of Errors,15,5.1.42,ADRIANA,To fetch my poor distracted husband hence.
24057,A Comedy of Errors,15,5.1.43,ADRIANA,"Let us come in, that we may bind him fast"
24058,A Comedy of Errors,15,5.1.44,ADRIANA,And bear him home for his recovery.
24059,A Comedy of Errors,16,5.1.45,ANGELO,I knew he was not in his perfect wits.
24060,A Comedy of Errors,17,5.1.46,Second Merchant,I am sorry now that I did draw on him.
24061,A Comedy of Errors,18,5.1.47,AEMELIA,How long hath this possession held the man?
24062,A Comedy of Errors,19,5.1.48,ADRIANA,"This week he hath been heavy, sour, sad,"
24063,A Comedy of Errors,19,5.1.49,ADRIANA,"And much different from the man he was,"
24064,A Comedy of Errors,19,5.1.50,ADRIANA,But till this afternoon his passion
24065,A Comedy of Errors,19,5.1.51,ADRIANA,Ne'er brake into extremity of rage.
24066,A Comedy of Errors,20,5.1.52,AEMELIA,Hath he not lost much wealth by wreck of sea?
24067,A Comedy of Errors,20,5.1.53,AEMELIA,Buried some dear friend? Hath not else his eye
24068,A Comedy of Errors,20,5.1.54,AEMELIA,Stray'd his affection in unlawful love?
24069,A Comedy of Errors,20,5.1.55,AEMELIA,"A sin prevailing much in youthful men,"
24070,A Comedy of Errors,20,5.1.56,AEMELIA,Who give their eyes the liberty of gazing.
24071,A Comedy of Errors,20,5.1.57,AEMELIA,Which of these sorrows is he subject to?
24072,A Comedy of Errors,21,5.1.58,ADRIANA,"To none of these, except it be the last,"
24073,A Comedy of Errors,21,5.1.59,ADRIANA,"Namely, some love that drew him oft from home."
24074,A Comedy of Errors,22,5.1.60,AEMELIA,You should for that have reprehended him.
24075,A Comedy of Errors,23,5.1.61,ADRIANA,"Why, so I did."
24076,A Comedy of Errors,24,5.1.62,AEMELIA,"Ay, but not rough enough."
24077,A Comedy of Errors,25,5.1.63,ADRIANA,As roughly as my modesty would let me.
24078,A Comedy of Errors,26,5.1.64,AEMELIA,"Haply, in private."

24080,A Comedy of Errors,28,5.1.66,AEMELIA,"Ay, but not enough."
24081,A Comedy of Errors,29,5.1.67,ADRIANA,It was the copy of our conference:

24083,A Comedy of Errors,29,5.1.69,ADRIANA,"At board he fed not for my urging it,"
24084,A Comedy of Errors,29,5.1.70,ADRIANA,"Alone, it was the subject of my theme,"
24085,A Comedy of Errors,29,5.1.71,ADRIANA,"In company I often glanced it,"
24086,A Comedy of Errors,29,5.1.72,ADRIANA,Still did I tell him it was vile and bad.
24087,A Comedy of Errors,30,5.1.73,AEMELIA,And thereof came it that the man was mad.
24088,A Comedy of Errors,30,5.1.74,AEMELIA,The venom clamours of a jealous woman
24089,A Comedy of Errors,30,5.1.75,AEMELIA,Poisons more deadly than a mad dog's tooth.
24090,A Comedy of Errors,30,5.1.76,AEMELIA,"It seems his sleeps were hinder'd by thy railing,"
24091,A Comedy of Errors,30,5.1.77,AEMELIA,And therefore comes it that his head is light.
24092,A Comedy of Errors,30,5.1.78,AEMELIA,Thou say'st his meat was sauced with thy upbraidings:
24093,A Comedy of Errors,30,5.1.79,AEMELIA,"Unquiet meals make ill digestions,"
24094,A Comedy of Errors,30,5.1.80,AEMELIA,"Thereof the raging fire of fever bred,"
24095,A Comedy of Errors,30,5.1.81,AEMELIA,And what's a fever but a fit of madness?
24096,A Comedy of Errors,30,5.1.82,AEMELIA,Thou say'st his sports were hinderd by thy brawls:
24097,A Comedy of Errors,30,5.1.83,AEMELIA,"Sweet recreation barr'd, what doth ensue"
24098,A Comedy of Errors,30,5.1.84,AEMELIA,"But moody and dull melancholy,"
24099,A Comedy of Errors,30,5.1.85,AEMELIA,"Kinsman to grim and comfortless despair,"
24100,A Comedy of Errors,30,5.1.86,AEMELIA,And at her heels a huge infectious troop
24101,A Comedy of Errors,30,5.1.87,AEMELIA,Of pale distemperatures and foes to life?
24102,A Comedy of Errors,30,5.1.88,AEMELIA,"In food, in sport and life-preserving rest"
24103,A Comedy of Errors,30,5.1.89,AEMELIA,"To be disturb'd, would mad or man or beast:"
24104,A Comedy of Errors,30,5.1.90,AEMELIA,The consequence is then thy jealous fits
24105,A Comedy of Errors,30,5.1.91,AEMELIA,Have scared thy husband from the use of wits.
24106,A Comedy of Errors,31,5.1.92,LUCIANA,"She never reprehended him but mildly,"
24107,A Comedy of Errors,31,5.1.93,LUCIANA,"When he demean'd himself rough, rude and wildly."
24108,A Comedy of Errors,31,5.1.94,LUCIANA,Why bear you these rebukes and answer not?
24109,A Comedy of Errors,32,5.1.95,ADRIANA,She did betray me to my own reproof.
24110,A Comedy of Errors,32,5.1.96,ADRIANA,Good people enter and lay hold on him.
24111,A Comedy of Errors,33,5.1.97,AEMELIA,"No, not a creature enters in my house."
24112,A Comedy of Errors,34,5.1.98,ADRIANA,Then let your servants bring my husband forth.
24113,A Comedy of Errors,35,5.1.99,AEMELIA,"Neither: he took this place for sanctuary,"
24114,A Comedy of Errors,35,5.1.100,AEMELIA,And it shall privilege him from your hands
24115,A Comedy of Errors,35,5.1.101,AEMELIA,"Till I have brought him to his wits again,"
24116,A Comedy of Errors,35,5.1.102,AEMELIA,Or lose my labour in assaying it.
24117,A Comedy of Errors,36,5.1.103,ADRIANA,"I will attend my husband, be his nurse,"
24118,A Comedy of Errors,36,5.1.104,ADRIANA,"Diet his sickness, for it is my office,"
24119,A Comedy of Errors,36,5.1.105,ADRIANA,"And will have no attorney but myself,"
24120,A Comedy of Errors,36,5.1.106,ADRIANA,And therefore let me have him home with me.
24121,A Comedy of Errors,37,5.1.107,AEMELIA,"Be patient, for I will not let him stir"
24122,A Comedy of Errors,37,5.1.108,AEMELIA,"Till I have used the approved means I have,"
24123,A Comedy of Errors,37,5.1.109,AEMELIA,"With wholesome syrups, drugs and holy prayers,"
24124,A Comedy of Errors,37,5.1.110,AEMELIA,To make of him a formal man again:
24125,A Comedy of Errors,37,5.1.111,AEMELIA,"It is a branch and parcel of mine oath,"
24126,A Comedy of Errors,37,5.1.112,AEMELIA,A charitable duty of my order.
24127,A Comedy of Errors,37,5.1.113,AEMELIA,Therefore depart and leave him here with me.
24128,A Comedy of Errors,38,5.1.114,ADRIANA,I will not hence and leave my husband here:
24129,A Comedy of Errors,38,5.1.115,ADRIANA,And ill it doth beseem your holiness
24130,A Comedy of Errors,38,5.1.116,ADRIANA,To separate the husband and the wife.
24131,A Comedy of Errors,39,5.1.117,AEMELIA,Be quiet and depart: thou shalt not have him.
24132,A Comedy of Errors,39,,AEMELIA,Exit
24133,A Comedy of Errors,40,5.1.118,LUCIANA,Complain unto the duke of this indignity.

24136,A Comedy of Errors,41,5.1.121,ADRIANA,Have won his grace to come in person hither
24137,A Comedy of Errors,41,5.1.122,ADRIANA,And take perforce my husband from the abbess.
24138,A Comedy of Errors,42,5.1.123,Second Merchant,"By this, I think, the dial points at five:"
24139,A Comedy of Errors,42,5.1.124,Second Merchant,"Anon, I'm sure, the duke himself in person"
24140,A Comedy of Errors,42,5.1.125,Second Merchant,"Comes this way to the melancholy vale,"

24487,Coriolanus,2,1.1.2,All,"Speak, speak."
24488,Coriolanus,3,1.1.3,First Citizen,You are all resolved rather to die than to famish?

24496,Coriolanus,10,1.1.11,First Citizen,"We are accounted poor citizens, the patricians good."
24497,Coriolanus,10,1.1.12,First Citizen,What authority surfeits on would relieve us: if they
24498,Coriolanus,10,1.1.13,First Citizen,"would yield us but the superfluity, while it were"
24499,Coriolanus,10,1.1.14,First Citizen,"wholesome, we might guess they relieved us humanely,"
24500,Coriolanus,10,1.1.15,First Citizen,but they think we are too dear: the leanness that
24501,Coriolanus,10,1.1.16,First Citizen,"afflicts us, the object of our misery, is as an"
24502,Coriolanus,10,1.1.17,First Citizen,"inventory to particularise their abundance, our"
24503,Coriolanus,10,1.1.18,First Citizen,sufferance is a gain to them Let us revenge this with

24507,Coriolanus,12,1.1.22,All,Against him first: he's a very dog to the commonalty.
24508,Coriolanus,13,1.1.23,Second Citizen,Consider you what services he has done for his country?
24509,Coriolanus,14,1.1.24,First Citizen,"Very well, and could be content to give him good"

24515,Coriolanus,16,1.1.30,First Citizen,"please his mother and to be partly proud, which he"
24516,Coriolanus,16,1.1.31,First Citizen,"is, even till the altitude of his virtue."
24517,Coriolanus,17,1.1.32,Second Citizen,"What he cannot help in his nature, you account a"
24518,Coriolanus,17,1.1.33,Second Citizen,vice in him. You must in no way say he is covetous.

24525,Coriolanus,20,1.1.39,First Citizen,Soft! who comes here?

24531,Coriolanus,23,1.1.44,MENENIUS,"With bats and clubs? The matter? speak, I pray you."
24532,Coriolanus,24,1.1.45,First Citizen,"Our business is not unknown to the senate, they have"

24534,Coriolanus,24,1.1.47,First Citizen,which now we'll show 'em in deeds. They say poor
24535,Coriolanus,24,1.1.48,First Citizen,suitors have strong breaths: they shall know we
24536,Coriolanus,24,1.1.49,First Citizen,have strong arms too.
24537,Coriolanus,25,1.1.50,MENENIUS,"Why, masters, my good friends, mine honest neighbours,"
24538,Coriolanus,25,1.1.51,MENENIUS,Will you undo yourselves?
24539,Coriolanus,26,1.1.52,First Citizen,"We cannot, sir, we are undone already."
24540,Coriolanus,27,1.1.53,MENENIUS,"I tell you, friends, most charitable care"

24547,Coriolanus,27,1.1.60,MENENIUS,"Appear in your impediment. For the dearth,"
24548,Coriolanus,27,1.1.61,MENENIUS,"The gods, not the patricians, make it, and"
24549,Coriolanus,27,1.1.62,MENENIUS,"Your knees to them, not arms, must help. Alack,"
24550,Coriolanus,27,1.1.63,MENENIUS,You are transported by calamity
24551,Coriolanus,27,1.1.64,MENENIUS,"Thither where more attends you, and you slander"
24552,Coriolanus,27,1.1.65,MENENIUS,"The helms o' the state, who care for you like fathers,"
24553,Coriolanus,27,1.1.66,MENENIUS,When you curse them as enemies.
24554,Coriolanus,28,1.1.67,First Citizen,"Care for us! True, indeed! They ne'er cared for us"
24555,Coriolanus,28,1.1.68,First Citizen,"yet: suffer us to famish, and their store-houses"
24556,Coriolanus,28,1.1.69,First Citizen,"crammed with grain, make edicts for usury, to"
24557,Coriolanus,28,1.1.70,First Citizen,"support usurers, repeal daily any wholesome act"
24558,Coriolanus,28,1.1.71,First Citizen,"established against the rich, and provide more"
24559,Coriolanus,28,1.1.72,First Citizen,"piercing statutes daily, to chain up and restrain"
24560,Coriolanus,28,1.1.73,First Citizen,"the poor. If the wars eat us not up, they will, and"
24561,Coriolanus,28,1.1.74,First Citizen,there's all the love they bear us.
24562,Coriolanus,29,1.1.75,MENENIUS,Either you must
24563,Coriolanus,29,1.1.76,MENENIUS,"Confess yourselves wondrous malicious,"
24564,Coriolanus,29,1.1.77,MENENIUS,Or be accused of folly. I shall tell you
24565,Coriolanus,29,1.1.78,MENENIUS,"A pretty tale: it may be you have heard it,"
24566,Coriolanus,29,1.1.79,MENENIUS,"But, since it serves my purpose, I will venture"
24567,Coriolanus,29,1.1.80,MENENIUS,To stale 't a little more.
24568,Coriolanus,30,1.1.81,First Citizen,"Well, I'll hear it, sir: yet you must not think to"
24569,Coriolanus,30,1.1.82,First Citizen,"fob off our disgrace with a tale: but, an 't please"
24570,Coriolanus,30,1.1.83,First Citizen,"you, deliver."
24571,Coriolanus,31,1.1.84,MENENIUS,There was a time when all the body's members
24572,Coriolanus,31,1.1.85,MENENIUS,"Rebell'd against the belly, thus accused it:"
24573,Coriolanus,31,1.1.86,MENENIUS,That only like a gulf it did remain
24574,Coriolanus,31,1.1.87,MENENIUS,"I' the midst o' the body, idle and unactive,"
24575,Coriolanus,31,1.1.88,MENENIUS,"Still cupboarding the viand, never bearing"
24576,Coriolanus,31,1.1.89,MENENIUS,"Like labour with the rest, where the other instruments"
24577,Coriolanus,31,1.1.90,MENENIUS,"Did see and hear, devise, instruct, walk, feel,"
24578,Coriolanus,31,1.1.91,MENENIUS,"And, mutually participate, did minister"
24579,Coriolanus,31,1.1.92,MENENIUS,Unto the appetite and affection common
24580,Coriolanus,31,1.1.93,MENENIUS,Of the whole body. The belly answer'd--
24581,Coriolanus,32,1.1.94,First Citizen,"Well, sir, what answer made the belly?"
24582,Coriolanus,33,1.1.95,MENENIUS,"Sir, I shall tell you. With a kind of smile,"
24583,Coriolanus,33,1.1.96,MENENIUS,"Which ne'er came from the lungs, but even thus--"
24584,Coriolanus,33,1.1.97,MENENIUS,"For, look you, I may make the belly smile"
24585,Coriolanus,33,1.1.98,MENENIUS,As well as speak--it tauntingly replied
24586,Coriolanus,33,1.1.99,MENENIUS,"To the discontented members, the mutinous parts"
24587,Coriolanus,33,1.1.100,MENENIUS,"That envied his receipt, even so most fitly"
24588,Coriolanus,33,1.1.101,MENENIUS,As you malign our senators for that
24589,Coriolanus,33,1.1.102,MENENIUS,They are not such as you.
24590,Coriolanus,34,1.1.103,First Citizen,Your belly's answer? What!
24591,Coriolanus,34,1.1.104,First Citizen,"The kingly-crowned head, the vigilant eye,"
24592,Coriolanus,34,1.1.105,First Citizen,"The counsellor heart, the arm our soldier,"
24593,Coriolanus,34,1.1.106,First Citizen,"Our steed the leg, the tongue our trumpeter."
24594,Coriolanus,34,1.1.107,First Citizen,With other muniments and petty helps
24595,Coriolanus,34,1.1.108,First Citizen,"In this our fabric, if that they--"
24596,Coriolanus,35,1.1.109,MENENIUS,What then?
24597,Coriolanus,35,1.1.110,MENENIUS,"'Fore me, this fellow speaks! What then? what then?"
24598,Coriolanus,36,1.1.111,First Citizen,"Should by the cormorant belly be restrain'd,"
24599,Coriolanus,36,1.1.112,First Citizen,"Who is the sink o' the body,--"
24600,Coriolanus,37,1.1.113,MENENIUS,"Well, what then?"
24601,Coriolanus,38,1.1.114,First Citizen,"The former agents, if they did complain,"
24602,Coriolanus,38,1.1.115,First Citizen,What could the belly answer?
24603,Coriolanus,39,1.1.116,MENENIUS,I will tell you
24604,Coriolanus,39,1.1.117,MENENIUS,If you'll bestow a small--of what you have little--
24605,Coriolanus,39,1.1.118,MENENIUS,"Patience awhile, you'll hear the belly's answer."
24606,Coriolanus,40,1.1.119,First Citizen,Ye're long about it.
24607,Coriolanus,41,1.1.120,MENENIUS,"Note me this, good friend,"
24608,Coriolanus,41,1.1.121,MENENIUS,"Your most grave belly was deliberate,"
24609,Coriolanus,41,1.1.122,MENENIUS,"Not rash like his accusers, and thus answer'd:"
24610,Coriolanus,41,1.1.123,MENENIUS,"'True is it, my incorporate friends,' quoth he,"
24611,Coriolanus,41,1.1.124,MENENIUS,"'That I receive the general food at first,"
24612,Coriolanus,41,1.1.125,MENENIUS,"Which you do live upon, and fit it is,"
24613,Coriolanus,41,1.1.126,MENENIUS,Because I am the store-house and the shop
24614,Coriolanus,41,1.1.127,MENENIUS,"Of the whole body: but, if you do remember,"
24615,Coriolanus,41,1.1.128,MENENIUS,"I send it through the rivers of your blood,"
24616,Coriolanus,41,1.1.129,MENENIUS,"Even to the court, the heart, to the seat o' the brain,"
24617,Coriolanus,41,1.1.130,MENENIUS,"And, through the cranks and offices of man,"
24618,Coriolanus,41,1.1.131,MENENIUS,The strongest nerves and small inferior veins
24619,Coriolanus,41,1.1.132,MENENIUS,From me receive that natural competency
24620,Coriolanus,41,1.1.133,MENENIUS,"Whereby they live: and though that all at once,"
24621,Coriolanus,41,1.1.134,MENENIUS,"You, my good friends,'--this says the belly, mark me,--"
24622,Coriolanus,42,1.1.135,First Citizen,"Ay, sir, well, well."
24623,Coriolanus,43,1.1.136,MENENIUS,'Though all at once cannot

24627,Coriolanus,43,1.1.140,MENENIUS,And leave me but the bran.' What say you to't?
24628,Coriolanus,44,1.1.141,First Citizen,It was an answer: how apply you this?
24629,Coriolanus,45,1.1.142,MENENIUS,"The senators of Rome are this good belly,"
24630,Coriolanus,45,1.1.143,MENENIUS,"And you the mutinous members, for examine"
24631,Coriolanus,45,1.1.144,MENENIUS,"Their counsels and their cares, digest things rightly"

24633,Coriolanus,45,1.1.146,MENENIUS,No public benefit which you receive
24634,Coriolanus,45,1.1.147,MENENIUS,But it proceeds or comes from them to you
24635,Coriolanus,45,1.1.148,MENENIUS,"And no way from yourselves. What do you think,"
24636,Coriolanus,45,1.1.149,MENENIUS,"You, the great toe of this assembly?"
24637,Coriolanus,46,1.1.150,First Citizen,I the great toe! why the great toe?
24638,Coriolanus,47,1.1.151,MENENIUS,"For that, being one o' the lowest, basest, poorest,"
24639,Coriolanus,47,1.1.152,MENENIUS,"Of this most wise rebellion, thou go'st foremost:"
24640,Coriolanus,47,1.1.153,MENENIUS,"Thou rascal, that art worst in blood to run,"
24641,Coriolanus,47,1.1.154,MENENIUS,Lead'st first to win some vantage.
24642,Coriolanus,47,1.1.155,MENENIUS,But make you ready your stiff bats and clubs:
24643,Coriolanus,47,1.1.156,MENENIUS,"Rome and her rats are at the point of battle,"
24644,Coriolanus,47,1.1.157,MENENIUS,The one side must have bale.

24648,Coriolanus,48,1.1.160,MARCIUS,"That, rubbing the poor itch of your opinion,"
24649,Coriolanus,48,1.1.161,MARCIUS,Make yourselves scabs?
24650,Coriolanus,49,1.1.162,First Citizen,We have ever your good word.
24651,Coriolanus,50,1.1.163,MARCIUS,He that will give good words to thee will flatter

24653,Coriolanus,50,1.1.165,MARCIUS,"That like nor peace nor war? the one affrights you,"
24654,Coriolanus,50,1.1.166,MARCIUS,"The other makes you proud. He that trusts to you,"
24655,Coriolanus,50,1.1.167,MARCIUS,"Where he should find you lions, finds you hares,"

24657,Coriolanus,50,1.1.169,MARCIUS,"Than is the coal of fire upon the ice,"
24658,Coriolanus,50,1.1.170,MARCIUS,Or hailstone in the sun. Your virtue is

24665,Coriolanus,50,1.1.177,MARCIUS,Upon your favours swims with fins of lead
24666,Coriolanus,50,1.1.178,MARCIUS,And hews down oaks with rushes. Hang ye! Trust Ye?
24667,Coriolanus,50,1.1.179,MARCIUS,"With every minute you do change a mind,"
24668,Coriolanus,50,1.1.180,MARCIUS,"And call him noble that was now your hate,"
24669,Coriolanus,50,1.1.181,MARCIUS,"Him vile that was your garland. What's the matter,"
24670,Coriolanus,50,1.1.182,MARCIUS,That in these several places of the city
24671,Coriolanus,50,1.1.183,MARCIUS,"You cry against the noble senate, who,"
24672,Coriolanus,50,1.1.184,MARCIUS,"Under the gods, keep you in awe, which else"
24673,Coriolanus,50,1.1.185,MARCIUS,Would feed on one another? What's their seeking?
24674,Coriolanus,51,1.1.186,MENENIUS,"For corn at their own rates, whereof, they say,"
24675,Coriolanus,51,1.1.187,MENENIUS,The city is well stored.
24676,Coriolanus,52,1.1.188,MARCIUS,Hang 'em! They say!
24677,Coriolanus,52,1.1.189,MARCIUS,"They'll sit by the fire, and presume to know"
24678,Coriolanus,52,1.1.190,MARCIUS,"What's done i' the Capitol, who's like to rise,"
24679,Coriolanus,52,1.1.191,MARCIUS,"Who thrives and who declines, side factions"
24680,Coriolanus,52,1.1.192,MARCIUS,and give out
24681,Coriolanus,52,1.1.193,MARCIUS,"Conjectural marriages, making parties strong"
24682,Coriolanus,52,1.1.194,MARCIUS,And feebling such as stand not in their liking
24683,Coriolanus,52,1.1.195,MARCIUS,Below their cobbled shoes. They say there's
24684,Coriolanus,52,1.1.196,MARCIUS,grain enough!
24685,Coriolanus,52,1.1.197,MARCIUS,"Would the nobility lay aside their ruth,"
24686,Coriolanus,52,1.1.198,MARCIUS,"And let me use my sword, I'll make a quarry"
24687,Coriolanus,52,1.1.199,MARCIUS,"With thousands of these quarter'd slaves, as high"
24688,Coriolanus,52,1.1.200,MARCIUS,As I could pick my lance.
24689,Coriolanus,53,1.1.201,MENENIUS,"Nay, these are almost thoroughly persuaded,"
24690,Coriolanus,53,1.1.202,MENENIUS,"For though abundantly they lack discretion,"
24691,Coriolanus,53,1.1.203,MENENIUS,"Yet are they passing cowardly. But, I beseech you,"
24692,Coriolanus,53,1.1.204,MENENIUS,What says the other troop?
24693,Coriolanus,54,1.1.205,MARCIUS,They are dissolved: hang 'em!
24694,Coriolanus,54,1.1.206,MARCIUS,"They said they were an-hungry, sigh'd forth proverbs,"
24695,Coriolanus,54,1.1.207,MARCIUS,"That hunger broke stone walls, that dogs must eat,"
24696,Coriolanus,54,1.1.208,MARCIUS,"That meat was made for mouths, that the gods sent not"
24697,Coriolanus,54,1.1.209,MARCIUS,Corn for the rich men only: with these shreds
24698,Coriolanus,54,1.1.210,MARCIUS,"They vented their complainings, which being answer'd,"
24699,Coriolanus,54,1.1.211,MARCIUS,"And a petition granted them, a strange one--"
24700,Coriolanus,54,1.1.212,MARCIUS,"To break the heart of generosity,"
24701,Coriolanus,54,1.1.213,MARCIUS,And make bold power look pale--they threw their caps
24702,Coriolanus,54,1.1.214,MARCIUS,"As they would hang them on the horns o' the moon,"
24703,Coriolanus,54,1.1.215,MARCIUS,Shouting their emulation.
24704,Coriolanus,55,1.1.216,MENENIUS,What is granted them?
24705,Coriolanus,56,1.1.217,MARCIUS,"Five tribunes to defend their vulgar wisdoms,"
24706,Coriolanus,56,1.1.218,MARCIUS,"Of their own choice: one's Junius Brutus,"
24707,Coriolanus,56,1.1.219,MARCIUS,"Sicinius Velutus, and I know not--'Sdeath!"
24708,Coriolanus,56,1.1.220,MARCIUS,"The rabble should have first unroof'd the city,"
24709,Coriolanus,56,1.1.221,MARCIUS,Ere so prevail'd with me: it will in time
24710,Coriolanus,56,1.1.222,MARCIUS,Win upon power and throw forth greater themes
24711,Coriolanus,56,1.1.223,MARCIUS,For insurrection's arguing.
24712,Coriolanus,57,1.1.224,MENENIUS,This is strange.
24713,Coriolanus,58,1.1.225,MARCIUS,"Go, get you home, you fragments!"
24714,Coriolanus,58,,MARCIUS,"Enter a Messenger, hastily"
24715,Coriolanus,59,1.1.226,Messenger,Where's Caius Marcius?
24716,Coriolanus,60,1.1.227,MARCIUS,Here: what's the matter?
24717,Coriolanus,61,1.1.228,Messenger,"The news is, sir, the Volsces are in arms."
24718,Coriolanus,62,1.1.229,MARCIUS,I am glad on 't: then we shall ha' means to vent
24719,Coriolanus,62,1.1.230,MARCIUS,"Our musty superfluity. See, our best elders."
24720,Coriolanus,62,1.1.230,MARCIUS,"Enter COMINIUS, TITUS LARTIUS, and other Senators, JUNIUS BRUTUS and SICINIUS VELUTUS"

24722,Coriolanus,63,1.1.232,First Senator,The Volsces are in arms.
24723,Coriolanus,64,1.1.233,MARCIUS,"They have a leader,"

24726,Coriolanus,64,1.1.236,MARCIUS,"And were I any thing but what I am,"
24727,Coriolanus,64,1.1.237,MARCIUS,I would wish me only he.
24728,Coriolanus,65,1.1.238,COMINIUS,You have fought together.
24729,Coriolanus,66,1.1.239,MARCIUS,Were half to half the world by the ears and he.
24730,Coriolanus,66,1.1.240,MARCIUS,"Upon my party, I'ld revolt to make"
24731,Coriolanus,66,1.1.241,MARCIUS,Only my wars with him: he is a lion
24732,Coriolanus,66,1.1.242,MARCIUS,That I am proud to hunt.
24733,Coriolanus,67,1.1.243,First Senator,"Then, worthy Marcius,"
24734,Coriolanus,67,1.1.244,First Senator,Attend upon Cominius to these wars.
24735,Coriolanus,68,1.1.245,COMINIUS,It is your former promise.
24736,Coriolanus,69,1.1.246,MARCIUS,"Sir, it is,"
24737,Coriolanus,69,1.1.247,MARCIUS,"And I am constant. Titus Lartius, thou"

24753,Coriolanus,76,1.1.262,MARCIUS,"To gnaw their garners. Worshipful mutiners,"
24754,Coriolanus,76,1.1.263,MARCIUS,"Your valour puts well forth: pray, follow."
24755,Coriolanus,76,,MARCIUS,Citizens steal away. Exeunt all but SICINIUS and BRUTUS
24756,Coriolanus,77,1.1.264,SICINIUS,Was ever man so proud as is this Marcius?
24757,Coriolanus,78,1.1.265,BRUTUS,He has no equal.

24763,Coriolanus,84,1.1.271,BRUTUS,The present wars devour him: he is grown
24764,Coriolanus,84,1.1.272,BRUTUS,Too proud to be so valiant.

24769,Coriolanus,85,1.1.277,SICINIUS,Under Cominius.

24774,Coriolanus,86,1.1.282,BRUTUS,"Shall be the general's fault, though he perform"

24776,Coriolanus,86,1.1.284,BRUTUS,Will then cry out of Marcius 'O if he
24777,Coriolanus,86,1.1.285,BRUTUS,Had borne the business!'

24780,Coriolanus,87,1.1.288,SICINIUS,Of his demerits rob Cominius.
24781,Coriolanus,88,1.1.289,BRUTUS,Come:
24782,Coriolanus,88,1.1.290,BRUTUS,Half all Cominius' honours are to Marcius.
24783,Coriolanus,88,1.1.291,BRUTUS,"Though Marcius earned them not, and all his faults"

24794,Coriolanus,1,1.2.1,First Senator,"So, your opinion is, Aufidius,"
24795,Coriolanus,1,1.2.2,First Senator,That they of Rome are entered in our counsels
24796,Coriolanus,1,1.2.3,First Senator,And know how we proceed.
24797,Coriolanus,2,1.2.4,AUFIDIUS,Is it not yours?
24798,Coriolanus,2,1.2.5,AUFIDIUS,"What ever have been thought on in this state,"
24799,Coriolanus,2,1.2.6,AUFIDIUS,That could be brought to bodily act ere Rome
24800,Coriolanus,2,1.2.7,AUFIDIUS,Had circumvention? 'Tis not four days gone

24802,Coriolanus,2,1.2.9,AUFIDIUS,"I have the letter here, yes, here it is."
24803,Coriolanus,2,,AUFIDIUS,Reads

24807,Coriolanus,2,1.2.13,AUFIDIUS,"Cominius, Marcius your old enemy,"
24808,Coriolanus,2,1.2.14,AUFIDIUS,"Who is of Rome worse hated than of you,"

24810,Coriolanus,2,1.2.16,AUFIDIUS,These three lead on this preparation
24811,Coriolanus,2,1.2.17,AUFIDIUS,Whither 'tis bent: most likely 'tis for you:
24812,Coriolanus,2,1.2.18,AUFIDIUS,Consider of it.'
24813,Coriolanus,3,1.2.19,First Senator,Our army's in the field
24814,Coriolanus,3,1.2.20,First Senator,We never yet made doubt but Rome was ready
24815,Coriolanus,3,1.2.21,First Senator,To answer us.
24816,Coriolanus,4,1.2.22,AUFIDIUS,Nor did you think it folly
24817,Coriolanus,4,1.2.23,AUFIDIUS,To keep your great pretences veil'd till when
24818,Coriolanus,4,1.2.24,AUFIDIUS,"They needs must show themselves, which"

24821,Coriolanus,4,1.2.27,AUFIDIUS,"We shall be shorten'd in our aim, which was"
24822,Coriolanus,4,1.2.28,AUFIDIUS,To take in many towns ere almost Rome
24823,Coriolanus,4,1.2.29,AUFIDIUS,Should know we were afoot.

24831,Coriolanus,6,1.2.37,AUFIDIUS,"I speak from certainties. Nay, more,"
24832,Coriolanus,6,1.2.38,AUFIDIUS,"Some parcels of their power are forth already,"
24833,Coriolanus,6,1.2.39,AUFIDIUS,And only hitherward. I leave your honours.

24835,Coriolanus,6,1.2.41,AUFIDIUS,'Tis sworn between us we shall ever strike

25100,Coriolanus,1,1.6.11,COMINIUS,May give you thankful sacrifice.
25101,Coriolanus,1,,COMINIUS,Enter a Messenger
25102,Coriolanus,1,1.6.12,COMINIUS,Thy news?
25103,Coriolanus,2,1.6.13,Messenger,"The citizens of Corioli have issued,"
25104,Coriolanus,2,1.6.14,Messenger,And given to Lartius and to Marcius battle:
25105,Coriolanus,2,1.6.15,Messenger,"I saw our party to their trenches driven,"
25106,Coriolanus,2,1.6.16,Messenger,And then I came away.
25107,Coriolanus,3,1.6.17,COMINIUS,"Though thou speak'st truth,"
25108,Coriolanus,3,1.6.18,COMINIUS,Methinks thou speak'st not well.
25109,Coriolanus,3,1.6.19,COMINIUS,How long is't since?
25110,Coriolanus,4,1.6.20,Messenger,"Above an hour, my lord."
25111,Coriolanus,5,1.6.21,COMINIUS,"'Tis not a mile, briefly we heard their drums:"
25112,Coriolanus,5,1.6.22,COMINIUS,"How couldst thou in a mile confound an hour,"
25113,Coriolanus,5,1.6.23,COMINIUS,And bring thy news so late?
25114,Coriolanus,6,1.6.24,Messenger,Spies of the Volsces
25115,Coriolanus,6,1.6.25,Messenger,"Held me in chase, that I was forced to wheel"
25116,Coriolanus,6,1.6.26,Messenger,"Three or four miles about, else had I, sir,"
25117,Coriolanus,6,1.6.27,Messenger,Half an hour since brought my report.
25118,Coriolanus,7,1.6.28,COMINIUS,"Who's yonder,"
25119,Coriolanus,7,1.6.29,COMINIUS,That does appear as he were flay'd? O gods
25120,Coriolanus,7,1.6.30,COMINIUS,"He has the stamp of Marcius, and I have"
25121,Coriolanus,7,1.6.31,COMINIUS,Before-time seen him thus.
25122,Coriolanus,8,1.6.32,MARCIUS,[Within]                 Come I too late?
25123,Coriolanus,9,1.6.33,COMINIUS,The shepherd knows not thunder from a tabour
25124,Coriolanus,9,1.6.34,COMINIUS,More than I know the sound of Marcius' tongue
25125,Coriolanus,9,1.6.35,COMINIUS,From every meaner man.
25126,Coriolanus,9,,COMINIUS,Enter MARCIUS
25127,Coriolanus,10,1.6.36,MARCIUS,Come I too late?
25128,Coriolanus,11,1.6.37,COMINIUS,"Ay, if you come not in the blood of others,"
25129,Coriolanus,11,1.6.38,COMINIUS,But mantled in your own.
25130,Coriolanus,12,1.6.39,MARCIUS,"O, let me clip ye"
25131,Coriolanus,12,1.6.40,MARCIUS,"In arms as sound as when I woo'd, in heart"
25132,Coriolanus,12,1.6.41,MARCIUS,"As merry as when our nuptial day was done,"
25133,Coriolanus,12,1.6.42,MARCIUS,And tapers burn'd to bedward!
25134,Coriolanus,13,1.6.43,COMINIUS,"Flower of warriors,"
25135,Coriolanus,13,1.6.44,COMINIUS,How is it with Titus Lartius?
25136,Coriolanus,14,1.6.45,MARCIUS,As with a man busied about decrees:
25137,Coriolanus,14,1.6.46,MARCIUS,"Condemning some to death, and some to exile,"
25138,Coriolanus,14,1.6.47,MARCIUS,"Ransoming him, or pitying, threatening the other,"
25139,Coriolanus,14,1.6.48,MARCIUS,"Holding Corioli in the name of Rome,"
25140,Coriolanus,14,1.6.49,MARCIUS,"Even like a fawning greyhound in the leash,"
25141,Coriolanus,14,1.6.50,MARCIUS,To let him slip at will.
25142,Coriolanus,15,1.6.51,COMINIUS,Where is that slave
25143,Coriolanus,15,1.6.52,COMINIUS,Which told me they had beat you to your trenches?
25144,Coriolanus,15,1.6.53,COMINIUS,Where is he? call him hither.
25145,Coriolanus,16,1.6.54,MARCIUS,"Let him alone,"
25146,Coriolanus,16,1.6.55,MARCIUS,"He did inform the truth: but for our gentlemen,"
25147,Coriolanus,16,1.6.56,MARCIUS,The common file--a plague! tribunes for them!--
25148,Coriolanus,16,1.6.57,MARCIUS,The mouse ne'er shunn'd the cat as they did budge
25149,Coriolanus,16,1.6.58,MARCIUS,From rascals worse than they.
25150,Coriolanus,17,1.6.59,COMINIUS,But how prevail'd you?
25151,Coriolanus,18,1.6.60,MARCIUS,Will the time serve to tell? I do not think.
25152,Coriolanus,18,1.6.61,MARCIUS,Where is the enemy? are you lords o' the field?
25153,Coriolanus,18,1.6.62,MARCIUS,"If not, why cease you till you are so?"
25154,Coriolanus,19,1.6.63,COMINIUS,"Marcius,"
25155,Coriolanus,19,1.6.64,COMINIUS,We have at disadvantage fought and did
25156,Coriolanus,19,1.6.65,COMINIUS,Retire to win our purpose.
25157,Coriolanus,20,1.6.66,MARCIUS,How lies their battle? know you on which side
25158,Coriolanus,20,1.6.67,MARCIUS,They have placed their men of trust?
25159,Coriolanus,21,1.6.68,COMINIUS,"As I guess, Marcius,"
25160,Coriolanus,21,1.6.69,COMINIUS,"Their bands i' the vaward are the Antiates,"
25161,Coriolanus,21,1.6.70,COMINIUS,"Of their best trust, o'er them Aufidius,"
25162,Coriolanus,21,1.6.71,COMINIUS,Their very heart of hope.
25163,Coriolanus,22,1.6.72,MARCIUS,"I do beseech you,"
25164,Coriolanus,22,1.6.73,MARCIUS,"By all the battles wherein we have fought,"
25165,Coriolanus,22,1.6.74,MARCIUS,"By the blood we have shed together, by the vows"
25166,Coriolanus,22,1.6.75,MARCIUS,"We have made to endure friends, that you directly"
25167,Coriolanus,22,1.6.76,MARCIUS,"Set me against Aufidius and his Antiates,"
25168,Coriolanus,22,1.6.77,MARCIUS,"And that you not delay the present, but,"
25169,Coriolanus,22,1.6.78,MARCIUS,"Filling the air with swords advanced and darts,"
25170,Coriolanus,22,1.6.79,MARCIUS,We prove this very hour.
25171,Coriolanus,23,1.6.80,COMINIUS,Though I could wish
25172,Coriolanus,23,1.6.81,COMINIUS,You were conducted to a gentle bath
25173,Coriolanus,23,1.6.82,COMINIUS,"And balms applied to, you, yet dare I never"
25174,Coriolanus,23,1.6.83,COMINIUS,Deny your asking: take your choice of those
25175,Coriolanus,23,1.6.84,COMINIUS,That best can aid your action.
25176,Coriolanus,24,1.6.85,MARCIUS,Those are they
25177,Coriolanus,24,1.6.86,MARCIUS,That most are willing. If any such be here--
25178,Coriolanus,24,1.6.87,MARCIUS,As it were sin to doubt--that love this painting
25179,Coriolanus,24,1.6.88,MARCIUS,"Wherein you see me smear'd, if any fear"
25180,Coriolanus,24,1.6.89,MARCIUS,"Lesser his person than an ill report,"
25181,Coriolanus,24,1.6.90,MARCIUS,If any think brave death outweighs bad life
25182,Coriolanus,24,1.6.91,MARCIUS,"And that his country's dearer than himself,"
25183,Coriolanus,24,1.6.92,MARCIUS,"Let him alone, or so many so minded,"
25184,Coriolanus,24,1.6.93,MARCIUS,"Wave thus, to express his disposition,"
25185,Coriolanus,24,1.6.94,MARCIUS,And follow Marcius.
25186,Coriolanus,24,,MARCIUS,"They all shout and wave their swords, take him up in their arms, and cast up their caps"
25187,Coriolanus,24,1.6.95,MARCIUS,"O, me alone! make you a sword of me?"
25188,Coriolanus,24,1.6.96,MARCIUS,"If these shows be not outward, which of you"
25189,Coriolanus,24,1.6.97,MARCIUS,But is four Volsces? none of you but is
25190,Coriolanus,24,1.6.98,MARCIUS,Able to bear against the great Aufidius
25191,Coriolanus,24,1.6.99,MARCIUS,"A shield as hard as his. A certain number,"
25192,Coriolanus,24,1.6.100,MARCIUS,"Though thanks to all, must I select"
25193,Coriolanus,24,1.6.101,MARCIUS,from all: the rest
25194,Coriolanus,24,1.6.102,MARCIUS,"Shall bear the business in some other fight,"
25195,Coriolanus,24,1.6.103,MARCIUS,"As cause will be obey'd. Please you to march,"
25196,Coriolanus,24,1.6.104,MARCIUS,"And four shall quickly draw out my command,"
25197,Coriolanus,24,1.6.105,MARCIUS,Which men are best inclined.
25198,Coriolanus,25,1.6.106,COMINIUS,"March on, my fellows:"
25199,Coriolanus,25,1.6.107,COMINIUS,"Make good this ostentation, and you shall"
25200,Coriolanus,25,1.6.108,COMINIUS,Divide in all with us.
25201,Coriolanus,25,,COMINIUS,Exeunt
25202,Coriolanus,25,,COMINIUS,SCENE VII. The gates of Corioli.
25203,Coriolanus,25,,COMINIUS,"TITUS LARTIUS, having set a guard upon  Corioli, going with drum and trumpet toward  COMINIUS and CAIUS MARCIUS, enters with Lieutenant, other Soldiers, and a Scout"
25204,Coriolanus,1,1.7.1,LARTIUS,"So, let the ports be guarded: keep your duties,"
25205,Coriolanus,1,1.7.2,LARTIUS,"As I have set them down. If I do send, dispatch"
25206,Coriolanus,1,1.7.3,LARTIUS,Those centuries to our aid: the rest will serve
25207,Coriolanus,1,1.7.4,LARTIUS,"For a short holding: if we lose the field,"
25208,Coriolanus,1,1.7.5,LARTIUS,We cannot keep the town.
25209,Coriolanus,2,1.7.6,Lieutenant,"Fear not our care, sir."
25210,Coriolanus,3,1.7.7,LARTIUS,"Hence, and shut your gates upon's."
25211,Coriolanus,3,1.7.8,LARTIUS,"Our guider, come, to the Roman camp conduct us."
25212,Coriolanus,3,,LARTIUS,Exeunt
25213,Coriolanus,3,,LARTIUS,SCENE VIII. A field of battle.
25214,Coriolanus,3,,LARTIUS,"Alarum as in battle. Enter, from opposite sides, MARCIUS and AUFIDIUS"
25215,Coriolanus,1,1.8.1,MARCIUS,"I'll fight with none but thee, for I do hate thee"
25216,Coriolanus,1,1.8.2,MARCIUS,Worse than a promise-breaker.
25217,Coriolanus,2,1.8.3,AUFIDIUS,We hate alike:
25218,Coriolanus,2,1.8.4,AUFIDIUS,Not Afric owns a serpent I abhor
25219,Coriolanus,2,1.8.5,AUFIDIUS,More than thy fame and envy. Fix thy foot.
25220,Coriolanus,3,1.8.6,MARCIUS,"Let the first budger die the other's slave,"
25221,Coriolanus,3,1.8.7,MARCIUS,And the gods doom him after!
25222,Coriolanus,4,1.8.8,AUFIDIUS,"If I fly, Marcius,"
25223,Coriolanus,4,1.8.9,AUFIDIUS,Holloa me like a hare.
25224,Coriolanus,5,1.8.10,MARCIUS,"Within these three hours, Tullus,"
25225,Coriolanus,5,1.8.11,MARCIUS,"Alone I fought in your Corioli walls,"
25226,Coriolanus,5,1.8.12,MARCIUS,And made what work I pleased: 'tis not my blood
25227,Coriolanus,5,1.8.13,MARCIUS,"Wherein thou seest me mask'd, for thy revenge"
25228,Coriolanus,5,1.8.14,MARCIUS,Wrench up thy power to the highest.
25229,Coriolanus,6,1.8.15,AUFIDIUS,Wert thou the Hector
25230,Coriolanus,6,1.8.16,AUFIDIUS,"That was the whip of your bragg'd progeny,"
25231,Coriolanus,6,1.8.17,AUFIDIUS,Thou shouldst not scape me here.
25232,Coriolanus,6,,AUFIDIUS,"They fight, and certain Volsces come to the aid of  AUFIDIUS. MARCIUS fights till they be driven in breathless"
25233,Coriolanus,6,1.8.18,AUFIDIUS,"Officious, and not valiant, you have shamed me"
25234,Coriolanus,6,1.8.19,AUFIDIUS,In your condemned seconds.
25235,Coriolanus,6,,AUFIDIUS,Exeunt
25236,Coriolanus,6,,AUFIDIUS,SCENE IX. The Roman camp.
25237,Coriolanus,6,,AUFIDIUS,"Flourish. Alarum. A retreat is sounded. Flourish.  Enter, from one side, COMINIUS with the Romans, from the other side, MARCIUS, with his arm in a scarf"
25238,Coriolanus,1,1.9.1,COMINIUS,"If I should tell thee o'er this thy day's work,"
25239,Coriolanus,1,1.9.2,COMINIUS,Thou'ldst not believe thy deeds: but I'll report it
25240,Coriolanus,1,1.9.3,COMINIUS,"Where senators shall mingle tears with smiles,"
25241,Coriolanus,1,1.9.4,COMINIUS,"Where great patricians shall attend and shrug,"
25242,Coriolanus,1,1.9.5,COMINIUS,"I' the end admire, where ladies shall be frighted,"
25243,Coriolanus,1,1.9.6,COMINIUS,"And, gladly quaked, hear more, where the"
25244,Coriolanus,1,1.9.7,COMINIUS,"dull tribunes,"
25245,Coriolanus,1,1.9.8,COMINIUS,"That, with the fusty plebeians, hate thine honours,"
25246,Coriolanus,1,1.9.9,COMINIUS,Shall say against their hearts 'We thank the gods
25247,Coriolanus,1,1.9.10,COMINIUS,Our Rome hath such a soldier.'
25248,Coriolanus,1,1.9.11,COMINIUS,"Yet camest thou to a morsel of this feast,"
25249,Coriolanus,1,1.9.12,COMINIUS,Having fully dined before.
25250,Coriolanus,1,,COMINIUS,"Enter TITUS LARTIUS, with his power, from the pursuit"
25251,Coriolanus,2,1.9.13,LARTIUS,"O general,"
25252,Coriolanus,2,1.9.14,LARTIUS,"Here is the steed, we the caparison:"
25253,Coriolanus,2,1.9.15,LARTIUS,Hadst thou beheld--
25254,Coriolanus,3,1.9.16,MARCIUS,"Pray now, no more: my mother,"
25255,Coriolanus,3,1.9.17,MARCIUS,"Who has a charter to extol her blood,"
25256,Coriolanus,3,1.9.18,MARCIUS,When she does praise me grieves me. I have done
25257,Coriolanus,3,1.9.19,MARCIUS,"As you have done, that's what I can, induced"
25258,Coriolanus,3,1.9.20,MARCIUS,"As you have been, that's for my country:"
25259,Coriolanus,3,1.9.21,MARCIUS,He that has but effected his good will
25260,Coriolanus,3,1.9.22,MARCIUS,Hath overta'en mine act.
25261,Coriolanus,4,1.9.23,COMINIUS,You shall not be
25262,Coriolanus,4,1.9.24,COMINIUS,"The grave of your deserving, Rome must know"
25263,Coriolanus,4,1.9.25,COMINIUS,The value of her own: 'twere a concealment
25264,Coriolanus,4,1.9.26,COMINIUS,"Worse than a theft, no less than a traducement,"
25265,Coriolanus,4,1.9.27,COMINIUS,"To hide your doings, and to silence that,"
25266,Coriolanus,4,1.9.28,COMINIUS,"Which, to the spire and top of praises vouch'd,"
25267,Coriolanus,4,1.9.29,COMINIUS,"Would seem but modest: therefore, I beseech you"
25268,Coriolanus,4,1.9.30,COMINIUS,"In sign of what you are, not to reward"
25269,Coriolanus,4,1.9.31,COMINIUS,What you have done--before our army hear me.
25270,Coriolanus,5,1.9.32,MARCIUS,"I have some wounds upon me, and they smart"
25271,Coriolanus,5,1.9.33,MARCIUS,To hear themselves remember'd.
25272,Coriolanus,6,1.9.34,COMINIUS,"Should they not,"
25273,Coriolanus,6,1.9.35,COMINIUS,"Well might they fester 'gainst ingratitude,"
25274,Coriolanus,6,1.9.36,COMINIUS,"And tent themselves with death. Of all the horses,"
25275,Coriolanus,6,1.9.37,COMINIUS,"Whereof we have ta'en good and good store, of all"
25276,Coriolanus,6,1.9.38,COMINIUS,"The treasure in this field achieved and city,"
25277,Coriolanus,6,1.9.39,COMINIUS,"We render you the tenth, to be ta'en forth,"
25278,Coriolanus,6,1.9.40,COMINIUS,"Before the common distribution, at"
25279,Coriolanus,6,1.9.41,COMINIUS,Your only choice.
25280,Coriolanus,7,1.9.42,MARCIUS,"I thank you, general,"
25281,Coriolanus,7,1.9.43,MARCIUS,But cannot make my heart consent to take
25282,Coriolanus,7,1.9.44,MARCIUS,"A bribe to pay my sword: I do refuse it,"
25283,Coriolanus,7,1.9.45,MARCIUS,And stand upon my common part with those
25284,Coriolanus,7,1.9.46,MARCIUS,That have beheld the doing.
25285,Coriolanus,7,1.9.46,MARCIUS,A long flourish. They all cry 'Marcius! Marcius!'  cast up their caps and lances: COMINIUS and LARTIUS stand bare
25286,Coriolanus,8,1.9.47,MARCIUS,"May these same instruments, which you profane,"
25287,Coriolanus,8,1.9.48,MARCIUS,Never sound more! when drums and trumpets shall
25288,Coriolanus,8,1.9.49,MARCIUS,"I' the field prove flatterers, let courts and cities be"
25289,Coriolanus,8,1.9.50,MARCIUS,Made all of false-faced soothing!
25290,Coriolanus,8,1.9.51,MARCIUS,"When steel grows soft as the parasite's silk,"
25291,Coriolanus,8,1.9.52,MARCIUS,Let him be made a coverture for the wars!
25292,Coriolanus,8,1.9.53,MARCIUS,"No more, I say! For that I have not wash'd"
25293,Coriolanus,8,1.9.54,MARCIUS,"My nose that bled, or foil'd some debile wretch.--"
25294,Coriolanus,8,1.9.55,MARCIUS,"Which, without note, here's many else have done,--"
25295,Coriolanus,8,1.9.56,MARCIUS,You shout me forth
25296,Coriolanus,8,1.9.57,MARCIUS,"In acclamations hyperbolical,"
25297,Coriolanus,8,1.9.58,MARCIUS,As if I loved my little should be dieted
25298,Coriolanus,8,1.9.59,MARCIUS,In praises sauced with lies.
25299,Coriolanus,9,1.9.60,COMINIUS,"Too modest are you,"
25300,Coriolanus,9,1.9.61,COMINIUS,More cruel to your good report than grateful
25301,Coriolanus,9,1.9.62,COMINIUS,"To us that give you truly: by your patience,"
25302,Coriolanus,9,1.9.63,COMINIUS,"If 'gainst yourself you be incensed, we'll put you,"
25303,Coriolanus,9,1.9.64,COMINIUS,"Like one that means his proper harm, in manacles,"
25304,Coriolanus,9,1.9.65,COMINIUS,"Then reason safely with you. Therefore, be it known,"
25305,Coriolanus,9,1.9.66,COMINIUS,"As to us, to all the world, that Caius Marcius"
25306,Coriolanus,9,1.9.67,COMINIUS,"Wears this war's garland: in token of the which,"
25307,Coriolanus,9,1.9.68,COMINIUS,"My noble steed, known to the camp, I give him,"
25308,Coriolanus,9,1.9.69,COMINIUS,"With all his trim belonging, and from this time,"
25309,Coriolanus,9,1.9.70,COMINIUS,"For what he did before Corioli, call him,"
25310,Coriolanus,9,1.9.71,COMINIUS,"With all the applause and clamour of the host,"
25311,Coriolanus,9,1.9.72,COMINIUS,CAIUS MARCIUS CORIOLANUS! Bear
25312,Coriolanus,9,1.9.73,COMINIUS,The addition nobly ever!
25313,Coriolanus,9,,COMINIUS,"Flourish. Trumpets sound, and drums"
25314,Coriolanus,10,1.9.74,All,Caius Marcius Coriolanus!
25315,Coriolanus,11,1.9.75,CORIOLANUS,"I will go wash,"

25336,Coriolanus,16,1.9.96,CORIOLANUS,And wrath o'erwhelm'd my pity: I request you
25337,Coriolanus,16,1.9.97,CORIOLANUS,To give my poor host freedom.
25338,Coriolanus,17,1.9.98,COMINIUS,"O, well begg'd!"

25356,Coriolanus,3,1.10.6,AUFIDIUS,What good condition can a treaty find
25357,Coriolanus,3,1.10.7,AUFIDIUS,"I' the part that is at mercy? Five times, Marcius,"
25358,Coriolanus,3,1.10.8,AUFIDIUS,"I have fought with thee: so often hast thou beat me,"
25359,Coriolanus,3,1.10.9,AUFIDIUS,"And wouldst do so, I think, should we encounter"
25360,Coriolanus,3,1.10.10,AUFIDIUS,"As often as we eat. By the elements,"

25368,Coriolanus,5,1.10.18,AUFIDIUS,"Bolder, though not so subtle. My valour's poison'd"

25370,Coriolanus,5,1.10.20,AUFIDIUS,"Shall fly out of itself: nor sleep nor sanctuary,"

25381,Coriolanus,6,1.10.31,First Soldier,Will not you go?
25382,Coriolanus,7,1.10.32,AUFIDIUS,I am attended at the cypress grove: I pray you--

25390,Coriolanus,8,,First Soldier,"Enter MENENIUS with the two Tribunes of the people, SICINIUS and BRUTUS."
25391,Coriolanus,1,2.1.1,MENENIUS,The augurer tells me we shall have news to-night.
25392,Coriolanus,2,2.1.2,BRUTUS,Good or bad?
25393,Coriolanus,3,2.1.3,MENENIUS,"Not according to the prayer of the people, for they"
25394,Coriolanus,3,2.1.4,MENENIUS,love not Marcius.
25395,Coriolanus,4,2.1.5,SICINIUS,Nature teaches beasts to know their friends.
25396,Coriolanus,5,2.1.6,MENENIUS,"Pray you, who does the wolf love?"
25397,Coriolanus,6,2.1.7,SICINIUS,The lamb.
25398,Coriolanus,7,2.1.8,MENENIUS,"Ay, to devour him, as the hungry plebeians would the"
25399,Coriolanus,7,2.1.9,MENENIUS,noble Marcius.
25400,Coriolanus,8,2.1.10,BRUTUS,"He's a lamb indeed, that baes like a bear."
25401,Coriolanus,9,2.1.11,MENENIUS,"He's a bear indeed, that lives like a lamb. You two"
25402,Coriolanus,9,2.1.12,MENENIUS,are old men: tell me one thing that I shall ask you.
25403,Coriolanus,10,2.1.13,Both,"Well, sir."
25404,Coriolanus,11,2.1.14,MENENIUS,"In what enormity is Marcius poor in, that you two"
25405,Coriolanus,11,2.1.15,MENENIUS,have not in abundance?
25406,Coriolanus,12,2.1.16,BRUTUS,"He's poor in no one fault, but stored with all."
25407,Coriolanus,13,2.1.17,SICINIUS,Especially in pride.
25408,Coriolanus,14,2.1.18,BRUTUS,And topping all others in boasting.
25409,Coriolanus,15,2.1.19,MENENIUS,This is strange now: do you two know how you are
25410,Coriolanus,15,2.1.20,MENENIUS,"censured here in the city, I mean of us o' the"
25411,Coriolanus,15,2.1.21,MENENIUS,right-hand file? do you?
25412,Coriolanus,16,2.1.22,Both,"Why, how are we censured?"
25413,Coriolanus,17,2.1.23,MENENIUS,"Because you talk of pride now,--will you not be angry?"
25414,Coriolanus,18,2.1.24,Both,"Well, well, sir, well."
25415,Coriolanus,19,2.1.25,MENENIUS,"Why, 'tis no great matter, for a very little thief of"
25416,Coriolanus,19,2.1.26,MENENIUS,occasion will rob you of a great deal of patience:
25417,Coriolanus,19,2.1.27,MENENIUS,"give your dispositions the reins, and be angry at"
25418,Coriolanus,19,2.1.28,MENENIUS,"your pleasures, at the least if you take it as a"
25419,Coriolanus,19,2.1.29,MENENIUS,pleasure to you in being so. You blame Marcius for
25420,Coriolanus,19,2.1.30,MENENIUS,being proud?
25421,Coriolanus,20,2.1.31,BRUTUS,"We do it not alone, sir."
25422,Coriolanus,21,2.1.32,MENENIUS,"I know you can do very little alone, for your helps"
25423,Coriolanus,21,2.1.33,MENENIUS,"are many, or else your actions would grow wondrous"
25424,Coriolanus,21,2.1.34,MENENIUS,single: your abilities are too infant-like for
25425,Coriolanus,21,2.1.35,MENENIUS,doing much alone. You talk of pride: O that you
25426,Coriolanus,21,2.1.36,MENENIUS,"could turn your eyes toward the napes of your necks,"
25427,Coriolanus,21,2.1.37,MENENIUS,and make but an interior survey of your good selves!
25428,Coriolanus,21,2.1.38,MENENIUS,O that you could!
25429,Coriolanus,22,2.1.39,BRUTUS,"What then, sir?"
25430,Coriolanus,23,2.1.40,MENENIUS,"Why, then you should discover a brace of unmeriting,"
25431,Coriolanus,23,2.1.41,MENENIUS,"proud, violent, testy magistrates, alias fools, as"
25432,Coriolanus,23,2.1.42,MENENIUS,any in Rome.
25433,Coriolanus,24,2.1.43,SICINIUS,"Menenius, you are known well enough too."
25434,Coriolanus,25,2.1.44,MENENIUS,"I am known to be a humorous patrician, and one that"
25435,Coriolanus,25,2.1.45,MENENIUS,loves a cup of hot wine with not a drop of allaying
25436,Coriolanus,25,2.1.46,MENENIUS,"Tiber in't, said to be something imperfect in"
25437,Coriolanus,25,2.1.47,MENENIUS,"favouring the first complaint, hasty and tinder-like"
25438,Coriolanus,25,2.1.48,MENENIUS,"upon too trivial motion, one that converses more"
25439,Coriolanus,25,2.1.49,MENENIUS,with the buttock of the night than with the forehead
25440,Coriolanus,25,2.1.50,MENENIUS,"of the morning: what I think I utter, and spend my"
25441,Coriolanus,25,2.1.51,MENENIUS,malice in my breath. Meeting two such wealsmen as
25442,Coriolanus,25,2.1.52,MENENIUS,you are--I cannot call you Lycurguses--if the drink
25443,Coriolanus,25,2.1.53,MENENIUS,"you give me touch my palate adversely, I make a"
25444,Coriolanus,25,2.1.54,MENENIUS,crooked face at it. I can't say your worships have
25445,Coriolanus,25,2.1.55,MENENIUS,"delivered the matter well, when I find the ass in"
25446,Coriolanus,25,2.1.56,MENENIUS,compound with the major part of your syllables: and
25447,Coriolanus,25,2.1.57,MENENIUS,though I must be content to bear with those that say
25448,Coriolanus,25,2.1.58,MENENIUS,"you are reverend grave men, yet they lie deadly that"
25449,Coriolanus,25,2.1.59,MENENIUS,tell you you have good faces. If you see this in
25450,Coriolanus,25,2.1.60,MENENIUS,"the map of my microcosm, follows it that I am known"
25451,Coriolanus,25,2.1.61,MENENIUS,well enough too? what barm can your bisson
25452,Coriolanus,25,2.1.62,MENENIUS,"conspectuities glean out of this character, if I be"
25453,Coriolanus,25,2.1.63,MENENIUS,known well enough too?
25454,Coriolanus,26,2.1.64,BRUTUS,"Come, sir, come, we know you well enough."
25455,Coriolanus,27,2.1.65,MENENIUS,"You know neither me, yourselves nor any thing. You"
25456,Coriolanus,27,2.1.66,MENENIUS,are ambitious for poor knaves' caps and legs: you
25457,Coriolanus,27,2.1.67,MENENIUS,wear out a good wholesome forenoon in hearing a
25458,Coriolanus,27,2.1.68,MENENIUS,"cause between an orange wife and a fosset-seller,"
25459,Coriolanus,27,2.1.69,MENENIUS,and then rejourn the controversy of three pence to a
25460,Coriolanus,27,2.1.70,MENENIUS,second day of audience. When you are hearing a
25461,Coriolanus,27,2.1.71,MENENIUS,"matter between party and party, if you chance to be"
25462,Coriolanus,27,2.1.72,MENENIUS,"pinched with the colic, you make faces like"
25463,Coriolanus,27,2.1.73,MENENIUS,"mummers, set up the bloody flag against all"
25464,Coriolanus,27,2.1.74,MENENIUS,"patience, and, in roaring for a chamber-pot,"
25465,Coriolanus,27,2.1.75,MENENIUS,dismiss the controversy bleeding the more entangled
25466,Coriolanus,27,2.1.76,MENENIUS,by your hearing: all the peace you make in their
25467,Coriolanus,27,2.1.77,MENENIUS,"cause is, calling both the parties knaves. You are"
25468,Coriolanus,27,2.1.78,MENENIUS,a pair of strange ones.
25469,Coriolanus,28,2.1.79,BRUTUS,"Come, come, you are well understood to be a"
25470,Coriolanus,28,2.1.80,BRUTUS,perfecter giber for the table than a necessary
25471,Coriolanus,28,2.1.81,BRUTUS,bencher in the Capitol.
25472,Coriolanus,29,2.1.82,MENENIUS,"Our very priests must become mockers, if they shall"
25473,Coriolanus,29,2.1.83,MENENIUS,encounter such ridiculous subjects as you are. When
25474,Coriolanus,29,2.1.84,MENENIUS,"you speak best unto the purpose, it is not worth the"
25475,Coriolanus,29,2.1.85,MENENIUS,"wagging of your beards, and your beards deserve not"
25476,Coriolanus,29,2.1.86,MENENIUS,so honourable a grave as to stuff a botcher's
25477,Coriolanus,29,2.1.87,MENENIUS,"cushion, or to be entombed in an ass's pack-"
25478,Coriolanus,29,2.1.88,MENENIUS,"saddle. Yet you must be saying, Marcius is proud,"
25479,Coriolanus,29,2.1.89,MENENIUS,"who in a cheap estimation, is worth predecessors"
25480,Coriolanus,29,2.1.90,MENENIUS,"since Deucalion, though peradventure some of the"
25481,Coriolanus,29,2.1.91,MENENIUS,best of 'em were hereditary hangmen. God-den to
25482,Coriolanus,29,2.1.92,MENENIUS,your worships: more of your conversation would
25483,Coriolanus,29,2.1.93,MENENIUS,"infect my brain, being the herdsmen of the beastly"
25484,Coriolanus,29,2.1.94,MENENIUS,plebeians: I will be bold to take my leave of you.
25485,Coriolanus,29,,MENENIUS,BRUTUS and SICINIUS go aside
25486,Coriolanus,29,,MENENIUS,"Enter VOLUMNIA, VIRGILIA, and VALERIA"
25487,Coriolanus,29,2.1.95,MENENIUS,"How now, my as fair as noble ladies,--and the moon,"
25488,Coriolanus,29,2.1.96,MENENIUS,"were she earthly, no nobler,--whither do you follow"
25489,Coriolanus,29,2.1.97,MENENIUS,your eyes so fast?
25490,Coriolanus,30,2.1.98,VOLUMNIA,"Honourable Menenius, my boy Marcius approaches, for"
25491,Coriolanus,30,2.1.99,VOLUMNIA,"the love of Juno, let's go."
25492,Coriolanus,31,2.1.100,MENENIUS,Ha! Marcius coming home!
25493,Coriolanus,32,2.1.101,VOLUMNIA,"Ay, worthy Menenius, and with most prosperous"
25494,Coriolanus,32,2.1.102,VOLUMNIA,approbation.
25495,Coriolanus,33,2.1.103,MENENIUS,"Take my cap, Jupiter, and I thank thee. Hoo!"
25496,Coriolanus,33,2.1.104,MENENIUS,Marcius coming home!
25497,Coriolanus,35,2.1.105,VIRGILIA,"Nay,'tis true."
25498,Coriolanus,36,2.1.106,VOLUMNIA,"Look, here's a letter from him: the state hath"
25499,Coriolanus,36,2.1.107,VOLUMNIA,"another, his wife another, and, I think, there's one"
25500,Coriolanus,36,2.1.108,VOLUMNIA,at home for you.
25501,Coriolanus,37,2.1.109,MENENIUS,I will make my very house reel tonight: a letter for
25502,Coriolanus,37,2.1.110,MENENIUS,me!
25503,Coriolanus,38,2.1.111,VIRGILIA,"Yes, certain, there's a letter for you, I saw't."
25504,Coriolanus,39,2.1.112,MENENIUS,A letter for me! it gives me an estate of seven
25505,Coriolanus,39,2.1.113,MENENIUS,"years' health, in which time I will make a lip at"
25506,Coriolanus,39,2.1.114,MENENIUS,the physician: the most sovereign prescription in
25507,Coriolanus,39,2.1.115,MENENIUS,"Galen is but empiricutic, and, to this preservative,"
25508,Coriolanus,39,2.1.116,MENENIUS,of no better report than a horse-drench. Is he
25509,Coriolanus,39,2.1.117,MENENIUS,not wounded? he was wont to come home wounded.
25510,Coriolanus,40,2.1.118,VIRGILIA,"O, no, no, no."
25511,Coriolanus,41,2.1.119,VOLUMNIA,"O, he is wounded, I thank the gods for't."
25512,Coriolanus,42,2.1.120,MENENIUS,"So do I too, if it be not too much: brings a'"
25513,Coriolanus,42,2.1.121,MENENIUS,victory in his pocket? the wounds become him.
25514,Coriolanus,43,2.1.122,VOLUMNIA,"On's brows: Menenius, he comes the third time home"
25515,Coriolanus,43,2.1.123,VOLUMNIA,with the oaken garland.
25516,Coriolanus,44,2.1.124,MENENIUS,Has he disciplined Aufidius soundly?
25517,Coriolanus,45,2.1.125,VOLUMNIA,"Titus Lartius writes, they fought together, but"
25518,Coriolanus,45,2.1.126,VOLUMNIA,Aufidius got off.
25519,Coriolanus,46,2.1.127,MENENIUS,"And 'twas time for him too, I'll warrant him that:"
25520,Coriolanus,46,2.1.128,MENENIUS,"an he had stayed by him, I would not have been so"
25521,Coriolanus,46,2.1.129,MENENIUS,"fidiused for all the chests in Corioli, and the gold"
25522,Coriolanus,46,2.1.130,MENENIUS,that's in them. Is the senate possessed of this?
25523,Coriolanus,47,2.1.131,VOLUMNIA,"Good ladies, let's go. Yes, yes, yes, the senate"
25524,Coriolanus,47,2.1.132,VOLUMNIA,"has letters from the general, wherein he gives my"
25525,Coriolanus,47,2.1.133,VOLUMNIA,son the whole name of the war: he hath in this
25526,Coriolanus,47,2.1.134,VOLUMNIA,action outdone his former deeds doubly
25527,Coriolanus,48,2.1.135,VALERIA,"In troth, there's wondrous things spoke of him."
25528,Coriolanus,49,2.1.136,MENENIUS,"Wondrous! ay, I warrant you, and not without his"
25529,Coriolanus,49,2.1.137,MENENIUS,true purchasing.
25530,Coriolanus,50,2.1.138,VIRGILIA,The gods grant them true!
25531,Coriolanus,51,2.1.139,VOLUMNIA,"True! pow, wow."
25532,Coriolanus,52,2.1.140,MENENIUS,True! I'll be sworn they are true.
25533,Coriolanus,52,2.1.141,MENENIUS,Where is he wounded?
25534,Coriolanus,52,,MENENIUS,To the Tribunes
25535,Coriolanus,52,2.1.142,MENENIUS,God save your good worships! Marcius is coming
25536,Coriolanus,52,2.1.143,MENENIUS,home: he has more cause to be proud. Where is he wounded?
25537,Coriolanus,53,2.1.144,VOLUMNIA,I' the shoulder and i' the left arm there will be
25538,Coriolanus,53,2.1.145,VOLUMNIA,"large cicatrices to show the people, when he shall"
25539,Coriolanus,53,2.1.146,VOLUMNIA,stand for his place. He received in the repulse of
25540,Coriolanus,53,2.1.147,VOLUMNIA,Tarquin seven hurts i' the body.
25541,Coriolanus,54,2.1.148,MENENIUS,"One i' the neck, and two i' the thigh,--there's"
25542,Coriolanus,54,2.1.149,MENENIUS,nine that I know.
25543,Coriolanus,55,2.1.150,VOLUMNIA,"He had, before this last expedition, twenty-five"
25544,Coriolanus,55,2.1.151,VOLUMNIA,wounds upon him.
25545,Coriolanus,56,2.1.152,MENENIUS,Now it's twenty-seven: every gash was an enemy's grave.
25546,Coriolanus,56,,MENENIUS,A shout and flourish
25547,Coriolanus,56,2.1.153,MENENIUS,Hark! the trumpets.
25548,Coriolanus,57,2.1.154,VOLUMNIA,These are the ushers of Marcius: before him he
25549,Coriolanus,57,2.1.155,VOLUMNIA,"carries noise, and behind him he leaves tears:"
25550,Coriolanus,57,2.1.156,VOLUMNIA,"Death, that dark spirit, in 's nervy arm doth lie,"
25551,Coriolanus,57,2.1.157,VOLUMNIA,"Which, being advanced, declines, and then men die."
25552,Coriolanus,57,2.1.157,VOLUMNIA,"A sennet. Trumpets sound. Enter COMINIUS the  general, and TITUS LARTIUS, between them, CORIOLANUS,  crowned with an oaken garland, with Captains and Soldiers, and a Herald"

25621,Coriolanus,76,2.1.222,BRUTUS,To win a vulgar station: or veil'd dames
25622,Coriolanus,76,2.1.223,BRUTUS,Commit the war of white and damask in
25623,Coriolanus,76,2.1.224,BRUTUS,Their nicely-gawded cheeks to the wanton spoil
25624,Coriolanus,76,2.1.225,BRUTUS,Of Phoebus' burning kisses: such a pother
25625,Coriolanus,76,2.1.226,BRUTUS,As if that whatsoever god who leads him
25626,Coriolanus,76,2.1.227,BRUTUS,Were slily crept into his human powers
25627,Coriolanus,76,2.1.228,BRUTUS,And gave him graceful posture.

25629,Coriolanus,77,2.1.230,SICINIUS,I warrant him consul.
25630,Coriolanus,78,2.1.231,BRUTUS,"Then our office may,"
25631,Coriolanus,78,2.1.232,BRUTUS,"During his power, go sleep."
25632,Coriolanus,79,2.1.233,SICINIUS,He cannot temperately transport his honours
25633,Coriolanus,79,2.1.234,SICINIUS,"From where he should begin and end, but will"
25634,Coriolanus,79,2.1.235,SICINIUS,Lose those he hath won.
25635,Coriolanus,80,2.1.236,BRUTUS,In that there's comfort.
25636,Coriolanus,81,2.1.237,SICINIUS,Doubt not

25638,Coriolanus,81,2.1.239,SICINIUS,Upon their ancient malice will forget

25640,Coriolanus,81,2.1.241,SICINIUS,That he will give them make I as little question
25641,Coriolanus,81,2.1.242,SICINIUS,As he is proud to do't.
25642,Coriolanus,82,2.1.243,BRUTUS,"I heard him swear,"
25643,Coriolanus,82,2.1.244,BRUTUS,"Were he to stand for consul, never would he"
25644,Coriolanus,82,2.1.245,BRUTUS,Appear i' the market-place nor on him put

25648,Coriolanus,83,2.1.249,SICINIUS,'Tis right.

25650,Coriolanus,84,2.1.251,BRUTUS,"Than carry it but by the suit of the gentry to him,"
25651,Coriolanus,84,2.1.252,BRUTUS,And the desire of the nobles.
25652,Coriolanus,85,2.1.253,SICINIUS,I wish no better
25653,Coriolanus,85,2.1.254,SICINIUS,Than have him hold that purpose and to put it
25654,Coriolanus,85,2.1.255,SICINIUS,In execution.
25655,Coriolanus,86,2.1.256,BRUTUS,'Tis most like he will.

25657,Coriolanus,87,2.1.258,SICINIUS,A sure destruction.
25658,Coriolanus,88,2.1.259,BRUTUS,So it must fall out
25659,Coriolanus,88,2.1.260,BRUTUS,"To him or our authorities. For an end,"
25660,Coriolanus,88,2.1.261,BRUTUS,We must suggest the people in what hatred
25661,Coriolanus,88,2.1.262,BRUTUS,"He still hath held them, that to's power he would"
25662,Coriolanus,88,2.1.263,BRUTUS,"Have made them mules, silenced their pleaders and"
25663,Coriolanus,88,2.1.264,BRUTUS,"Dispropertied their freedoms, holding them,"
25664,Coriolanus,88,2.1.265,BRUTUS,"In human action and capacity,"
25665,Coriolanus,88,2.1.266,BRUTUS,Of no more soul nor fitness for the world
25666,Coriolanus,88,2.1.267,BRUTUS,"Than camels in the war, who have their provand"

25668,Coriolanus,88,2.1.269,BRUTUS,For sinking under them.
25669,Coriolanus,89,2.1.270,SICINIUS,"This, as you say, suggested"
25670,Coriolanus,89,2.1.271,SICINIUS,At some time when his soaring insolence
25671,Coriolanus,89,2.1.272,SICINIUS,"Shall touch the people--which time shall not want,"
25672,Coriolanus,89,2.1.273,SICINIUS,"If he be put upon 't, and that's as easy"
25673,Coriolanus,89,2.1.274,SICINIUS,As to set dogs on sheep--will be his fire
25674,Coriolanus,89,2.1.275,SICINIUS,"To kindle their dry stubble, and their blaze"
25675,Coriolanus,89,2.1.276,SICINIUS,Shall darken him for ever.
25676,Coriolanus,89,,SICINIUS,Enter a Messenger
25677,Coriolanus,90,2.1.277,BRUTUS,What's the matter?
25678,Coriolanus,91,2.1.278,Messenger,You are sent for to the Capitol. 'Tis thought
25679,Coriolanus,91,2.1.279,Messenger,That Marcius shall be consul:
25680,Coriolanus,91,2.1.280,Messenger,I have seen the dumb men throng to see him and
25681,Coriolanus,91,2.1.281,Messenger,"The blind to bear him speak: matrons flung gloves,"
25682,Coriolanus,91,2.1.282,Messenger,"Ladies and maids their scarfs and handkerchers,"
25683,Coriolanus,91,2.1.283,Messenger,"Upon him as he pass'd: the nobles bended,"
25684,Coriolanus,91,2.1.284,Messenger,"As to Jove's statue, and the commons made"
25685,Coriolanus,91,2.1.285,Messenger,A shower and thunder with their caps and shouts:
25686,Coriolanus,91,2.1.286,Messenger,I never saw the like.
25687,Coriolanus,92,2.1.287,BRUTUS,"Let's to the Capitol,"
25688,Coriolanus,92,2.1.288,BRUTUS,"And carry with us ears and eyes for the time,"
25689,Coriolanus,92,2.1.289,BRUTUS,But hearts for the event.
25690,Coriolanus,93,2.1.290,SICINIUS,Have with you.
25691,Coriolanus,93,,SICINIUS,Exeunt
25692,Coriolanus,93,,SICINIUS,SCENE II. The same. The Capitol.
25693,Coriolanus,93,,SICINIUS,"Enter two Officers, to lay cushions"
25694,Coriolanus,1,2.2.1,First Officer,"Come, come, they are almost here. How many stand"
25695,Coriolanus,1,2.2.2,First Officer,for consulships?
25696,Coriolanus,2,2.2.3,Second Officer,"Three, they say: but 'tis thought of every one"
25697,Coriolanus,2,2.2.4,Second Officer,Coriolanus will carry it.
25698,Coriolanus,3,2.2.5,First Officer,"That's a brave fellow, but he's vengeance proud, and"
25699,Coriolanus,3,2.2.6,First Officer,loves not the common people.
25700,Coriolanus,4,2.2.7,Second Officer,"Faith, there had been many great men that have"
25701,Coriolanus,4,2.2.8,Second Officer,"flattered the people, who ne'er loved them, and there"
25702,Coriolanus,4,2.2.9,Second Officer,"be many that they have loved, they know not"
25703,Coriolanus,4,2.2.10,Second Officer,"wherefore: so that, if they love they know not why,"
25704,Coriolanus,4,2.2.11,Second Officer,"they hate upon no better a ground: therefore, for"
25705,Coriolanus,4,2.2.12,Second Officer,Coriolanus neither to care whether they love or hate
25706,Coriolanus,4,2.2.13,Second Officer,him manifests the true knowledge he has in their
25707,Coriolanus,4,2.2.14,Second Officer,"disposition, and out of his noble carelessness lets"
25708,Coriolanus,4,2.2.15,Second Officer,them plainly see't.
25709,Coriolanus,5,2.2.16,First Officer,"If he did not care whether he had their love or no,"
25710,Coriolanus,5,2.2.17,First Officer,he waved indifferently 'twixt doing them neither
25711,Coriolanus,5,2.2.18,First Officer,good nor harm: but he seeks their hate with greater
25712,Coriolanus,5,2.2.19,First Officer,"devotion than can render it him, and leaves"
25713,Coriolanus,5,2.2.20,First Officer,nothing undone that may fully discover him their
25714,Coriolanus,5,2.2.21,First Officer,"opposite. Now, to seem to affect the malice and"
25715,Coriolanus,5,2.2.22,First Officer,displeasure of the people is as bad as that which he
25716,Coriolanus,5,2.2.23,First Officer,"dislikes, to flatter them for their love."
25717,Coriolanus,6,2.2.24,Second Officer,He hath deserved worthily of his country: and his
25718,Coriolanus,6,2.2.25,Second Officer,"ascent is not by such easy degrees as those who,"
25719,Coriolanus,6,2.2.26,Second Officer,"having been supple and courteous to the people,"
25720,Coriolanus,6,2.2.27,Second Officer,"bonneted, without any further deed to have them at"
25721,Coriolanus,6,2.2.28,Second Officer,an into their estimation and report: but he hath so
25722,Coriolanus,6,2.2.29,Second Officer,"planted his honours in their eyes, and his actions"
25723,Coriolanus,6,2.2.30,Second Officer,"in their hearts, that for their tongues to be"
25724,Coriolanus,6,2.2.31,Second Officer,"silent, and not confess so much, were a kind of"
25725,Coriolanus,6,2.2.32,Second Officer,"ingrateful injury, to report otherwise, were a"
25726,Coriolanus,6,2.2.33,Second Officer,"malice, that, giving itself the lie, would pluck"
25727,Coriolanus,6,2.2.34,Second Officer,reproof and rebuke from every ear that heard it.
25728,Coriolanus,7,2.2.35,First Officer,"No more of him, he is a worthy man: make way, they"
25729,Coriolanus,7,2.2.36,First Officer,are coming.
25730,Coriolanus,7,2.2.36,First Officer,"A sennet. Enter, with actors before them, COMINIUS  the consul, MENENIUS, CORIOLANUS, Senators,  SICINIUS and BRUTUS. The Senators take their  places, the Tribunes take their Places by themselves. CORIOLANUS stands"

25736,Coriolanus,8,2.2.42,MENENIUS,"please you,"
25737,Coriolanus,8,2.2.43,MENENIUS,"Most reverend and grave elders, to desire"
25738,Coriolanus,8,2.2.44,MENENIUS,"The present consul, and last general"
25739,Coriolanus,8,2.2.45,MENENIUS,"In our well-found successes, to report"
25740,Coriolanus,8,2.2.46,MENENIUS,A little of that worthy work perform'd
25741,Coriolanus,8,2.2.47,MENENIUS,"By Caius Marcius Coriolanus, whom"
25742,Coriolanus,8,2.2.48,MENENIUS,We met here both to thank and to remember
25743,Coriolanus,8,2.2.49,MENENIUS,With honours like himself.
25744,Coriolanus,9,2.2.50,First Senator,"Speak, good Cominius:"
25745,Coriolanus,9,2.2.51,First Senator,"Leave nothing out for length, and make us think"
25746,Coriolanus,9,2.2.52,First Senator,Rather our state's defective for requital
25747,Coriolanus,9,2.2.53,First Senator,Than we to stretch it out.
25748,Coriolanus,9,,First Senator,To the Tribunes
25749,Coriolanus,9,2.2.54,First Senator,"Masters o' the people,"
25750,Coriolanus,9,2.2.55,First Senator,"We do request your kindest ears, and after,"
25751,Coriolanus,9,2.2.56,First Senator,"Your loving motion toward the common body,"
25752,Coriolanus,9,2.2.57,First Senator,To yield what passes here.
25753,Coriolanus,10,2.2.58,SICINIUS,We are convented
25754,Coriolanus,10,2.2.59,SICINIUS,"Upon a pleasing treaty, and have hearts"
25755,Coriolanus,10,2.2.60,SICINIUS,Inclinable to honour and advance
25756,Coriolanus,10,2.2.61,SICINIUS,The theme of our assembly.
25757,Coriolanus,11,2.2.62,BRUTUS,Which the rather
25758,Coriolanus,11,2.2.63,BRUTUS,"We shall be blest to do, if he remember"
25759,Coriolanus,11,2.2.64,BRUTUS,A kinder value of the people than
25760,Coriolanus,11,2.2.65,BRUTUS,He hath hereto prized them at.
25761,Coriolanus,12,2.2.66,MENENIUS,"That's off, that's off,"
25762,Coriolanus,12,2.2.67,MENENIUS,I would you rather had been silent. Please you
25763,Coriolanus,12,2.2.68,MENENIUS,To hear Cominius speak?
25764,Coriolanus,13,2.2.69,BRUTUS,"Most willingly,"
25765,Coriolanus,13,2.2.70,BRUTUS,But yet my caution was more pertinent
25766,Coriolanus,13,2.2.71,BRUTUS,Than the rebuke you give it.
25767,Coriolanus,14,2.2.72,MENENIUS,He loves your people
25768,Coriolanus,14,2.2.73,MENENIUS,But tie him not to be their bedfellow.
25769,Coriolanus,14,2.2.74,MENENIUS,"Worthy Cominius, speak."
25770,Coriolanus,14,,MENENIUS,CORIOLANUS offers to go away
25771,Coriolanus,14,2.2.75,MENENIUS,"Nay, keep your place."
25772,Coriolanus,15,2.2.76,First Senator,"Sit, Coriolanus, never shame to hear"
25773,Coriolanus,15,2.2.77,First Senator,What you have nobly done.
25774,Coriolanus,16,2.2.78,CORIOLANUS,Your horror's pardon:
25775,Coriolanus,16,2.2.79,CORIOLANUS,I had rather have my wounds to heal again
25776,Coriolanus,16,2.2.80,CORIOLANUS,Than hear say how I got them.
25777,Coriolanus,17,2.2.81,BRUTUS,"Sir, I hope"
25778,Coriolanus,17,2.2.82,BRUTUS,My words disbench'd you not.
25779,Coriolanus,18,2.2.83,CORIOLANUS,"No, sir: yet oft,"
25780,Coriolanus,18,2.2.84,CORIOLANUS,"When blows have made me stay, I fled from words."
25781,Coriolanus,18,2.2.85,CORIOLANUS,"You soothed not, therefore hurt not: but"
25782,Coriolanus,18,2.2.86,CORIOLANUS,"your people,"
25783,Coriolanus,18,2.2.87,CORIOLANUS,I love them as they weigh.
25784,Coriolanus,19,2.2.88,MENENIUS,"Pray now, sit down."
25785,Coriolanus,20,2.2.89,CORIOLANUS,I had rather have one scratch my head i' the sun
25786,Coriolanus,20,2.2.90,CORIOLANUS,When the alarum were struck than idly sit
25787,Coriolanus,20,2.2.91,CORIOLANUS,To hear my nothings monster'd.
25788,Coriolanus,20,,CORIOLANUS,Exit
25789,Coriolanus,21,2.2.92,MENENIUS,"Masters of the people,"
25790,Coriolanus,21,2.2.93,MENENIUS,Your multiplying spawn how can he flatter--
25791,Coriolanus,21,2.2.94,MENENIUS,That's thousand to one good one--when you now see
25792,Coriolanus,21,2.2.95,MENENIUS,He had rather venture all his limbs for honour
25793,Coriolanus,21,2.2.96,MENENIUS,"Than one on's ears to hear it? Proceed, Cominius."
25794,Coriolanus,22,2.2.97,COMINIUS,I shall lack voice: the deeds of Coriolanus
25795,Coriolanus,22,2.2.98,COMINIUS,Should not be utter'd feebly. It is held
25796,Coriolanus,22,2.2.99,COMINIUS,"That valour is the chiefest virtue, and"
25797,Coriolanus,22,2.2.100,COMINIUS,"Most dignifies the haver: if it be,"
25798,Coriolanus,22,2.2.101,COMINIUS,The man I speak of cannot in the world
25799,Coriolanus,22,2.2.102,COMINIUS,"Be singly counterpoised. At sixteen years,"
25800,Coriolanus,22,2.2.103,COMINIUS,"When Tarquin made a head for Rome, he fought"
25801,Coriolanus,22,2.2.104,COMINIUS,"Beyond the mark of others: our then dictator,"
25802,Coriolanus,22,2.2.105,COMINIUS,"Whom with all praise I point at, saw him fight,"
25803,Coriolanus,22,2.2.106,COMINIUS,When with his Amazonian chin he drove
25804,Coriolanus,22,2.2.107,COMINIUS,The bristled lips before him: be bestrid
25805,Coriolanus,22,2.2.108,COMINIUS,An o'er-press'd Roman and i' the consul's view
25806,Coriolanus,22,2.2.109,COMINIUS,"Slew three opposers: Tarquin's self he met,"
25807,Coriolanus,22,2.2.110,COMINIUS,"And struck him on his knee: in that day's feats,"
25808,Coriolanus,22,2.2.111,COMINIUS,"When he might act the woman in the scene,"
25809,Coriolanus,22,2.2.112,COMINIUS,"He proved best man i' the field, and for his meed"
25810,Coriolanus,22,2.2.113,COMINIUS,Was brow-bound with the oak. His pupil age
25811,Coriolanus,22,2.2.114,COMINIUS,"Man-enter'd thus, he waxed like a sea,"
25812,Coriolanus,22,2.2.115,COMINIUS,And in the brunt of seventeen battles since
25813,Coriolanus,22,2.2.116,COMINIUS,"He lurch'd all swords of the garland. For this last,"
25814,Coriolanus,22,2.2.117,COMINIUS,"Before and in Corioli, let me say,"
25815,Coriolanus,22,2.2.118,COMINIUS,"I cannot speak him home: he stopp'd the fliers,"
25816,Coriolanus,22,2.2.119,COMINIUS,And by his rare example made the coward
25817,Coriolanus,22,2.2.120,COMINIUS,Turn terror into sport: as weeds before
25818,Coriolanus,22,2.2.121,COMINIUS,"A vessel under sail, so men obey'd"
25819,Coriolanus,22,2.2.122,COMINIUS,"And fell below his stem: his sword, death's stamp,"
25820,Coriolanus,22,2.2.123,COMINIUS,"Where it did mark, it took, from face to foot"
25821,Coriolanus,22,2.2.124,COMINIUS,"He was a thing of blood, whose every motion"
25822,Coriolanus,22,2.2.125,COMINIUS,Was timed with dying cries: alone he enter'd
25823,Coriolanus,22,2.2.126,COMINIUS,"The mortal gate of the city, which he painted"
25824,Coriolanus,22,2.2.127,COMINIUS,"With shunless destiny, aidless came off,"
25825,Coriolanus,22,2.2.128,COMINIUS,And with a sudden reinforcement struck
25826,Coriolanus,22,2.2.129,COMINIUS,Corioli like a planet: now all's his:
25827,Coriolanus,22,2.2.130,COMINIUS,"When, by and by, the din of war gan pierce"
25828,Coriolanus,22,2.2.131,COMINIUS,"His ready sense, then straight his doubled spirit"
25829,Coriolanus,22,2.2.132,COMINIUS,"Re-quicken'd what in flesh was fatigate,"
25830,Coriolanus,22,2.2.133,COMINIUS,"And to the battle came he, where he did"
25831,Coriolanus,22,2.2.134,COMINIUS,"Run reeking o'er the lives of men, as if"
25832,Coriolanus,22,2.2.135,COMINIUS,'Twere a perpetual spoil: and till we call'd
25833,Coriolanus,22,2.2.136,COMINIUS,"Both field and city ours, he never stood"
25834,Coriolanus,22,2.2.137,COMINIUS,To ease his breast with panting.
25835,Coriolanus,23,2.2.138,MENENIUS,Worthy man!
25836,Coriolanus,24,2.2.139,First Senator,He cannot but with measure fit the honours
25837,Coriolanus,24,2.2.140,First Senator,Which we devise him.
25838,Coriolanus,25,2.2.141,COMINIUS,"Our spoils he kick'd at,"
25839,Coriolanus,25,2.2.142,COMINIUS,And look'd upon things precious as they were
25840,Coriolanus,25,2.2.143,COMINIUS,The common muck of the world: he covets less
25841,Coriolanus,25,2.2.144,COMINIUS,"Than misery itself would give, rewards"
25842,Coriolanus,25,2.2.145,COMINIUS,"His deeds with doing them, and is content"
25843,Coriolanus,25,2.2.146,COMINIUS,To spend the time to end it.
25844,Coriolanus,26,2.2.147,MENENIUS,He's right noble:
25845,Coriolanus,26,2.2.148,MENENIUS,Let him be call'd for.
25846,Coriolanus,27,2.2.149,First Senator,Call Coriolanus.
25847,Coriolanus,28,2.2.150,Officer,He doth appear.
25848,Coriolanus,28,,Officer,Re-enter CORIOLANUS
25849,Coriolanus,29,2.2.151,MENENIUS,"The senate, Coriolanus, are well pleased"
25850,Coriolanus,29,2.2.152,MENENIUS,To make thee consul.
25851,Coriolanus,30,2.2.153,CORIOLANUS,I do owe them still
25852,Coriolanus,30,2.2.154,CORIOLANUS,My life and services.
25853,Coriolanus,31,2.2.155,MENENIUS,It then remains
25854,Coriolanus,31,2.2.156,MENENIUS,That you do speak to the people.
25855,Coriolanus,32,2.2.157,CORIOLANUS,"I do beseech you,"
25856,Coriolanus,32,2.2.158,CORIOLANUS,"Let me o'erleap that custom, for I cannot"
25857,Coriolanus,32,2.2.159,CORIOLANUS,"Put on the gown, stand naked and entreat them,"
25858,Coriolanus,32,2.2.160,CORIOLANUS,"For my wounds' sake, to give their suffrage: please you"
25859,Coriolanus,32,2.2.161,CORIOLANUS,That I may pass this doing.
25860,Coriolanus,33,2.2.162,SICINIUS,"Sir, the people"
25861,Coriolanus,33,2.2.163,SICINIUS,"Must have their voices, neither will they bate"
25862,Coriolanus,33,2.2.164,SICINIUS,One jot of ceremony.
25863,Coriolanus,34,2.2.165,MENENIUS,Put them not to't:
25864,Coriolanus,34,2.2.166,MENENIUS,"Pray you, go fit you to the custom and"
25865,Coriolanus,34,2.2.167,MENENIUS,"Take to you, as your predecessors have,"
25866,Coriolanus,34,2.2.168,MENENIUS,Your honour with your form.
25867,Coriolanus,35,2.2.169,CORIOLANUS,It is apart
25868,Coriolanus,35,2.2.170,CORIOLANUS,"That I shall blush in acting, and might well"
25869,Coriolanus,35,2.2.171,CORIOLANUS,Be taken from the people.
25870,Coriolanus,36,2.2.172,BRUTUS,Mark you that?
25871,Coriolanus,37,2.2.173,CORIOLANUS,"To brag unto them, thus I did, and thus,"
25872,Coriolanus,37,2.2.174,CORIOLANUS,"Show them the unaching scars which I should hide,"
25873,Coriolanus,37,2.2.175,CORIOLANUS,As if I had received them for the hire
25874,Coriolanus,37,2.2.176,CORIOLANUS,Of their breath only!
25875,Coriolanus,38,2.2.177,MENENIUS,Do not stand upon't.
25876,Coriolanus,38,2.2.178,MENENIUS,"We recommend to you, tribunes of the people,"
25877,Coriolanus,38,2.2.179,MENENIUS,Our purpose to them: and to our noble consul
25878,Coriolanus,38,2.2.180,MENENIUS,Wish we all joy and honour.
25879,Coriolanus,39,2.2.181,Senators,To Coriolanus come all joy and honour!
25880,Coriolanus,39,,Senators,Flourish of cornets. Exeunt all but SICINIUS and BRUTUS
25881,Coriolanus,40,2.2.182,BRUTUS,You see how he intends to use the people.
25882,Coriolanus,41,2.2.183,SICINIUS,"May they perceive's intent! He will require them,"
25883,Coriolanus,41,2.2.184,SICINIUS,As if he did contemn what he requested
25884,Coriolanus,41,2.2.185,SICINIUS,Should be in them to give.
25885,Coriolanus,42,2.2.186,BRUTUS,"Come, we'll inform them"
25886,Coriolanus,42,2.2.187,BRUTUS,"Of our proceedings here: on the marketplace,"
25887,Coriolanus,42,2.2.188,BRUTUS,"I know, they do attend us."
25888,Coriolanus,42,,BRUTUS,Exeunt
25889,Coriolanus,42,,BRUTUS,SCENE III. The same. The Forum.
25890,Coriolanus,42,,BRUTUS,Enter seven or eight Citizens
25891,Coriolanus,1,2.3.1,First Citizen,"Once, if he do require our voices, we ought not to deny him."
25892,Coriolanus,2,2.3.2,Second Citizen,"We may, sir, if we will."
25893,Coriolanus,3,2.3.3,Third Citizen,"We have power in ourselves to do it, but it is a"
25894,Coriolanus,3,2.3.4,Third Citizen,"power that we have no power to do, for if he show us"
25895,Coriolanus,3,2.3.5,Third Citizen,"his wounds and tell us his deeds, we are to put our"
25896,Coriolanus,3,2.3.6,Third Citizen,"tongues into those wounds and speak for them, so, if"
25897,Coriolanus,3,2.3.7,Third Citizen,"he tell us his noble deeds, we must also tell him"
25898,Coriolanus,3,2.3.8,Third Citizen,our noble acceptance of them. Ingratitude is
25899,Coriolanus,3,2.3.9,Third Citizen,"monstrous, and for the multitude to be ingrateful,"
25900,Coriolanus,3,2.3.10,Third Citizen,were to make a monster of the multitude: of the
25901,Coriolanus,3,2.3.11,Third Citizen,"which we being members, should bring ourselves to be"
25902,Coriolanus,3,2.3.12,Third Citizen,monstrous members.
25903,Coriolanus,4,2.3.13,First Citizen,"And to make us no better thought of, a little help"
25904,Coriolanus,4,2.3.14,First Citizen,"will serve, for once we stood up about the corn, he"
25905,Coriolanus,4,2.3.15,First Citizen,himself stuck not to call us the many-headed multitude.
25906,Coriolanus,5,2.3.16,Third Citizen,"We have been called so of many, not that our heads"
25907,Coriolanus,5,2.3.17,Third Citizen,"are some brown, some black, some auburn, some bald,"
25908,Coriolanus,5,2.3.18,Third Citizen,but that our wits are so diversely coloured: and
25909,Coriolanus,5,2.3.19,Third Citizen,truly I think if all our wits were to issue out of
25910,Coriolanus,5,2.3.20,Third Citizen,"one skull, they would fly east, west, north, south,"
25911,Coriolanus,5,2.3.21,Third Citizen,and their consent of one direct way should be at
25912,Coriolanus,5,2.3.22,Third Citizen,once to all the points o' the compass.
25913,Coriolanus,6,2.3.23,Second Citizen,Think you so? Which way do you judge my wit would
25914,Coriolanus,6,2.3.24,Second Citizen,fly?
25915,Coriolanus,7,2.3.25,Third Citizen,"Nay, your wit will not so soon out as another man's"
25916,Coriolanus,7,2.3.26,Third Citizen,"will,'tis strongly wedged up in a block-head, but"
25917,Coriolanus,7,2.3.27,Third Citizen,"if it were at liberty, 'twould, sure, southward."
25918,Coriolanus,8,2.3.28,Second Citizen,Why that way?
25919,Coriolanus,9,2.3.29,Third Citizen,"To lose itself in a fog, where being three parts"
25920,Coriolanus,9,2.3.30,Third Citizen,"melted away with rotten dews, the fourth would return"
25921,Coriolanus,9,2.3.31,Third Citizen,"for conscience sake, to help to get thee a wife."
25922,Coriolanus,10,2.3.32,Second Citizen,"You are never without your tricks: you may, you may."
25923,Coriolanus,11,2.3.33,Third Citizen,Are you all resolved to give your voices? But
25924,Coriolanus,11,2.3.34,Third Citizen,"that's no matter, the greater part carries it. I"
25925,Coriolanus,11,2.3.35,Third Citizen,"say, if he would incline to the people, there was"
25926,Coriolanus,11,2.3.36,Third Citizen,never a worthier man.
25927,Coriolanus,11,,Third Citizen,"Enter CORIOLANUS in a gown of humility, with MENENIUS"
25928,Coriolanus,11,2.3.37,Third Citizen,"Here he comes, and in the gown of humility: mark his"
25929,Coriolanus,11,2.3.38,Third Citizen,"behavior. We are not to stay all together, but to"
25930,Coriolanus,11,2.3.39,Third Citizen,"come by him where he stands, by ones, by twos, and"
25931,Coriolanus,11,2.3.40,Third Citizen,by threes. He's to make his requests by
25932,Coriolanus,11,2.3.41,Third Citizen,"particulars, wherein every one of us has a single"
25933,Coriolanus,11,2.3.42,Third Citizen,"honour, in giving him our own voices with our own"
25934,Coriolanus,11,2.3.43,Third Citizen,"tongues: therefore follow me, and I direct you how"
25935,Coriolanus,11,2.3.44,Third Citizen,you shall go by him.
25936,Coriolanus,12,2.3.45,All,"Content, content."
25937,Coriolanus,12,,All,Exeunt Citizens
25938,Coriolanus,13,2.3.46,MENENIUS,"O sir, you are not right: have you not known"
25939,Coriolanus,13,2.3.47,MENENIUS,The worthiest men have done't?
25940,Coriolanus,14,2.3.48,CORIOLANUS,What must I say?
25941,Coriolanus,14,2.3.49,CORIOLANUS,"'I Pray, sir'--Plague upon't! I cannot bring"
25942,Coriolanus,14,2.3.50,CORIOLANUS,"My tongue to such a pace:--'Look, sir, my wounds!"
25943,Coriolanus,14,2.3.51,CORIOLANUS,"I got them in my country's service, when"
25944,Coriolanus,14,2.3.52,CORIOLANUS,Some certain of your brethren roar'd and ran
25945,Coriolanus,14,2.3.53,CORIOLANUS,From the noise of our own drums.'
25946,Coriolanus,15,2.3.54,MENENIUS,"O me, the gods!"
25947,Coriolanus,15,2.3.55,MENENIUS,You must not speak of that: you must desire them
25948,Coriolanus,15,2.3.56,MENENIUS,To think upon you.
25949,Coriolanus,16,2.3.57,CORIOLANUS,Think upon me! hang 'em!
25950,Coriolanus,16,2.3.58,CORIOLANUS,"I would they would forget me, like the virtues"
25951,Coriolanus,16,2.3.59,CORIOLANUS,Which our divines lose by 'em.
25952,Coriolanus,17,2.3.60,MENENIUS,You'll mar all:
25953,Coriolanus,17,2.3.61,MENENIUS,"I'll leave you: pray you, speak to 'em, I pray you,"
25954,Coriolanus,17,2.3.62,MENENIUS,In wholesome manner.
25955,Coriolanus,17,,MENENIUS,Exit
25956,Coriolanus,18,2.3.63,CORIOLANUS,Bid them wash their faces
25957,Coriolanus,18,2.3.64,CORIOLANUS,And keep their teeth clean.
25958,Coriolanus,18,,CORIOLANUS,Re-enter two of the Citizens
25959,Coriolanus,18,2.3.65,CORIOLANUS,"So, here comes a brace."
25960,Coriolanus,18,,CORIOLANUS,Re-enter a third Citizen
25961,Coriolanus,18,2.3.66,CORIOLANUS,"You know the cause, air, of my standing here."
25962,Coriolanus,19,2.3.67,Third Citizen,"We do, sir, tell us what hath brought you to't."
25963,Coriolanus,20,2.3.68,CORIOLANUS,Mine own desert.
25964,Coriolanus,21,2.3.69,Second Citizen,Your own desert!
25965,Coriolanus,22,2.3.70,CORIOLANUS,"Ay, but not mine own desire."
25966,Coriolanus,23,2.3.71,Third Citizen,How not your own desire?
25967,Coriolanus,24,2.3.72,CORIOLANUS,"No, sir,'twas never my desire yet to trouble the"
25968,Coriolanus,24,2.3.73,CORIOLANUS,poor with begging.
25969,Coriolanus,25,2.3.74,Third Citizen,"You must think, if we give you any thing, we hope to"
25970,Coriolanus,25,2.3.75,Third Citizen,gain by you.
25971,Coriolanus,26,2.3.76,CORIOLANUS,"Well then, I pray, your price o' the consulship?"
25972,Coriolanus,27,2.3.77,First Citizen,The price is to ask it kindly.
25973,Coriolanus,28,2.3.78,CORIOLANUS,"Kindly! Sir, I pray, let me ha't: I have wounds to"
25974,Coriolanus,28,2.3.79,CORIOLANUS,"show you, which shall be yours in private. Your"
25975,Coriolanus,28,2.3.80,CORIOLANUS,"good voice, sir, what say you?"
25976,Coriolanus,29,2.3.81,Second Citizen,"You shall ha' it, worthy sir."
25977,Coriolanus,30,2.3.82,CORIOLANUS,"A match, sir. There's in all two worthy voices"
25978,Coriolanus,30,2.3.83,CORIOLANUS,begged. I have your alms: adieu.
25979,Coriolanus,31,2.3.84,Third Citizen,But this is something odd.
25980,Coriolanus,32,2.3.85,Second Citizen,"An 'twere to give again,--but 'tis no matter."

25984,Coriolanus,33,2.3.87,CORIOLANUS,"voices that I may be consul, I have here the"
25985,Coriolanus,33,2.3.88,CORIOLANUS,customary gown.
25986,Coriolanus,34,2.3.89,Fourth Citizen,"You have deserved nobly of your country, and you"
25987,Coriolanus,34,2.3.90,Fourth Citizen,have not deserved nobly.
25988,Coriolanus,35,2.3.91,CORIOLANUS,Your enigma?
25989,Coriolanus,36,2.3.92,Fourth Citizen,"You have been a scourge to her enemies, you have"
25990,Coriolanus,36,2.3.93,Fourth Citizen,"been a rod to her friends, you have not indeed loved"
25991,Coriolanus,36,2.3.94,Fourth Citizen,the common people.
25992,Coriolanus,37,2.3.95,CORIOLANUS,You should account me the more virtuous that I have
25993,Coriolanus,37,2.3.96,CORIOLANUS,"not been common in my love. I will, sir, flatter my"
25994,Coriolanus,37,2.3.97,CORIOLANUS,"sworn brother, the people, to earn a dearer"
25995,Coriolanus,37,2.3.98,CORIOLANUS,"estimation of them, 'tis a condition they account"
25996,Coriolanus,37,2.3.99,CORIOLANUS,gentle: and since the wisdom of their choice is
25997,Coriolanus,37,2.3.100,CORIOLANUS,"rather to have my hat than my heart, I will practise"
25998,Coriolanus,37,2.3.101,CORIOLANUS,the insinuating nod and be off to them most
25999,Coriolanus,37,2.3.102,CORIOLANUS,"counterfeitly, that is, sir, I will counterfeit the"
26000,Coriolanus,37,2.3.103,CORIOLANUS,bewitchment of some popular man and give it
26001,Coriolanus,37,2.3.104,CORIOLANUS,"bountiful to the desirers. Therefore, beseech you,"
26002,Coriolanus,37,2.3.105,CORIOLANUS,I may be consul.
26003,Coriolanus,38,2.3.106,Fifth Citizen,"We hope to find you our friend, and therefore give"
26004,Coriolanus,38,2.3.107,Fifth Citizen,you our voices heartily.
26005,Coriolanus,39,2.3.108,Fourth Citizen,You have received many wounds for your country.
26006,Coriolanus,40,2.3.109,CORIOLANUS,I will not seal your knowledge with showing them. I
26007,Coriolanus,40,2.3.110,CORIOLANUS,"will make much of your voices, and so trouble you no further."
26008,Coriolanus,41,2.3.111,Both Citizens,"The gods give you joy, sir, heartily!"

26012,Coriolanus,42,2.3.114,CORIOLANUS,Than crave the hire which first we do deserve.
26013,Coriolanus,42,2.3.115,CORIOLANUS,"Why in this woolvish toge should I stand here,"
26014,Coriolanus,42,2.3.116,CORIOLANUS,"To beg of Hob and Dick, that do appear,"
26015,Coriolanus,42,2.3.117,CORIOLANUS,Their needless vouches? Custom calls me to't:
26016,Coriolanus,42,2.3.118,CORIOLANUS,"What custom wills, in all things should we do't,"
26017,Coriolanus,42,2.3.119,CORIOLANUS,"The dust on antique time would lie unswept,"
26018,Coriolanus,42,2.3.120,CORIOLANUS,And mountainous error be too highly heapt
26019,Coriolanus,42,2.3.121,CORIOLANUS,"For truth to o'er-peer. Rather than fool it so,"
26020,Coriolanus,42,2.3.122,CORIOLANUS,Let the high office and the honour go
26021,Coriolanus,42,2.3.123,CORIOLANUS,"To one that would do thus. I am half through,"
26022,Coriolanus,42,2.3.124,CORIOLANUS,"The one part suffer'd, the other will I do."

26027,Coriolanus,42,2.3.128,CORIOLANUS,"Of wounds two dozen odd, battles thrice six"
26028,Coriolanus,42,2.3.129,CORIOLANUS,"I have seen and heard of, for your voices have"
26029,Coriolanus,42,2.3.130,CORIOLANUS,"Done many things, some less, some more your voices:"
26030,Coriolanus,42,2.3.131,CORIOLANUS,Indeed I would be consul.
26031,Coriolanus,43,2.3.132,Sixth Citizen,"He has done nobly, and cannot go without any honest"

26041,Coriolanus,47,2.3.140,MENENIUS,"That, in the official marks invested, you"
26042,Coriolanus,47,2.3.141,MENENIUS,Anon do meet the senate.
26043,Coriolanus,48,2.3.142,CORIOLANUS,Is this done?
26044,Coriolanus,49,2.3.143,SICINIUS,The custom of request you have discharged:
26045,Coriolanus,49,2.3.144,SICINIUS,"The people do admit you, and are summon'd"
26046,Coriolanus,49,2.3.145,SICINIUS,"To meet anon, upon your approbation."

26048,Coriolanus,51,2.3.147,SICINIUS,"There, Coriolanus."
26049,Coriolanus,52,2.3.148,CORIOLANUS,May I change these garments?
26050,Coriolanus,53,2.3.149,SICINIUS,"You may, sir."
26051,Coriolanus,54,2.3.150,CORIOLANUS,"That I'll straight do, and, knowing myself again,"

26064,Coriolanus,61,2.3.161,BRUTUS,We pray the gods he may deserve your loves.
26065,Coriolanus,62,2.3.162,Second Citizen,"Amen, sir: to my poor unworthy notice,"
26066,Coriolanus,62,2.3.163,Second Citizen,He mock'd us when he begg'd our voices.
26067,Coriolanus,63,2.3.164,Third Citizen,Certainly
26068,Coriolanus,63,2.3.165,Third Citizen,He flouted us downright.
26069,Coriolanus,64,2.3.166,First Citizen,"No,'tis his kind of speech: he did not mock us."
26070,Coriolanus,65,2.3.167,Second Citizen,"Not one amongst us, save yourself, but says"
26071,Coriolanus,65,2.3.168,Second Citizen,He used us scornfully: he should have show'd us

26073,Coriolanus,66,2.3.170,SICINIUS,"Why, so he did, I am sure."

26079,Coriolanus,68,2.3.176,Third Citizen,"But by your voices, will not so permit me,"
26080,Coriolanus,68,2.3.177,Third Citizen,"Your voices therefore.' When we granted that,"
26081,Coriolanus,68,2.3.178,Third Citizen,Here was 'I thank you for your voices: thank you:
26082,Coriolanus,68,2.3.179,Third Citizen,Your most sweet voices: now you have left
26083,Coriolanus,68,2.3.180,Third Citizen,"your voices,"
26084,Coriolanus,68,2.3.181,Third Citizen,I have no further with you.' Was not this mockery?
26085,Coriolanus,69,2.3.182,SICINIUS,"Why either were you ignorant to see't,"
26086,Coriolanus,69,2.3.183,SICINIUS,"Or, seeing it, of such childish friendliness"
26087,Coriolanus,69,2.3.184,SICINIUS,To yield your voices?
26088,Coriolanus,70,2.3.185,BRUTUS,Could you not have told him
26089,Coriolanus,70,2.3.186,BRUTUS,"As you were lesson'd, when he had no power,"
26090,Coriolanus,70,2.3.187,BRUTUS,"But was a petty servant to the state,"
26091,Coriolanus,70,2.3.188,BRUTUS,"He was your enemy, ever spake against"
26092,Coriolanus,70,2.3.189,BRUTUS,Your liberties and the charters that you bear
26093,Coriolanus,70,2.3.190,BRUTUS,"I' the body of the weal, and now, arriving"
26094,Coriolanus,70,2.3.191,BRUTUS,"A place of potency and sway o' the state,"
26095,Coriolanus,70,2.3.192,BRUTUS,If he should still malignantly remain
26096,Coriolanus,70,2.3.193,BRUTUS,"Fast foe to the plebeii, your voices might"
26097,Coriolanus,70,2.3.194,BRUTUS,Be curses to yourselves? You should have said
26098,Coriolanus,70,2.3.195,BRUTUS,That as his worthy deeds did claim no less
26099,Coriolanus,70,2.3.196,BRUTUS,"Than what he stood for, so his gracious nature"
26100,Coriolanus,70,2.3.197,BRUTUS,Would think upon you for your voices and
26101,Coriolanus,70,2.3.198,BRUTUS,"Translate his malice towards you into love,"
26102,Coriolanus,70,2.3.199,BRUTUS,Standing your friendly lord.
26103,Coriolanus,71,2.3.200,SICINIUS,"Thus to have said,"
26104,Coriolanus,71,2.3.201,SICINIUS,"As you were fore-advised, had touch'd his spirit"
26105,Coriolanus,71,2.3.202,SICINIUS,"And tried his inclination, from him pluck'd"
26106,Coriolanus,71,2.3.203,SICINIUS,"Either his gracious promise, which you might,"
26107,Coriolanus,71,2.3.204,SICINIUS,"As cause had call'd you up, have held him to"
26108,Coriolanus,71,2.3.205,SICINIUS,"Or else it would have gall'd his surly nature,"
26109,Coriolanus,71,2.3.206,SICINIUS,Which easily endures not article
26110,Coriolanus,71,2.3.207,SICINIUS,"Tying him to aught, so putting him to rage,"
26111,Coriolanus,71,2.3.208,SICINIUS,You should have ta'en the advantage of his choler
26112,Coriolanus,71,2.3.209,SICINIUS,And pass'd him unelected.
26113,Coriolanus,72,2.3.210,BRUTUS,Did you perceive
26114,Coriolanus,72,2.3.211,BRUTUS,He did solicit you in free contempt
26115,Coriolanus,72,2.3.212,BRUTUS,"When he did need your loves, and do you think"
26116,Coriolanus,72,2.3.213,BRUTUS,"That his contempt shall not be bruising to you,"
26117,Coriolanus,72,2.3.214,BRUTUS,"When he hath power to crush? Why, had your bodies"
26118,Coriolanus,72,2.3.215,BRUTUS,No heart among you? or had you tongues to cry
26119,Coriolanus,72,2.3.216,BRUTUS,Against the rectorship of judgment?
26120,Coriolanus,73,2.3.217,SICINIUS,Have you
26121,Coriolanus,73,2.3.218,SICINIUS,Ere now denied the asker? and now again
26122,Coriolanus,73,2.3.219,SICINIUS,"Of him that did not ask, but mock, bestow"
26123,Coriolanus,73,2.3.220,SICINIUS,Your sued-for tongues?
26124,Coriolanus,74,2.3.221,Third Citizen,"He's not confirm'd, we may deny him yet."
26125,Coriolanus,75,2.3.222,Second Citizen,And will deny him:
26126,Coriolanus,75,2.3.223,Second Citizen,I'll have five hundred voices of that sound.
26127,Coriolanus,76,2.3.224,First Citizen,I twice five hundred and their friends to piece 'em.
26128,Coriolanus,77,2.3.225,BRUTUS,"Get you hence instantly, and tell those friends,"
26129,Coriolanus,77,2.3.226,BRUTUS,They have chose a consul that will from them take
26130,Coriolanus,77,2.3.227,BRUTUS,"Their liberties, make them of no more voice"
26131,Coriolanus,77,2.3.228,BRUTUS,Than dogs that are as often beat for barking
26132,Coriolanus,77,2.3.229,BRUTUS,As therefore kept to do so.
26133,Coriolanus,78,2.3.230,SICINIUS,"Let them assemble,"
26134,Coriolanus,78,2.3.231,SICINIUS,And on a safer judgment all revoke
26135,Coriolanus,78,2.3.232,SICINIUS,"Your ignorant election, enforce his pride,"
26136,Coriolanus,78,2.3.233,SICINIUS,"And his old hate unto you, besides, forget not"
26137,Coriolanus,78,2.3.234,SICINIUS,"With what contempt he wore the humble weed,"
26138,Coriolanus,78,2.3.235,SICINIUS,"How in his suit he scorn'd you, but your loves,"
26139,Coriolanus,78,2.3.236,SICINIUS,"Thinking upon his services, took from you"
26140,Coriolanus,78,2.3.237,SICINIUS,"The apprehension of his present portance,"
26141,Coriolanus,78,2.3.238,SICINIUS,"Which most gibingly, ungravely, he did fashion"
26142,Coriolanus,78,2.3.239,SICINIUS,After the inveterate hate he bears you.
26143,Coriolanus,79,2.3.240,BRUTUS,Lay
26144,Coriolanus,79,2.3.241,BRUTUS,"A fault on us, your tribunes, that we laboured,"
26145,Coriolanus,79,2.3.242,BRUTUS,"No impediment between, but that you must"
26146,Coriolanus,79,2.3.243,BRUTUS,Cast your election on him.
26147,Coriolanus,80,2.3.244,SICINIUS,"Say, you chose him"
26148,Coriolanus,80,2.3.245,SICINIUS,More after our commandment than as guided
26149,Coriolanus,80,2.3.246,SICINIUS,"By your own true affections, and that your minds,"
26150,Coriolanus,80,2.3.247,SICINIUS,Preoccupied with what you rather must do
26151,Coriolanus,80,2.3.248,SICINIUS,"Than what you should, made you against the grain"
26152,Coriolanus,80,2.3.249,SICINIUS,To voice him consul: lay the fault on us.
26153,Coriolanus,81,2.3.250,BRUTUS,"Ay, spare us not. Say we read lectures to you."
26154,Coriolanus,81,2.3.251,BRUTUS,"How youngly he began to serve his country,"
26155,Coriolanus,81,2.3.252,BRUTUS,"How long continued, and what stock he springs of,"
26156,Coriolanus,81,2.3.253,BRUTUS,"The noble house o' the Marcians, from whence came"
26157,Coriolanus,81,2.3.254,BRUTUS,"That Ancus Marcius, Numa's daughter's son,"
26158,Coriolanus,81,2.3.255,BRUTUS,"Who, after great Hostilius, here was king,"
26159,Coriolanus,81,2.3.256,BRUTUS,"Of the same house Publius and Quintus were,"
26160,Coriolanus,81,2.3.257,BRUTUS,"That our beat water brought by conduits hither,"
26161,Coriolanus,81,2.3.258,BRUTUS,"And  [Censorinus,]  nobly named so,"

26163,Coriolanus,81,2.3.260,BRUTUS,Was his great ancestor.
26164,Coriolanus,82,2.3.261,SICINIUS,"One thus descended,"
26165,Coriolanus,82,2.3.262,SICINIUS,That hath beside well in his person wrought
26166,Coriolanus,82,2.3.263,SICINIUS,"To be set high in place, we did commend"
26167,Coriolanus,82,2.3.264,SICINIUS,"To your remembrances: but you have found,"
26168,Coriolanus,82,2.3.265,SICINIUS,"Scaling his present bearing with his past,"
26169,Coriolanus,82,2.3.266,SICINIUS,"That he's your fixed enemy, and revoke"
26170,Coriolanus,82,2.3.267,SICINIUS,Your sudden approbation.
26171,Coriolanus,83,2.3.268,BRUTUS,"Say, you ne'er had done't--"
26172,Coriolanus,83,2.3.269,BRUTUS,"Harp on that still--but by our putting on,"
26173,Coriolanus,83,2.3.270,BRUTUS,"And presently, when you have drawn your number,"
26174,Coriolanus,83,2.3.271,BRUTUS,Repair to the Capitol.
26175,Coriolanus,84,2.3.272,All,We will so: almost all
26176,Coriolanus,84,2.3.273,All,Repent in their election.
26177,Coriolanus,84,,All,Exeunt Citizens
26178,Coriolanus,85,2.3.274,BRUTUS,"Let them go on,"
26179,Coriolanus,85,2.3.275,BRUTUS,"This mutiny were better put in hazard,"
26180,Coriolanus,85,2.3.276,BRUTUS,"Than stay, past doubt, for greater:"
26181,Coriolanus,85,2.3.277,BRUTUS,"If, as his nature is, he fall in rage"
26182,Coriolanus,85,2.3.278,BRUTUS,"With their refusal, both observe and answer"
26183,Coriolanus,85,2.3.279,BRUTUS,The vantage of his anger.
26184,Coriolanus,86,2.3.280,SICINIUS,"To the Capitol, come:"
26185,Coriolanus,86,2.3.281,SICINIUS,"We will be there before the stream o' the people,"
26186,Coriolanus,86,2.3.282,SICINIUS,"And this shall seem, as partly 'tis, their own,"
26187,Coriolanus,86,2.3.283,SICINIUS,Which we have goaded onward.
26188,Coriolanus,86,,SICINIUS,Exeunt
26189,Coriolanus,86,,SICINIUS,ACT III
26190,Coriolanus,86,,SICINIUS,SCENE I. Rome. A street.
26191,Coriolanus,86,,SICINIUS,"Cornets. Enter CORIOLANUS, MENENIUS, all the Gentry, COMINIUS, TITUS LARTIUS, and other Senators"
26192,Coriolanus,1,3.1.1,CORIOLANUS,Tullus Aufidius then had made new head?
26193,Coriolanus,2,3.1.2,LARTIUS,"He had, my lord, and that it was which caused"
26194,Coriolanus,2,3.1.3,LARTIUS,Our swifter composition.
26195,Coriolanus,3,3.1.4,CORIOLANUS,"So then the Volsces stand but as at first,"
26196,Coriolanus,3,3.1.5,CORIOLANUS,"Ready, when time shall prompt them, to make road."
26197,Coriolanus,3,3.1.6,CORIOLANUS,Upon's again.
26198,Coriolanus,4,3.1.7,COMINIUS,"They are worn, lord consul, so,"
26199,Coriolanus,4,3.1.8,COMINIUS,That we shall hardly in our ages see
26200,Coriolanus,4,3.1.9,COMINIUS,Their banners wave again.
26201,Coriolanus,5,3.1.10,CORIOLANUS,Saw you Aufidius?
26202,Coriolanus,6,3.1.11,LARTIUS,"On safe-guard he  came to me, and did curse"
26203,Coriolanus,6,3.1.12,LARTIUS,"Against the Volsces, for they had so vilely"
26204,Coriolanus,6,3.1.13,LARTIUS,Yielded the town: he is retired to Antium.
26205,Coriolanus,7,3.1.14,CORIOLANUS,Spoke he of me?
26206,Coriolanus,8,3.1.15,LARTIUS,"He did, my lord."
26207,Coriolanus,9,3.1.16,CORIOLANUS,How? what?
26208,Coriolanus,10,3.1.17,LARTIUS,"How often he had met you, sword to sword,"
26209,Coriolanus,10,3.1.18,LARTIUS,That of all things upon the earth he hated
26210,Coriolanus,10,3.1.19,LARTIUS,"Your person most, that he would pawn his fortunes"
26211,Coriolanus,10,3.1.20,LARTIUS,"To hopeless restitution, so he might"
26212,Coriolanus,10,3.1.21,LARTIUS,Be call'd your vanquisher.
26213,Coriolanus,11,3.1.22,CORIOLANUS,At Antium lives he?
26214,Coriolanus,12,3.1.23,LARTIUS,At Antium.
26215,Coriolanus,13,3.1.24,CORIOLANUS,"I wish I had a cause to seek him there,"
26216,Coriolanus,13,3.1.25,CORIOLANUS,To oppose his hatred fully. Welcome home.
26217,Coriolanus,13,,CORIOLANUS,Enter SICINIUS and BRUTUS
26218,Coriolanus,13,3.1.26,CORIOLANUS,"Behold, these are the tribunes of the people,"
26219,Coriolanus,13,3.1.27,CORIOLANUS,"The tongues o' the common mouth: I do despise them,"
26220,Coriolanus,13,3.1.28,CORIOLANUS,"For they do prank them in authority,"
26221,Coriolanus,13,3.1.29,CORIOLANUS,Against all noble sufferance.
26222,Coriolanus,14,3.1.30,SICINIUS,Pass no further.
26223,Coriolanus,15,3.1.31,CORIOLANUS,Ha! what is that?
26224,Coriolanus,16,3.1.32,BRUTUS,It will be dangerous to go on: no further.
26225,Coriolanus,17,3.1.33,CORIOLANUS,What makes this change?
26226,Coriolanus,18,3.1.34,MENENIUS,The matter?
26227,Coriolanus,19,3.1.35,COMINIUS,Hath he not pass'd the noble and the common?
26228,Coriolanus,20,3.1.36,BRUTUS,"Cominius, no."
26229,Coriolanus,21,3.1.37,CORIOLANUS,Have I had children's voices?
26230,Coriolanus,22,3.1.38,First Senator,"Tribunes, give way, he shall to the market-place."
26231,Coriolanus,23,3.1.39,BRUTUS,The people are incensed against him.
26232,Coriolanus,24,3.1.40,SICINIUS,"Stop,"
26233,Coriolanus,24,3.1.41,SICINIUS,Or all will fall in broil.
26234,Coriolanus,25,3.1.42,CORIOLANUS,Are these your herd?
26235,Coriolanus,25,3.1.43,CORIOLANUS,"Must these have voices, that can yield them now"
26236,Coriolanus,25,3.1.44,CORIOLANUS,And straight disclaim their tongues? What are
26237,Coriolanus,25,3.1.45,CORIOLANUS,your offices?
26238,Coriolanus,25,3.1.46,CORIOLANUS,"You being their mouths, why rule you not their teeth?"
26239,Coriolanus,25,3.1.47,CORIOLANUS,Have you not set them on?
26240,Coriolanus,26,3.1.48,MENENIUS,"Be calm, be calm."
26241,Coriolanus,27,3.1.49,CORIOLANUS,"It is a purposed thing, and grows by plot,"
26242,Coriolanus,27,3.1.50,CORIOLANUS,To curb the will of the nobility:
26243,Coriolanus,27,3.1.51,CORIOLANUS,"Suffer't, and live with such as cannot rule"
26244,Coriolanus,27,3.1.52,CORIOLANUS,Nor ever will be ruled.
26245,Coriolanus,28,3.1.53,BRUTUS,Call't not a plot:
26246,Coriolanus,28,3.1.54,BRUTUS,"The people cry you mock'd them, and of late,"
26247,Coriolanus,28,3.1.55,BRUTUS,"When corn was given them gratis, you repined,"
26248,Coriolanus,28,3.1.56,BRUTUS,"Scandal'd the suppliants for the people, call'd them"
26249,Coriolanus,28,3.1.57,BRUTUS,"Time-pleasers, flatterers, foes to nobleness."
26250,Coriolanus,29,3.1.58,CORIOLANUS,"Why, this was known before."
26251,Coriolanus,30,3.1.59,BRUTUS,Not to them all.
26252,Coriolanus,31,3.1.60,CORIOLANUS,Have you inform'd them sithence?
26253,Coriolanus,32,3.1.61,BRUTUS,How! I inform them!
26254,Coriolanus,33,3.1.62,CORIOLANUS,You are like to do such business.
26255,Coriolanus,34,3.1.63,BRUTUS,"Not unlike,"
26256,Coriolanus,34,3.1.64,BRUTUS,"Each way, to better yours."
26257,Coriolanus,35,3.1.65,CORIOLANUS,"Why then should I be consul? By yond clouds,"
26258,Coriolanus,35,3.1.66,CORIOLANUS,"Let me deserve so ill as you, and make me"
26259,Coriolanus,35,3.1.67,CORIOLANUS,Your fellow tribune.
26260,Coriolanus,36,3.1.68,SICINIUS,You show too much of that
26261,Coriolanus,36,3.1.69,SICINIUS,For which the people stir: if you will pass
26262,Coriolanus,36,3.1.70,SICINIUS,"To where you are bound, you must inquire your way,"
26263,Coriolanus,36,3.1.71,SICINIUS,"Which you are out of, with a gentler spirit,"
26264,Coriolanus,36,3.1.72,SICINIUS,"Or never be so noble as a consul,"
26265,Coriolanus,36,3.1.73,SICINIUS,Nor yoke with him for tribune.
26266,Coriolanus,37,3.1.74,MENENIUS,Let's be calm.
26267,Coriolanus,38,3.1.75,COMINIUS,"The people are abused, set on. This paltering"
26268,Coriolanus,38,3.1.76,COMINIUS,"Becomes not Rome, nor has Coriolanus"
26269,Coriolanus,38,3.1.77,COMINIUS,"Deserved this so dishonour'd rub, laid falsely"
26270,Coriolanus,38,3.1.78,COMINIUS,I' the plain way of his merit.
26271,Coriolanus,39,3.1.79,CORIOLANUS,Tell me of corn!
26272,Coriolanus,39,3.1.80,CORIOLANUS,"This was my speech, and I will speak't again--"
26273,Coriolanus,40,3.1.81,MENENIUS,"Not now, not now."
26274,Coriolanus,41,3.1.82,First Senator,"Not in this heat, sir, now."
26275,Coriolanus,42,3.1.83,CORIOLANUS,"Now, as I live, I will. My nobler friends,"
26276,Coriolanus,42,3.1.84,CORIOLANUS,I crave their pardons:
26277,Coriolanus,42,3.1.85,CORIOLANUS,"For the mutable, rank-scented many, let them"
26278,Coriolanus,42,3.1.86,CORIOLANUS,"Regard me as I do not flatter, and"
26279,Coriolanus,42,3.1.87,CORIOLANUS,"Therein behold themselves: I say again,"
26280,Coriolanus,42,3.1.88,CORIOLANUS,"In soothing them, we nourish 'gainst our senate"
26281,Coriolanus,42,3.1.89,CORIOLANUS,"The cockle of rebellion, insolence, sedition,"
26282,Coriolanus,42,3.1.90,CORIOLANUS,"Which we ourselves have plough'd for, sow'd,"
26283,Coriolanus,42,3.1.91,CORIOLANUS,"and scatter'd,"
26284,Coriolanus,42,3.1.92,CORIOLANUS,"By mingling them with us, the honour'd number,"
26285,Coriolanus,42,3.1.93,CORIOLANUS,"Who lack not virtue, no, nor power, but that"
26286,Coriolanus,42,3.1.94,CORIOLANUS,Which they have given to beggars.
26287,Coriolanus,43,3.1.95,MENENIUS,"Well, no more."
26288,Coriolanus,44,3.1.96,First Senator,"No more words, we beseech you."
26289,Coriolanus,45,3.1.97,CORIOLANUS,How! no more!
26290,Coriolanus,45,3.1.98,CORIOLANUS,"As for my country I have shed my blood,"
26291,Coriolanus,45,3.1.99,CORIOLANUS,"Not fearing outward force, so shall my lungs"
26292,Coriolanus,45,3.1.100,CORIOLANUS,"Coin words till their decay against those measles,"
26293,Coriolanus,45,3.1.101,CORIOLANUS,"Which we disdain should tatter us, yet sought"
26294,Coriolanus,45,3.1.102,CORIOLANUS,The very way to catch them.
26295,Coriolanus,46,3.1.103,BRUTUS,"You speak o' the people,"
26296,Coriolanus,46,3.1.104,BRUTUS,"As if you were a god to punish, not"
26297,Coriolanus,46,3.1.105,BRUTUS,A man of their infirmity.
26298,Coriolanus,47,3.1.106,SICINIUS,'Twere well
26299,Coriolanus,47,3.1.107,SICINIUS,We let the people know't.
26300,Coriolanus,48,3.1.108,MENENIUS,"What, what? his choler?"
26301,Coriolanus,49,3.1.109,CORIOLANUS,Choler!
26302,Coriolanus,49,3.1.110,CORIOLANUS,"Were I as patient as the midnight sleep,"
26303,Coriolanus,49,3.1.111,CORIOLANUS,"By Jove, 'twould be my mind!"
26304,Coriolanus,50,3.1.112,SICINIUS,It is a mind
26305,Coriolanus,50,3.1.113,SICINIUS,"That shall remain a poison where it is,"
26306,Coriolanus,50,3.1.114,SICINIUS,Not poison any further.
26307,Coriolanus,51,3.1.115,CORIOLANUS,Shall remain!
26308,Coriolanus,51,3.1.116,CORIOLANUS,Hear you this Triton of the minnows? mark you
26309,Coriolanus,51,3.1.117,CORIOLANUS,His absolute 'shall'?
26310,Coriolanus,52,3.1.118,COMINIUS,'Twas from the canon.
26311,Coriolanus,53,3.1.119,CORIOLANUS,'Shall'!
26312,Coriolanus,53,3.1.120,CORIOLANUS,"O good but most unwise patricians! why,"
26313,Coriolanus,53,3.1.121,CORIOLANUS,"You grave but reckless senators, have you thus"
26314,Coriolanus,53,3.1.122,CORIOLANUS,"Given Hydra here to choose an officer,"
26315,Coriolanus,53,3.1.123,CORIOLANUS,"That with his peremptory 'shall,' being but"
26316,Coriolanus,53,3.1.124,CORIOLANUS,"The horn and noise o' the monster's, wants not spirit"
26317,Coriolanus,53,3.1.125,CORIOLANUS,"To say he'll turn your current in a ditch,"
26318,Coriolanus,53,3.1.126,CORIOLANUS,And make your channel his? If he have power
26319,Coriolanus,53,3.1.127,CORIOLANUS,"Then vail your ignorance, if none, awake"
26320,Coriolanus,53,3.1.128,CORIOLANUS,"Your dangerous lenity. If you are learn'd,"
26321,Coriolanus,53,3.1.129,CORIOLANUS,"Be not as common fools, if you are not,"
26322,Coriolanus,53,3.1.130,CORIOLANUS,"Let them have cushions by you. You are plebeians,"
26323,Coriolanus,53,3.1.131,CORIOLANUS,"If they be senators: and they are no less,"
26324,Coriolanus,53,3.1.132,CORIOLANUS,"When, both your voices blended, the great'st taste"
26325,Coriolanus,53,3.1.133,CORIOLANUS,"Most palates theirs. They choose their magistrate,"
26326,Coriolanus,53,3.1.134,CORIOLANUS,"And such a one as he, who puts his 'shall,'"
26327,Coriolanus,53,3.1.135,CORIOLANUS,His popular 'shall' against a graver bench
26328,Coriolanus,53,3.1.136,CORIOLANUS,Than ever frown in Greece. By Jove himself!
26329,Coriolanus,53,3.1.137,CORIOLANUS,It makes the consuls base: and my soul aches
26330,Coriolanus,53,3.1.138,CORIOLANUS,"To know, when two authorities are up,"
26331,Coriolanus,53,3.1.139,CORIOLANUS,"Neither supreme, how soon confusion"
26332,Coriolanus,53,3.1.140,CORIOLANUS,May enter 'twixt the gap of both and take
26333,Coriolanus,53,3.1.141,CORIOLANUS,The one by the other.
26334,Coriolanus,54,3.1.142,COMINIUS,"Well, on to the market-place."
26335,Coriolanus,55,3.1.143,CORIOLANUS,"Whoever gave that counsel, to give forth"
26336,Coriolanus,55,3.1.144,CORIOLANUS,"The corn o' the storehouse gratis, as 'twas used"
26337,Coriolanus,55,3.1.145,CORIOLANUS,"Sometime in Greece,--"
26338,Coriolanus,56,3.1.146,MENENIUS,"Well, well, no more of that."
26339,Coriolanus,57,3.1.147,CORIOLANUS,"Though there the people had more absolute power,"
26340,Coriolanus,57,3.1.148,CORIOLANUS,"I say, they nourish'd disobedience, fed"
26341,Coriolanus,57,3.1.149,CORIOLANUS,The ruin of the state.
26342,Coriolanus,58,3.1.150,BRUTUS,"Why, shall the people give"
26343,Coriolanus,58,3.1.151,BRUTUS,One that speaks thus their voice?
26344,Coriolanus,59,3.1.152,CORIOLANUS,"I'll give my reasons,"
26345,Coriolanus,59,3.1.153,CORIOLANUS,More worthier than their voices. They know the corn
26346,Coriolanus,59,3.1.154,CORIOLANUS,"Was not our recompense, resting well assured"
26347,Coriolanus,59,3.1.155,CORIOLANUS,"That ne'er did service for't: being press'd to the war,"
26348,Coriolanus,59,3.1.156,CORIOLANUS,"Even when the navel of the state was touch'd,"
26349,Coriolanus,59,3.1.157,CORIOLANUS,They would not thread the gates. This kind of service
26350,Coriolanus,59,3.1.158,CORIOLANUS,Did not deserve corn gratis. Being i' the war
26351,Coriolanus,59,3.1.159,CORIOLANUS,"Their mutinies and revolts, wherein they show'd"
26352,Coriolanus,59,3.1.160,CORIOLANUS,"Most valour, spoke not for them: the accusation"
26353,Coriolanus,59,3.1.161,CORIOLANUS,"Which they have often made against the senate,"
26354,Coriolanus,59,3.1.162,CORIOLANUS,"All cause unborn, could never be the motive"
26355,Coriolanus,59,3.1.163,CORIOLANUS,"Of our so frank donation. Well, what then?"
26356,Coriolanus,59,3.1.164,CORIOLANUS,How shall this bisson multitude digest
26357,Coriolanus,59,3.1.165,CORIOLANUS,The senate's courtesy? Let deeds express
26358,Coriolanus,59,3.1.166,CORIOLANUS,"What's like to be their words: 'we did request it,"
26359,Coriolanus,59,3.1.167,CORIOLANUS,"We are the greater poll, and in true fear"
26360,Coriolanus,59,3.1.168,CORIOLANUS,They gave us our demands.' Thus we debase
26361,Coriolanus,59,3.1.169,CORIOLANUS,The nature of our seats and make the rabble
26362,Coriolanus,59,3.1.170,CORIOLANUS,"Call our cares fears, which will in time"
26363,Coriolanus,59,3.1.171,CORIOLANUS,Break ope the locks o' the senate and bring in
26364,Coriolanus,59,3.1.172,CORIOLANUS,The crows to peck the eagles.
26365,Coriolanus,60,3.1.173,MENENIUS,"Come, enough."
26366,Coriolanus,61,3.1.174,BRUTUS,"Enough, with over-measure."
26367,Coriolanus,62,3.1.175,CORIOLANUS,"No, take more:"
26368,Coriolanus,62,3.1.176,CORIOLANUS,"What may be sworn by, both divine and human,"
26369,Coriolanus,62,3.1.177,CORIOLANUS,"Seal what I end withal! This double worship,"
26370,Coriolanus,62,3.1.178,CORIOLANUS,"Where one part does disdain with cause, the other"
26371,Coriolanus,62,3.1.179,CORIOLANUS,"Insult without all reason, where gentry, title, wisdom,"
26372,Coriolanus,62,3.1.180,CORIOLANUS,Cannot conclude but by the yea and no
26373,Coriolanus,62,3.1.181,CORIOLANUS,"Of general ignorance,--it must omit"
26374,Coriolanus,62,3.1.182,CORIOLANUS,"Real necessities, and give way the while"
26375,Coriolanus,62,3.1.183,CORIOLANUS,"To unstable slightness: purpose so barr'd,"

26377,Coriolanus,62,3.1.185,CORIOLANUS,"Nothing is done to purpose. Therefore, beseech you,--"
26378,Coriolanus,62,3.1.186,CORIOLANUS,"You that will be less fearful than discreet,"
26379,Coriolanus,62,3.1.187,CORIOLANUS,That love the fundamental part of state
26380,Coriolanus,62,3.1.188,CORIOLANUS,"More than you doubt the change on't, that prefer"
26381,Coriolanus,62,3.1.189,CORIOLANUS,"A noble life before a long, and wish"
26382,Coriolanus,62,3.1.190,CORIOLANUS,To jump a body with a dangerous physic
26383,Coriolanus,62,3.1.191,CORIOLANUS,"That's sure of death without it, at once pluck out"

26385,Coriolanus,62,3.1.193,CORIOLANUS,The sweet which is their poison: your dishonour
26386,Coriolanus,62,3.1.194,CORIOLANUS,Mangles true judgment and bereaves the state
26387,Coriolanus,62,3.1.195,CORIOLANUS,"Of that integrity which should become't,"
26388,Coriolanus,62,3.1.196,CORIOLANUS,"Not having the power to do the good it would,"
26389,Coriolanus,62,3.1.197,CORIOLANUS,For the in which doth control't.
26390,Coriolanus,63,3.1.198,BRUTUS,Has said enough.
26391,Coriolanus,64,3.1.199,SICINIUS,"Has spoken like a traitor, and shall answer"
26392,Coriolanus,64,3.1.200,SICINIUS,As traitors do.
26393,Coriolanus,65,3.1.201,CORIOLANUS,"Thou wretch, despite o'erwhelm thee!"
26394,Coriolanus,65,3.1.202,CORIOLANUS,What should the people do with these bald tribunes?
26395,Coriolanus,65,3.1.203,CORIOLANUS,"On whom depending, their obedience fails"
26396,Coriolanus,65,3.1.204,CORIOLANUS,"To the greater bench: in a rebellion,"
26397,Coriolanus,65,3.1.205,CORIOLANUS,"When what's not meet, but what must be, was law,"
26398,Coriolanus,65,3.1.206,CORIOLANUS,"Then were they chosen: in a better hour,"
26399,Coriolanus,65,3.1.207,CORIOLANUS,"Let what is meet be said it must be meet,"
26400,Coriolanus,65,3.1.208,CORIOLANUS,And throw their power i' the dust.
26401,Coriolanus,66,3.1.209,BRUTUS,Manifest treason!
26402,Coriolanus,67,3.1.210,SICINIUS,This a consul? no.
26403,Coriolanus,68,3.1.211,BRUTUS,"The aediles, ho!"
26404,Coriolanus,68,,BRUTUS,Enter an AEdile
26405,Coriolanus,68,3.1.212,BRUTUS,Let him be apprehended.
26406,Coriolanus,69,3.1.213,SICINIUS,"Go, call the people:"
26407,Coriolanus,69,,SICINIUS,Exit AEdile
26408,Coriolanus,69,3.1.214,SICINIUS,in whose name myself
26409,Coriolanus,69,3.1.215,SICINIUS,"Attach thee as a traitorous innovator,"
26410,Coriolanus,69,3.1.216,SICINIUS,"A foe to the public weal: obey, I charge thee,"
26411,Coriolanus,69,3.1.217,SICINIUS,And follow to thine answer.
26412,Coriolanus,70,3.1.218,CORIOLANUS,"Hence, old goat!"
26413,Coriolanus,70,3.1.219,CORIOLANUS,"Senators,  and C	We'll surety him."
26414,Coriolanus,71,3.1.220,COMINIUS,"Aged sir, hands off."
26415,Coriolanus,72,3.1.221,CORIOLANUS,"Hence, rotten thing! or I shall shake thy bones"
26416,Coriolanus,72,3.1.222,CORIOLANUS,Out of thy garments.
26417,Coriolanus,73,3.1.223,SICINIUS,"Help, ye citizens!"
26418,Coriolanus,73,3.1.223,SICINIUS,"Enter a rabble of Citizens (Plebeians), with the AEdiles"
26419,Coriolanus,74,3.1.224,MENENIUS,On both sides more respect.
26420,Coriolanus,75,3.1.225,SICINIUS,Here's he that would take from you all your power.
26421,Coriolanus,76,3.1.226,BRUTUS,"Seize him, AEdiles!"
26422,Coriolanus,77,3.1.227,Citizens,Down with him! down with him!
26423,Coriolanus,77,3.1.228,Citizens,"Senators,  and C	Weapons, weapons, weapons!"
26424,Coriolanus,77,,Citizens,"They all bustle about CORIOLANUS, crying"
26425,Coriolanus,77,3.1.229,Citizens,"'Tribunes!' 'Patricians!' 'Citizens!' 'What, ho!'"
26426,Coriolanus,77,3.1.230,Citizens,'Sicinius!' 'Brutus!' 'Coriolanus!' 'Citizens!'
26427,Coriolanus,77,3.1.231,Citizens,"'Peace, peace, peace!' 'Stay, hold, peace!'"
26428,Coriolanus,78,3.1.232,MENENIUS,"What is about to be? I am out of breath,"
26429,Coriolanus,78,3.1.233,MENENIUS,"Confusion's near, I cannot speak. You, tribunes"
26430,Coriolanus,78,3.1.234,MENENIUS,"To the people! Coriolanus, patience!"
26431,Coriolanus,78,3.1.235,MENENIUS,"Speak, good Sicinius."
26432,Coriolanus,79,3.1.236,SICINIUS,"Hear me, people, peace!"
26433,Coriolanus,80,3.1.237,Citizens,"Let's hear our tribune: peace Speak, speak, speak."
26434,Coriolanus,81,3.1.238,SICINIUS,You are at point to lose your liberties:
26435,Coriolanus,81,3.1.239,SICINIUS,"Marcius would have all from you, Marcius,"
26436,Coriolanus,81,3.1.240,SICINIUS,Whom late you have named for consul.
26437,Coriolanus,82,3.1.241,MENENIUS,"Fie, fie, fie!"
26438,Coriolanus,82,3.1.242,MENENIUS,"This is the way to kindle, not to quench."
26439,Coriolanus,83,3.1.243,First Senator,To unbuild the city and to lay all flat.
26440,Coriolanus,84,3.1.244,SICINIUS,What is the city but the people?
26441,Coriolanus,85,3.1.245,Citizens,"True,"
26442,Coriolanus,85,3.1.246,Citizens,The people are the city.
26443,Coriolanus,86,3.1.247,BRUTUS,"By the consent of all, we were establish'd"
26444,Coriolanus,86,3.1.248,BRUTUS,The people's magistrates.
26445,Coriolanus,87,3.1.249,Citizens,You so remain.
26446,Coriolanus,88,3.1.250,MENENIUS,And so are like to do.
26447,Coriolanus,89,3.1.251,COMINIUS,"That is the way to lay the city flat,"
26448,Coriolanus,89,3.1.252,COMINIUS,"To bring the roof to the foundation,"
26449,Coriolanus,89,3.1.253,COMINIUS,"And bury all, which yet distinctly ranges,"
26450,Coriolanus,89,3.1.254,COMINIUS,In heaps and piles of ruin.
26451,Coriolanus,90,3.1.255,SICINIUS,This deserves death.
26452,Coriolanus,91,3.1.256,BRUTUS,"Or let us stand to our authority,"
26453,Coriolanus,91,3.1.257,BRUTUS,"Or let us lose it. We do here pronounce,"
26454,Coriolanus,91,3.1.258,BRUTUS,"Upon the part o' the people, in whose power"
26455,Coriolanus,91,3.1.259,BRUTUS,"We were elected theirs, Marcius is worthy"
26456,Coriolanus,91,3.1.260,BRUTUS,Of present death.
26457,Coriolanus,92,3.1.261,SICINIUS,"Therefore lay hold of him,"
26458,Coriolanus,92,3.1.262,SICINIUS,"Bear him to the rock Tarpeian, and from thence"
26459,Coriolanus,92,3.1.263,SICINIUS,Into destruction cast him.
26460,Coriolanus,93,3.1.264,BRUTUS,"AEdiles, seize him!"
26461,Coriolanus,94,3.1.265,Citizens,"Yield, Marcius, yield!"
26462,Coriolanus,95,3.1.266,MENENIUS,"Hear me one word,"
26463,Coriolanus,95,3.1.267,MENENIUS,"Beseech you, tribunes, hear me but a word."
26464,Coriolanus,96,3.1.268,AEdile,"Peace, peace!"
26465,Coriolanus,97,3.1.269,MENENIUS,"[To BRUTUS]  Be that you seem, truly your"
26466,Coriolanus,97,3.1.270,MENENIUS,"country's friend,"
26467,Coriolanus,97,3.1.271,MENENIUS,And temperately proceed to what you would
26468,Coriolanus,97,3.1.272,MENENIUS,Thus violently redress.
26469,Coriolanus,98,3.1.273,BRUTUS,"Sir, those cold ways,"
26470,Coriolanus,98,3.1.274,BRUTUS,"That seem like prudent helps, are very poisonous"
26471,Coriolanus,98,3.1.275,BRUTUS,"Where the disease is violent. Lay hands upon him,"
26472,Coriolanus,98,3.1.276,BRUTUS,And bear him to the rock.
26473,Coriolanus,99,3.1.277,CORIOLANUS,"No, I'll die here."
26474,Coriolanus,99,,CORIOLANUS,Drawing his sword
26475,Coriolanus,99,3.1.278,CORIOLANUS,There's some among you have beheld me fighting:
26476,Coriolanus,99,3.1.279,CORIOLANUS,"Come, try upon yourselves what you have seen me."
26477,Coriolanus,100,3.1.280,MENENIUS,"Down with that sword! Tribunes, withdraw awhile."
26478,Coriolanus,101,3.1.281,BRUTUS,Lay hands upon him.
26479,Coriolanus,102,3.1.282,COMINIUS,"Help Marcius, help,"
26480,Coriolanus,102,3.1.283,COMINIUS,"You that be noble, help him, young and old!"
26481,Coriolanus,103,3.1.284,Citizens,"Down with him, down with him!"
26482,Coriolanus,103,,Citizens,"In this mutiny, the Tribunes, the AEdiles, and the People, are beat in"
26483,Coriolanus,104,3.1.285,MENENIUS,"Go, get you to your house, be gone, away!"
26484,Coriolanus,104,3.1.286,MENENIUS,All will be naught else.
26485,Coriolanus,105,3.1.287,Second Senator,Get you gone.
26486,Coriolanus,106,3.1.288,COMINIUS,"Stand fast,"
26487,Coriolanus,106,3.1.289,COMINIUS,We have as many friends as enemies.
26488,Coriolanus,107,3.1.290,MENENIUS,Sham it be put to that?
26489,Coriolanus,108,3.1.291,First Senator,The gods forbid!
26490,Coriolanus,108,3.1.292,First Senator,"I prithee, noble friend, home to thy house,"
26491,Coriolanus,108,3.1.293,First Senator,Leave us to cure this cause.
26492,Coriolanus,109,3.1.294,MENENIUS,"For 'tis a sore upon us,"
26493,Coriolanus,109,3.1.295,MENENIUS,"You cannot tent yourself: be gone, beseech you."
26494,Coriolanus,110,3.1.296,COMINIUS,"Come, sir, along with us."
26495,Coriolanus,111,3.1.297,CORIOLANUS,"I would they were barbarians--as they are,"
26496,Coriolanus,111,3.1.298,CORIOLANUS,"Though in Rome litter'd--not Romans--as they are not,"
26497,Coriolanus,111,3.1.299,CORIOLANUS,Though calved i' the porch o' the Capitol--
26498,Coriolanus,112,3.1.300,MENENIUS,"Be gone,"
26499,Coriolanus,112,3.1.301,MENENIUS,"Put not your worthy rage into your tongue,"
26500,Coriolanus,112,3.1.302,MENENIUS,One time will owe another.
26501,Coriolanus,113,3.1.303,CORIOLANUS,On fair ground
26502,Coriolanus,113,3.1.304,CORIOLANUS,I could beat forty of them.
26503,Coriolanus,114,3.1.305,COMINIUS,I could myself
26504,Coriolanus,114,3.1.306,COMINIUS,"Take up a brace o' the best of them, yea, the"

26506,Coriolanus,114,3.1.308,COMINIUS,"But now 'tis odds beyond arithmetic,"
26507,Coriolanus,114,3.1.309,COMINIUS,"And manhood is call'd foolery, when it stands"
26508,Coriolanus,114,3.1.310,COMINIUS,"Against a falling fabric. Will you hence,"
26509,Coriolanus,114,3.1.311,COMINIUS,Before the tag return? whose rage doth rend
26510,Coriolanus,114,3.1.312,COMINIUS,Like interrupted waters and o'erbear
26511,Coriolanus,114,3.1.313,COMINIUS,What they are used to bear.
26512,Coriolanus,115,3.1.314,MENENIUS,"Pray you, be gone:"
26513,Coriolanus,115,3.1.315,MENENIUS,I'll try whether my old wit be in request
26514,Coriolanus,115,3.1.316,MENENIUS,With those that have but little: this must be patch'd
26515,Coriolanus,115,3.1.317,MENENIUS,With cloth of any colour.
26516,Coriolanus,116,3.1.318,COMINIUS,"Nay, come away."
26517,Coriolanus,116,,COMINIUS,"Exeunt CORIOLANUS, COMINIUS, and others"

26519,Coriolanus,118,3.1.320,MENENIUS,His nature is too noble for the world:
26520,Coriolanus,118,3.1.321,MENENIUS,"He would not flatter Neptune for his trident,"
26521,Coriolanus,118,3.1.322,MENENIUS,Or Jove for's power to thunder. His heart's his mouth:
26522,Coriolanus,118,3.1.323,MENENIUS,"What his breast forges, that his tongue must vent,"
26523,Coriolanus,118,3.1.324,MENENIUS,"And, being angry, does forget that ever"
26524,Coriolanus,118,3.1.325,MENENIUS,He heard the name of death.
26525,Coriolanus,118,,MENENIUS,A noise within
26526,Coriolanus,118,3.1.326,MENENIUS,Here's goodly work!
26527,Coriolanus,119,3.1.327,Second Patrician,I would they were abed!
26528,Coriolanus,120,3.1.328,MENENIUS,I would they were in Tiber! What the vengeance!
26529,Coriolanus,120,3.1.329,MENENIUS,Could he not speak 'em fair?
26530,Coriolanus,120,,MENENIUS,"Re-enter BRUTUS and SICINIUS, with the rabble"
26531,Coriolanus,121,3.1.330,SICINIUS,Where is this viper

26533,Coriolanus,121,3.1.332,SICINIUS,Be every man himself?
26534,Coriolanus,122,3.1.333,MENENIUS,"You worthy tribunes,--"
26535,Coriolanus,123,3.1.334,SICINIUS,He shall be thrown down the Tarpeian rock
26536,Coriolanus,123,3.1.335,SICINIUS,"With rigorous hands: he hath resisted law,"
26537,Coriolanus,123,3.1.336,SICINIUS,And therefore law shall scorn him further trial
26538,Coriolanus,123,3.1.337,SICINIUS,Than the severity of the public power
26539,Coriolanus,123,3.1.338,SICINIUS,Which he so sets at nought.
26540,Coriolanus,124,3.1.339,First Citizen,He shall well know
26541,Coriolanus,124,3.1.340,First Citizen,"The noble tribunes are the people's mouths,"
26542,Coriolanus,124,3.1.341,First Citizen,And we their hands.
26543,Coriolanus,125,3.1.342,Citizens,"He shall, sure on't."
26544,Coriolanus,126,3.1.343,MENENIUS,"Sir, sir,--"
26545,Coriolanus,127,3.1.344,SICINIUS,Peace!
26546,Coriolanus,128,3.1.345,MENENIUS,"Do not cry havoc, where you should but hunt"
26547,Coriolanus,128,3.1.346,MENENIUS,With modest warrant.
26548,Coriolanus,129,3.1.347,SICINIUS,"Sir, how comes't that you"
26549,Coriolanus,129,3.1.348,SICINIUS,Have holp to make this rescue?
26550,Coriolanus,130,3.1.349,MENENIUS,Hear me speak:
26551,Coriolanus,130,3.1.350,MENENIUS,"As I do know the consul's worthiness,"
26552,Coriolanus,130,3.1.351,MENENIUS,"So can I name his faults,--"
26553,Coriolanus,131,3.1.352,SICINIUS,Consul! what consul?
26554,Coriolanus,132,3.1.353,MENENIUS,The consul Coriolanus.
26555,Coriolanus,133,3.1.354,BRUTUS,He consul!
26556,Coriolanus,134,3.1.355,Citizens,"No, no, no, no, no."
26557,Coriolanus,135,3.1.356,MENENIUS,"If, by the tribunes' leave, and yours, good people,"
26558,Coriolanus,135,3.1.357,MENENIUS,"I may be heard, I would crave a word or two,"
26559,Coriolanus,135,3.1.358,MENENIUS,The which shall turn you to no further harm
26560,Coriolanus,135,3.1.359,MENENIUS,Than so much loss of time.
26561,Coriolanus,136,3.1.360,SICINIUS,"Speak briefly then,"
26562,Coriolanus,136,3.1.361,SICINIUS,For we are peremptory to dispatch
26563,Coriolanus,136,3.1.362,SICINIUS,This viperous traitor: to eject him hence
26564,Coriolanus,136,3.1.363,SICINIUS,"Were but one danger, and to keep him here"
26565,Coriolanus,136,3.1.364,SICINIUS,Our certain death: therefore it is decreed
26566,Coriolanus,136,3.1.365,SICINIUS,He dies to-night.
26567,Coriolanus,137,3.1.366,MENENIUS,Now the good gods forbid
26568,Coriolanus,137,3.1.367,MENENIUS,"That our renowned Rome, whose gratitude"
26569,Coriolanus,137,3.1.368,MENENIUS,Towards her deserved children is enroll'd
26570,Coriolanus,137,3.1.369,MENENIUS,"In Jove's own book, like an unnatural dam"
26571,Coriolanus,137,3.1.370,MENENIUS,Should now eat up her own!
26572,Coriolanus,138,3.1.371,SICINIUS,He's a disease that must be cut away.
26573,Coriolanus,139,3.1.372,MENENIUS,"O, he's a limb that has but a disease,"
26574,Coriolanus,139,3.1.373,MENENIUS,"Mortal, to cut it off, to cure it, easy."
26575,Coriolanus,139,3.1.374,MENENIUS,What has he done to Rome that's worthy death?
26576,Coriolanus,139,3.1.375,MENENIUS,"Killing our enemies, the blood he hath lost--"
26577,Coriolanus,139,3.1.376,MENENIUS,"Which, I dare vouch, is more than that he hath,"
26578,Coriolanus,139,3.1.377,MENENIUS,"By many an ounce--he dropp'd it for his country,"
26579,Coriolanus,139,3.1.378,MENENIUS,"And what is left, to lose it by his country,"
26580,Coriolanus,139,3.1.379,MENENIUS,"Were to us all, that do't and suffer it,"
26581,Coriolanus,139,3.1.380,MENENIUS,A brand to the end o' the world.
26582,Coriolanus,140,3.1.381,SICINIUS,This is clean kam.
26583,Coriolanus,141,3.1.382,BRUTUS,"Merely awry: when he did love his country,"
26584,Coriolanus,141,3.1.383,BRUTUS,It honour'd him.
26585,Coriolanus,142,3.1.384,MENENIUS,The service of the foot
26586,Coriolanus,142,3.1.385,MENENIUS,"Being once gangrened, is not then respected"
26587,Coriolanus,142,3.1.386,MENENIUS,For what before it was.
26588,Coriolanus,143,3.1.387,BRUTUS,We'll hear no more.
26589,Coriolanus,143,3.1.388,BRUTUS,"Pursue him to his house, and pluck him thence:"
26590,Coriolanus,143,3.1.389,BRUTUS,"Lest his infection, being of catching nature,"
26591,Coriolanus,143,3.1.390,BRUTUS,Spread further.
26592,Coriolanus,144,3.1.391,MENENIUS,"One word more, one word."
26593,Coriolanus,144,3.1.392,MENENIUS,"This tiger-footed rage, when it shall find"
26594,Coriolanus,144,3.1.393,MENENIUS,"The harm of unscann'd swiftness, will too late"
26595,Coriolanus,144,3.1.394,MENENIUS,"Tie leaden pounds to's heels. Proceed by process,"
26596,Coriolanus,144,3.1.395,MENENIUS,"Lest parties, as he is beloved, break out,"
26597,Coriolanus,144,3.1.396,MENENIUS,And sack great Rome with Romans.
26598,Coriolanus,145,3.1.397,BRUTUS,"If it were so,--"
26599,Coriolanus,146,3.1.398,SICINIUS,What do ye talk?
26600,Coriolanus,146,3.1.399,SICINIUS,Have we not had a taste of his obedience?
26601,Coriolanus,146,3.1.400,SICINIUS,Our aediles smote? ourselves resisted? Come.
26602,Coriolanus,147,3.1.401,MENENIUS,Consider this: he has been bred i' the wars
26603,Coriolanus,147,3.1.402,MENENIUS,"Since he could draw a sword, and is ill school'd"
26604,Coriolanus,147,3.1.403,MENENIUS,"In bolted language, meal and bran together"
26605,Coriolanus,147,3.1.404,MENENIUS,"He throws without distinction. Give me leave,"
26606,Coriolanus,147,3.1.405,MENENIUS,"I'll go to him, and undertake to bring him"
26607,Coriolanus,147,3.1.406,MENENIUS,"Where he shall answer, by a lawful form,"
26608,Coriolanus,147,3.1.407,MENENIUS,"In peace, to his utmost peril."
26609,Coriolanus,148,3.1.408,First Senator,"Noble tribunes,"
26610,Coriolanus,148,3.1.409,First Senator,It is the humane way: the other course
26611,Coriolanus,148,3.1.410,First Senator,"Will prove too bloody, and the end of it"
26612,Coriolanus,148,3.1.411,First Senator,Unknown to the beginning.
26613,Coriolanus,149,3.1.412,SICINIUS,"Noble Menenius,"
26614,Coriolanus,149,3.1.413,SICINIUS,Be you then as the people's officer.
26615,Coriolanus,149,3.1.414,SICINIUS,"Masters, lay down your weapons."
26616,Coriolanus,150,3.1.415,BRUTUS,Go not home.
26617,Coriolanus,151,3.1.416,SICINIUS,Meet on the market-place. We'll attend you there:
26618,Coriolanus,151,3.1.417,SICINIUS,"Where, if you bring not Marcius, we'll proceed"
26619,Coriolanus,151,3.1.418,SICINIUS,In our first way.
26620,Coriolanus,152,3.1.419,MENENIUS,I'll bring him to you.
26621,Coriolanus,152,,MENENIUS,To the Senators
26622,Coriolanus,152,3.1.420,MENENIUS,"Let me desire your company: he must come,"
26623,Coriolanus,152,3.1.421,MENENIUS,Or what is worst will follow.
26624,Coriolanus,153,3.1.422,First Senator,"Pray you, let's to him."
26625,Coriolanus,153,,First Senator,Exeunt
26626,Coriolanus,153,,First Senator,SCENE II. A room in CORIOLANUS'S house.
26627,Coriolanus,153,,First Senator,Enter CORIOLANUS with Patricians
26628,Coriolanus,1,3.2.1,CORIOLANUS,"Let them puff all about mine ears, present me"
26629,Coriolanus,1,3.2.2,CORIOLANUS,"Death on the wheel or at wild horses' heels,"
26630,Coriolanus,1,3.2.3,CORIOLANUS,"Or pile ten hills on the Tarpeian rock,"
26631,Coriolanus,1,3.2.4,CORIOLANUS,That the precipitation might down stretch
26632,Coriolanus,1,3.2.5,CORIOLANUS,"Below the beam of sight, yet will I still"
26633,Coriolanus,1,3.2.6,CORIOLANUS,Be thus to them.
26634,Coriolanus,2,3.2.7,A Patrician,You do the nobler.
26635,Coriolanus,3,3.2.8,CORIOLANUS,I muse my mother
26636,Coriolanus,3,3.2.9,CORIOLANUS,"Does not approve me further, who was wont"
26637,Coriolanus,3,3.2.10,CORIOLANUS,"To call them woollen vassals, things created"
26638,Coriolanus,3,3.2.11,CORIOLANUS,"To buy and sell with groats, to show bare heads"
26639,Coriolanus,3,3.2.12,CORIOLANUS,"In congregations, to yawn, be still and wonder,"
26640,Coriolanus,3,3.2.13,CORIOLANUS,When one but of my ordinance stood up
26641,Coriolanus,3,3.2.14,CORIOLANUS,To speak of peace or war.
26642,Coriolanus,3,,CORIOLANUS,Enter VOLUMNIA
26643,Coriolanus,3,3.2.15,CORIOLANUS,I talk of you:
26644,Coriolanus,3,3.2.16,CORIOLANUS,Why did you wish me milder? would you have me
26645,Coriolanus,3,3.2.17,CORIOLANUS,False to my nature? Rather say I play
26646,Coriolanus,3,3.2.18,CORIOLANUS,The man I am.
26647,Coriolanus,4,3.2.19,VOLUMNIA,"O, sir, sir, sir,"
26648,Coriolanus,4,3.2.20,VOLUMNIA,"I would have had you put your power well on,"
26649,Coriolanus,4,3.2.21,VOLUMNIA,Before you had worn it out.
26650,Coriolanus,5,3.2.22,CORIOLANUS,Let go.
26651,Coriolanus,6,3.2.23,VOLUMNIA,"You might have been enough the man you are,"
26652,Coriolanus,6,3.2.24,VOLUMNIA,"With striving less to be so, lesser had been"
26653,Coriolanus,6,3.2.25,VOLUMNIA,"The thwartings of your dispositions, if"
26654,Coriolanus,6,3.2.26,VOLUMNIA,You had not show'd them how ye were disposed
26655,Coriolanus,6,3.2.27,VOLUMNIA,Ere they lack'd power to cross you.
26656,Coriolanus,7,3.2.28,CORIOLANUS,Let them hang.
26657,Coriolanus,8,3.2.29,A Patrician,"Ay, and burn too."
26658,Coriolanus,8,,A Patrician,Enter MENENIUS and Senators
26659,Coriolanus,9,3.2.30,MENENIUS,"Come, come, you have been too rough, something"
26660,Coriolanus,9,3.2.31,MENENIUS,"too rough,"
26661,Coriolanus,9,3.2.32,MENENIUS,You must return and mend it.
26662,Coriolanus,10,3.2.33,First Senator,"There's no remedy,"
26663,Coriolanus,10,3.2.34,First Senator,"Unless, by not so doing, our good city"
26664,Coriolanus,10,3.2.35,First Senator,"Cleave in the midst, and perish."
26665,Coriolanus,11,3.2.36,VOLUMNIA,"Pray, be counsell'd:"
26666,Coriolanus,11,3.2.37,VOLUMNIA,"I have a heart as little apt as yours,"
26667,Coriolanus,11,3.2.38,VOLUMNIA,But yet a brain that leads my use of anger
26668,Coriolanus,11,3.2.39,VOLUMNIA,To better vantage.
26669,Coriolanus,12,3.2.40,MENENIUS,"Well said, noble woman?"
26670,Coriolanus,12,3.2.41,MENENIUS,"Before he should thus stoop to the herd, but that"
26671,Coriolanus,12,3.2.42,MENENIUS,The violent fit o' the time craves it as physic
26672,Coriolanus,12,3.2.43,MENENIUS,"For the whole state, I would put mine armour on,"
26673,Coriolanus,12,3.2.44,MENENIUS,Which I can scarcely bear.
26674,Coriolanus,13,3.2.45,CORIOLANUS,What must I do?
26675,Coriolanus,14,3.2.46,MENENIUS,Return to the tribunes.
26676,Coriolanus,15,3.2.47,CORIOLANUS,"Well, what then? what then?"
26677,Coriolanus,16,3.2.48,MENENIUS,Repent what you have spoke.
26678,Coriolanus,17,3.2.49,CORIOLANUS,"For them! I cannot do it to the gods,"
26679,Coriolanus,17,3.2.50,CORIOLANUS,Must I then do't to them?
26680,Coriolanus,18,3.2.51,VOLUMNIA,"You are too absolute,"
26681,Coriolanus,18,3.2.52,VOLUMNIA,"Though therein you can never be too noble,"
26682,Coriolanus,18,3.2.53,VOLUMNIA,"But when extremities speak. I have heard you say,"
26683,Coriolanus,18,3.2.54,VOLUMNIA,"Honour and policy, like unsever'd friends,"
26684,Coriolanus,18,3.2.55,VOLUMNIA,"I' the war do grow together: grant that, and tell me,"
26685,Coriolanus,18,3.2.56,VOLUMNIA,"In peace what each of them by the other lose,"
26686,Coriolanus,18,3.2.57,VOLUMNIA,That they combine not there.
26687,Coriolanus,19,3.2.58,CORIOLANUS,"Tush, tush!"
26688,Coriolanus,20,3.2.59,MENENIUS,A good demand.
26689,Coriolanus,21,3.2.60,VOLUMNIA,If it be honour in your wars to seem
26690,Coriolanus,21,3.2.61,VOLUMNIA,"The same you are not, which, for your best ends,"
26691,Coriolanus,21,3.2.62,VOLUMNIA,"You adopt your policy, how is it less or worse,"
26692,Coriolanus,21,3.2.63,VOLUMNIA,That it shall hold companionship in peace
26693,Coriolanus,21,3.2.64,VOLUMNIA,"With honour, as in war, since that to both"
26694,Coriolanus,21,3.2.65,VOLUMNIA,It stands in like request?
26695,Coriolanus,22,3.2.66,CORIOLANUS,Why force you this?
26696,Coriolanus,23,3.2.67,VOLUMNIA,Because that now it lies you on to speak
26697,Coriolanus,23,3.2.68,VOLUMNIA,"To the people, not by your own instruction,"
26698,Coriolanus,23,3.2.69,VOLUMNIA,"Nor by the matter which your heart prompts you,"
26699,Coriolanus,23,3.2.70,VOLUMNIA,But with such words that are but rooted in
26700,Coriolanus,23,3.2.71,VOLUMNIA,"Your tongue, though but bastards and syllables"
26701,Coriolanus,23,3.2.72,VOLUMNIA,Of no allowance to your bosom's truth.
26702,Coriolanus,23,3.2.73,VOLUMNIA,"Now, this no more dishonours you at all"
26703,Coriolanus,23,3.2.74,VOLUMNIA,"Than to take in a town with gentle words,"
26704,Coriolanus,23,3.2.75,VOLUMNIA,Which else would put you to your fortune and
26705,Coriolanus,23,3.2.76,VOLUMNIA,The hazard of much blood.
26706,Coriolanus,23,3.2.77,VOLUMNIA,I would dissemble with my nature where
26707,Coriolanus,23,3.2.78,VOLUMNIA,My fortunes and my friends at stake required
26708,Coriolanus,23,3.2.79,VOLUMNIA,"I should do so in honour: I am in this,"
26709,Coriolanus,23,3.2.80,VOLUMNIA,"Your wife, your son, these senators, the nobles,"
26710,Coriolanus,23,3.2.81,VOLUMNIA,And you will rather show our general louts
26711,Coriolanus,23,3.2.82,VOLUMNIA,"How you can frown than spend a fawn upon 'em,"
26712,Coriolanus,23,3.2.83,VOLUMNIA,For the inheritance of their loves and safeguard
26713,Coriolanus,23,3.2.84,VOLUMNIA,Of what that want might ruin.
26714,Coriolanus,24,3.2.85,MENENIUS,Noble lady!
26715,Coriolanus,24,3.2.86,MENENIUS,"Come, go with us, speak fair: you may salve so,"
26716,Coriolanus,24,3.2.87,MENENIUS,"Not what is dangerous present, but the loss"
26717,Coriolanus,24,3.2.88,MENENIUS,Of what is past.
26718,Coriolanus,25,3.2.89,VOLUMNIA,"I prithee now, my son,"
26719,Coriolanus,25,3.2.90,VOLUMNIA,"Go to them, with this bonnet in thy hand,"
26720,Coriolanus,25,3.2.91,VOLUMNIA,And thus far having stretch'd it--here be with them--
26721,Coriolanus,25,3.2.92,VOLUMNIA,Thy knee bussing the stones--for in such business
26722,Coriolanus,25,3.2.93,VOLUMNIA,"Action is eloquence, and the eyes of the ignorant"
26723,Coriolanus,25,3.2.94,VOLUMNIA,"More learned than the ears--waving thy head,"
26724,Coriolanus,25,3.2.95,VOLUMNIA,"Which often, thus, correcting thy stout heart,"
26725,Coriolanus,25,3.2.96,VOLUMNIA,Now humble as the ripest mulberry
26726,Coriolanus,25,3.2.97,VOLUMNIA,"That will not hold the handling: or say to them,"
26727,Coriolanus,25,3.2.98,VOLUMNIA,"Thou art their soldier, and being bred in broils"
26728,Coriolanus,25,3.2.99,VOLUMNIA,"Hast not the soft way which, thou dost confess,"
26729,Coriolanus,25,3.2.100,VOLUMNIA,"Were fit for thee to use as they to claim,"
26730,Coriolanus,25,3.2.101,VOLUMNIA,"In asking their good loves, but thou wilt frame"
26731,Coriolanus,25,3.2.102,VOLUMNIA,"Thyself, forsooth, hereafter theirs, so far"
26732,Coriolanus,25,3.2.103,VOLUMNIA,As thou hast power and person.
26733,Coriolanus,26,3.2.104,MENENIUS,"This but done,"
26734,Coriolanus,26,3.2.105,MENENIUS,"Even as she speaks, why, their hearts were yours,"
26735,Coriolanus,26,3.2.106,MENENIUS,"For they have pardons, being ask'd, as free"
26736,Coriolanus,26,3.2.107,MENENIUS,As words to little purpose.
26737,Coriolanus,27,3.2.108,VOLUMNIA,"Prithee now,"
26738,Coriolanus,27,3.2.109,VOLUMNIA,"Go, and be ruled: although I know thou hadst rather"
26739,Coriolanus,27,3.2.110,VOLUMNIA,Follow thine enemy in a fiery gulf
26740,Coriolanus,27,3.2.111,VOLUMNIA,Than flatter him in a bower. Here is Cominius.
26741,Coriolanus,27,,VOLUMNIA,Enter COMINIUS
26742,Coriolanus,28,3.2.112,COMINIUS,"I have been i' the market-place, and, sir,'tis fit"
26743,Coriolanus,28,3.2.113,COMINIUS,"You make strong party, or defend yourself"
26744,Coriolanus,28,3.2.114,COMINIUS,By calmness or by absence: all's in anger.
26745,Coriolanus,29,3.2.115,MENENIUS,Only fair speech.
26746,Coriolanus,30,3.2.116,COMINIUS,"I think 'twill serve, if he"
26747,Coriolanus,30,3.2.117,COMINIUS,Can thereto frame his spirit.
26748,Coriolanus,31,3.2.118,VOLUMNIA,"He must, and will"
26749,Coriolanus,31,3.2.119,VOLUMNIA,"Prithee now, say you will, and go about it."
26750,Coriolanus,32,3.2.120,CORIOLANUS,Must I go show them my unbarbed sconce?
26751,Coriolanus,32,3.2.121,CORIOLANUS,Must I with base tongue give my noble heart
26752,Coriolanus,32,3.2.122,CORIOLANUS,"A lie that it must bear? Well, I will do't:"
26753,Coriolanus,32,3.2.123,CORIOLANUS,"Yet, were there but this single plot to lose,"
26754,Coriolanus,32,3.2.124,CORIOLANUS,"This mould of Marcius, they to dust should grind it"
26755,Coriolanus,32,3.2.125,CORIOLANUS,And throw't against the wind. To the market-place!
26756,Coriolanus,32,3.2.126,CORIOLANUS,You have put me now to such a part which never
26757,Coriolanus,32,3.2.127,CORIOLANUS,I shall discharge to the life.
26758,Coriolanus,33,3.2.128,COMINIUS,"Come, come, we'll prompt you."
26759,Coriolanus,34,3.2.129,VOLUMNIA,"I prithee now, sweet son, as thou hast said"
26760,Coriolanus,34,3.2.130,VOLUMNIA,"My praises made thee first a soldier, so,"
26761,Coriolanus,34,3.2.131,VOLUMNIA,"To have my praise for this, perform a part"
26762,Coriolanus,34,3.2.132,VOLUMNIA,Thou hast not done before.
26763,Coriolanus,35,3.2.133,CORIOLANUS,"Well, I must do't:"
26764,Coriolanus,35,3.2.134,CORIOLANUS,"Away, my disposition, and possess me"
26765,Coriolanus,35,3.2.135,CORIOLANUS,"Some harlot's spirit! my throat of war be turn'd,"
26766,Coriolanus,35,3.2.136,CORIOLANUS,"Which quired with my drum, into a pipe"
26767,Coriolanus,35,3.2.137,CORIOLANUS,"Small as an eunuch, or the virgin voice"
26768,Coriolanus,35,3.2.138,CORIOLANUS,That babies lulls asleep! the smiles of knaves
26769,Coriolanus,35,3.2.139,CORIOLANUS,"Tent in my cheeks, and schoolboys' tears take up"
26770,Coriolanus,35,3.2.140,CORIOLANUS,The glasses of my sight! a beggar's tongue
26771,Coriolanus,35,3.2.141,CORIOLANUS,"Make motion through my lips, and my arm'd knees,"
26772,Coriolanus,35,3.2.142,CORIOLANUS,"Who bow'd but in my stirrup, bend like his"
26773,Coriolanus,35,3.2.143,CORIOLANUS,"That hath received an alms! I will not do't,"
26774,Coriolanus,35,3.2.144,CORIOLANUS,Lest I surcease to honour mine own truth
26775,Coriolanus,35,3.2.145,CORIOLANUS,And by my body's action teach my mind
26776,Coriolanus,35,3.2.146,CORIOLANUS,A most inherent baseness.
26777,Coriolanus,36,3.2.147,VOLUMNIA,"At thy choice, then:"
26778,Coriolanus,36,3.2.148,VOLUMNIA,"To beg of thee, it is my more dishonour"
26779,Coriolanus,36,3.2.149,VOLUMNIA,"Than thou of them. Come all to ruin, let"
26780,Coriolanus,36,3.2.150,VOLUMNIA,Thy mother rather feel thy pride than fear
26781,Coriolanus,36,3.2.151,VOLUMNIA,"Thy dangerous stoutness, for I mock at death"
26782,Coriolanus,36,3.2.152,VOLUMNIA,With as big heart as thou. Do as thou list
26783,Coriolanus,36,3.2.153,VOLUMNIA,"Thy valiantness was mine, thou suck'dst it from me,"
26784,Coriolanus,36,3.2.154,VOLUMNIA,But owe thy pride thyself.
26785,Coriolanus,37,3.2.155,CORIOLANUS,"Pray, be content:"
26786,Coriolanus,37,3.2.156,CORIOLANUS,"Mother, I am going to the market-place,"
26787,Coriolanus,37,3.2.157,CORIOLANUS,"Chide me no more. I'll mountebank their loves,"
26788,Coriolanus,37,3.2.158,CORIOLANUS,"Cog their hearts from them, and come home beloved"
26789,Coriolanus,37,3.2.159,CORIOLANUS,"Of all the trades in Rome. Look, I am going:"
26790,Coriolanus,37,3.2.160,CORIOLANUS,"Commend me to my wife. I'll return consul,"
26791,Coriolanus,37,3.2.161,CORIOLANUS,Or never trust to what my tongue can do
26792,Coriolanus,37,3.2.162,CORIOLANUS,I' the way of flattery further.
26793,Coriolanus,38,3.2.163,VOLUMNIA,Do your will.
26794,Coriolanus,38,,VOLUMNIA,Exit
26795,Coriolanus,39,3.2.164,COMINIUS,Away! the tribunes do attend you: arm yourself
26796,Coriolanus,39,3.2.165,COMINIUS,"To answer mildly, for they are prepared"
26797,Coriolanus,39,3.2.166,COMINIUS,"With accusations, as I hear, more strong"
26798,Coriolanus,39,3.2.167,COMINIUS,Than are upon you yet.
26799,Coriolanus,40,3.2.168,CORIOLANUS,"The word is 'mildly.' Pray you, let us go:"
26800,Coriolanus,40,3.2.169,CORIOLANUS,"Let them accuse me by invention, I"
26801,Coriolanus,40,3.2.170,CORIOLANUS,Will answer in mine honour.
26802,Coriolanus,41,3.2.171,MENENIUS,"Ay, but mildly."
26803,Coriolanus,42,3.2.172,CORIOLANUS,"Well, mildly be it then. Mildly!"
26804,Coriolanus,42,,CORIOLANUS,Exeunt
26805,Coriolanus,42,,CORIOLANUS,SCENE III. The same. The Forum.
26806,Coriolanus,42,,CORIOLANUS,Enter SICINIUS and BRUTUS
26807,Coriolanus,1,3.3.1,BRUTUS,"In this point charge him home, that he affects"
26808,Coriolanus,1,3.3.2,BRUTUS,"Tyrannical power: if he evade us there,"
26809,Coriolanus,1,3.3.3,BRUTUS,"Enforce him with his envy to the people,"
26810,Coriolanus,1,3.3.4,BRUTUS,And that the spoil got on the Antiates
26811,Coriolanus,1,3.3.5,BRUTUS,Was ne'er distributed.
26812,Coriolanus,1,,BRUTUS,Enter an AEdile
26813,Coriolanus,1,3.3.6,BRUTUS,"What, will he come?"
26814,Coriolanus,2,3.3.7,AEdile,He's coming.
26815,Coriolanus,3,3.3.8,BRUTUS,How accompanied?
26816,Coriolanus,4,3.3.9,AEdile,"With old Menenius, and those senators"
26817,Coriolanus,4,3.3.10,AEdile,That always favour'd him.
26818,Coriolanus,5,3.3.11,SICINIUS,Have you a catalogue
26819,Coriolanus,5,3.3.12,SICINIUS,Of all the voices that we have procured
26820,Coriolanus,5,3.3.13,SICINIUS,Set down by the poll?
26821,Coriolanus,6,3.3.14,AEdile,"I have, 'tis ready."
26822,Coriolanus,7,3.3.15,SICINIUS,Have you collected them by tribes?
26823,Coriolanus,8,3.3.16,AEdile,I have.
26824,Coriolanus,9,3.3.17,SICINIUS,"Assemble presently the people hither,"
26825,Coriolanus,9,3.3.18,SICINIUS,And when they bear me say 'It shall be so
26826,Coriolanus,9,3.3.19,SICINIUS,"I' the right and strength o' the commons,' be it either"
26827,Coriolanus,9,3.3.20,SICINIUS,"For death, for fine, or banishment, then let them"
26828,Coriolanus,9,3.3.21,SICINIUS,"If I say fine, cry 'Fine,' if death, cry 'Death.'"
26829,Coriolanus,9,3.3.22,SICINIUS,Insisting on the old prerogative
26830,Coriolanus,9,3.3.23,SICINIUS,And power i' the truth o' the cause.
26831,Coriolanus,10,3.3.24,AEdile,I shall inform them.
26832,Coriolanus,11,3.3.25,BRUTUS,"And when such time they have begun to cry,"
26833,Coriolanus,11,3.3.26,BRUTUS,"Let them not cease, but with a din confused"
26834,Coriolanus,11,3.3.27,BRUTUS,Enforce the present execution
26835,Coriolanus,11,3.3.28,BRUTUS,Of what we chance to sentence.
26836,Coriolanus,12,3.3.29,AEdile,Very well.
26837,Coriolanus,13,3.3.30,SICINIUS,"Make them be strong and ready for this hint,"
26838,Coriolanus,13,3.3.31,SICINIUS,When we shall hap to give 't them.
26839,Coriolanus,14,3.3.32,BRUTUS,Go about it.
26840,Coriolanus,14,,BRUTUS,Exit AEdile
26841,Coriolanus,14,3.3.33,BRUTUS,Put him to choler straight: he hath been used
26842,Coriolanus,14,3.3.34,BRUTUS,"Ever to conquer, and to have his worth"
26843,Coriolanus,14,3.3.35,BRUTUS,"Of contradiction: being once chafed, he cannot"
26844,Coriolanus,14,3.3.36,BRUTUS,"Be rein'd again to temperance, then he speaks"
26845,Coriolanus,14,3.3.37,BRUTUS,"What's in his heart, and that is there which looks"
26846,Coriolanus,14,3.3.38,BRUTUS,With us to break his neck.
26847,Coriolanus,15,3.3.39,SICINIUS,"Well, here he comes."
26848,Coriolanus,15,,SICINIUS,"Enter CORIOLANUS, MENENIUS, and COMINIUS, with Senators and Patricians"
26849,Coriolanus,16,3.3.40,MENENIUS,"Calmly, I do beseech you."
26850,Coriolanus,17,3.3.41,CORIOLANUS,"Ay, as an ostler, that for the poorest piece"
26851,Coriolanus,17,3.3.42,CORIOLANUS,Will bear the knave by the volume. The honour'd gods
26852,Coriolanus,17,3.3.43,CORIOLANUS,"Keep Rome in safety, and the chairs of justice"
26853,Coriolanus,17,3.3.44,CORIOLANUS,Supplied with worthy men! plant love among 's!
26854,Coriolanus,17,3.3.45,CORIOLANUS,"Throng our large temples with the shows of peace,"
26855,Coriolanus,17,3.3.46,CORIOLANUS,And not our streets with war!
26856,Coriolanus,18,3.3.47,First Senator,"Amen, amen."
26857,Coriolanus,19,3.3.48,MENENIUS,A noble wish.
26858,Coriolanus,19,,MENENIUS,"Re-enter AEdile, with Citizens"
26859,Coriolanus,20,3.3.49,SICINIUS,"Draw near, ye people."
26860,Coriolanus,21,3.3.50,AEdile,"List to your tribunes. Audience: peace, I say!"
26861,Coriolanus,22,3.3.51,CORIOLANUS,"First, hear me speak."
26862,Coriolanus,23,3.3.52,Both Tribunes,"Well, say. Peace, ho!"
26863,Coriolanus,24,3.3.53,CORIOLANUS,Shall I be charged no further than this present?
26864,Coriolanus,24,3.3.54,CORIOLANUS,Must all determine here?
26865,Coriolanus,25,3.3.55,SICINIUS,"I do demand,"
26866,Coriolanus,25,3.3.56,SICINIUS,"If you submit you to the people's voices,"
26867,Coriolanus,25,3.3.57,SICINIUS,Allow their officers and are content
26868,Coriolanus,25,3.3.58,SICINIUS,To suffer lawful censure for such faults
26869,Coriolanus,25,3.3.59,SICINIUS,As shall be proved upon you?
26870,Coriolanus,26,3.3.60,CORIOLANUS,I am content.
26871,Coriolanus,27,3.3.61,MENENIUS,"Lo, citizens, he says he is content:"
26872,Coriolanus,27,3.3.62,MENENIUS,"The warlike service he has done, consider, think"
26873,Coriolanus,27,3.3.63,MENENIUS,"Upon the wounds his body bears, which show"
26874,Coriolanus,27,3.3.64,MENENIUS,Like graves i' the holy churchyard.
26875,Coriolanus,28,3.3.65,CORIOLANUS,"Scratches with briers,"
26876,Coriolanus,28,3.3.66,CORIOLANUS,Scars to move laughter only.
26877,Coriolanus,29,3.3.67,MENENIUS,"Consider further,"
26878,Coriolanus,29,3.3.68,MENENIUS,"That when he speaks not like a citizen,"
26879,Coriolanus,29,3.3.69,MENENIUS,You find him like a soldier: do not take
26880,Coriolanus,29,3.3.70,MENENIUS,"His rougher accents for malicious sounds,"
26881,Coriolanus,29,3.3.71,MENENIUS,"But, as I say, such as become a soldier,"
26882,Coriolanus,29,3.3.72,MENENIUS,Rather than envy you.
26883,Coriolanus,30,3.3.73,COMINIUS,"Well, well, no more."
26884,Coriolanus,31,3.3.74,CORIOLANUS,What is the matter
26885,Coriolanus,31,3.3.75,CORIOLANUS,"That being pass'd for consul with full voice,"
26886,Coriolanus,31,3.3.76,CORIOLANUS,I am so dishonour'd that the very hour
26887,Coriolanus,31,3.3.77,CORIOLANUS,You take it off again?
26888,Coriolanus,32,3.3.78,SICINIUS,Answer to us.
26889,Coriolanus,33,3.3.79,CORIOLANUS,"Say, then: 'tis true, I ought so."
26890,Coriolanus,34,3.3.80,SICINIUS,"We charge you, that you have contrived to take"
26891,Coriolanus,34,3.3.81,SICINIUS,From Rome all season'd office and to wind
26892,Coriolanus,34,3.3.82,SICINIUS,"Yourself into a power tyrannical,"
26893,Coriolanus,34,3.3.83,SICINIUS,For which you are a traitor to the people.
26894,Coriolanus,35,3.3.84,CORIOLANUS,How! traitor!
26895,Coriolanus,36,3.3.85,MENENIUS,"Nay, temperately, your promise."
26896,Coriolanus,37,3.3.86,CORIOLANUS,The fires i' the lowest hell fold-in the people!
26897,Coriolanus,37,3.3.87,CORIOLANUS,Call me their traitor! Thou injurious tribune!
26898,Coriolanus,37,3.3.88,CORIOLANUS,"Within thine eyes sat twenty thousand deaths,"
26899,Coriolanus,37,3.3.89,CORIOLANUS,"In thy hand clutch'd as many millions, in"
26900,Coriolanus,37,3.3.90,CORIOLANUS,"Thy lying tongue both numbers, I would say"
26901,Coriolanus,37,3.3.91,CORIOLANUS,'Thou liest' unto thee with a voice as free
26902,Coriolanus,37,3.3.92,CORIOLANUS,As I do pray the gods.
26903,Coriolanus,38,3.3.93,SICINIUS,"Mark you this, people?"
26904,Coriolanus,39,3.3.94,Citizens,"To the rock, to the rock with him!"
26905,Coriolanus,40,3.3.95,SICINIUS,Peace!
26906,Coriolanus,40,3.3.96,SICINIUS,We need not put new matter to his charge:
26907,Coriolanus,40,3.3.97,SICINIUS,"What you have seen him do and heard him speak,"
26908,Coriolanus,40,3.3.98,SICINIUS,"Beating your officers, cursing yourselves,"
26909,Coriolanus,40,3.3.99,SICINIUS,Opposing laws with strokes and here defying
26910,Coriolanus,40,3.3.100,SICINIUS,"Those whose great power must try him, even this,"
26911,Coriolanus,40,3.3.101,SICINIUS,"So criminal and in such capital kind,"
26912,Coriolanus,40,3.3.102,SICINIUS,Deserves the extremest death.
26913,Coriolanus,41,3.3.103,BRUTUS,But since he hath
26914,Coriolanus,41,3.3.104,BRUTUS,"Served well for Rome,--"
26915,Coriolanus,42,3.3.105,CORIOLANUS,What do you prate of service?
26916,Coriolanus,43,3.3.106,BRUTUS,"I talk of that, that know it."
26917,Coriolanus,44,3.3.107,CORIOLANUS,You?
26918,Coriolanus,45,3.3.108,MENENIUS,Is this the promise that you made your mother?
26919,Coriolanus,46,3.3.109,COMINIUS,"Know, I pray you,--"
26920,Coriolanus,47,3.3.110,CORIOLANUS,I know no further:
26921,Coriolanus,47,3.3.111,CORIOLANUS,"Let them pronounce the steep Tarpeian death,"
26922,Coriolanus,47,3.3.112,CORIOLANUS,"Vagabond exile, raying, pent to linger"
26923,Coriolanus,47,3.3.113,CORIOLANUS,"But with a grain a day, I would not buy"
26924,Coriolanus,47,3.3.114,CORIOLANUS,"Their mercy at the price of one fair word,"
26925,Coriolanus,47,3.3.115,CORIOLANUS,"Nor cheque my courage for what they can give,"
26926,Coriolanus,47,3.3.116,CORIOLANUS,To have't with saying 'Good morrow.'
26927,Coriolanus,48,3.3.117,SICINIUS,"For that he has,"
26928,Coriolanus,48,3.3.118,SICINIUS,"As much as in him lies, from time to time"
26929,Coriolanus,48,3.3.119,SICINIUS,"Envied against the people, seeking means"
26930,Coriolanus,48,3.3.120,SICINIUS,"To pluck away their power, as now at last"
26931,Coriolanus,48,3.3.121,SICINIUS,"Given hostile strokes, and that not in the presence"
26932,Coriolanus,48,3.3.122,SICINIUS,"Of dreaded justice, but on the ministers"
26933,Coriolanus,48,3.3.123,SICINIUS,"That do distribute it, in the name o' the people"
26934,Coriolanus,48,3.3.124,SICINIUS,"And in the power of us the tribunes, we,"
26935,Coriolanus,48,3.3.125,SICINIUS,"Even from this instant, banish him our city,"
26936,Coriolanus,48,3.3.126,SICINIUS,In peril of precipitation
26937,Coriolanus,48,3.3.127,SICINIUS,From off the rock Tarpeian never more
26938,Coriolanus,48,3.3.128,SICINIUS,"To enter our Rome gates: i' the people's name,"
26939,Coriolanus,48,3.3.129,SICINIUS,I say it shall be so.
26940,Coriolanus,49,3.3.130,Citizens,"It shall be so, it shall be so, let him away:"
26941,Coriolanus,49,3.3.131,Citizens,"He's banish'd, and it shall be so."
26942,Coriolanus,50,3.3.132,COMINIUS,"Hear me, my masters, and my common friends,--"
26943,Coriolanus,51,3.3.133,SICINIUS,"He's sentenced, no more hearing."
26944,Coriolanus,52,3.3.134,COMINIUS,Let me speak:
26945,Coriolanus,52,3.3.135,COMINIUS,"I have been consul, and can show for Rome"
26946,Coriolanus,52,3.3.136,COMINIUS,Her enemies' marks upon me. I do love
26947,Coriolanus,52,3.3.137,COMINIUS,"My country's good with a respect more tender,"
26948,Coriolanus,52,3.3.138,COMINIUS,"More holy and profound, than mine own life,"
26949,Coriolanus,52,3.3.139,COMINIUS,"My dear wife's estimate, her womb's increase,"
26950,Coriolanus,52,3.3.140,COMINIUS,"And treasure of my loins, then if I would"
26951,Coriolanus,52,3.3.141,COMINIUS,"Speak that,--"
26952,Coriolanus,53,3.3.142,SICINIUS,We know your drift: speak what?
26953,Coriolanus,54,3.3.143,BRUTUS,"There's no more to be said, but he is banish'd,"
26954,Coriolanus,54,3.3.144,BRUTUS,As enemy to the people and his country:
26955,Coriolanus,54,3.3.145,BRUTUS,It shall be so.
26956,Coriolanus,55,3.3.146,Citizens,"It shall be so, it shall be so."
26957,Coriolanus,56,3.3.147,CORIOLANUS,You common cry of curs! whose breath I hate
26958,Coriolanus,56,3.3.148,CORIOLANUS,"As reek o' the rotten fens, whose loves I prize"
26959,Coriolanus,56,3.3.149,CORIOLANUS,As the dead carcasses of unburied men
26960,Coriolanus,56,3.3.150,CORIOLANUS,"That do corrupt my air, I banish you,"
26961,Coriolanus,56,3.3.151,CORIOLANUS,And here remain with your uncertainty!
26962,Coriolanus,56,3.3.152,CORIOLANUS,Let every feeble rumour shake your hearts!
26963,Coriolanus,56,3.3.153,CORIOLANUS,"Your enemies, with nodding of their plumes,"
26964,Coriolanus,56,3.3.154,CORIOLANUS,Fan you into despair! Have the power still
26965,Coriolanus,56,3.3.155,CORIOLANUS,"To banish your defenders, till at length"
26966,Coriolanus,56,3.3.156,CORIOLANUS,"Your ignorance, which finds not till it feels,"
26967,Coriolanus,56,3.3.157,CORIOLANUS,"Making not reservation of yourselves,"
26968,Coriolanus,56,3.3.158,CORIOLANUS,"Still your own foes, deliver you as most"
26969,Coriolanus,56,3.3.159,CORIOLANUS,Abated captives to some nation

26971,Coriolanus,56,3.3.161,CORIOLANUS,"For you, the city, thus I turn my back:"
26972,Coriolanus,56,3.3.162,CORIOLANUS,There is a world elsewhere.

26989,Coriolanus,1,4.1.3,CORIOLANUS,Where is your ancient courage? you were used
26990,Coriolanus,1,4.1.4,CORIOLANUS,"To say extremity was the trier of spirits,"
26991,Coriolanus,1,4.1.5,CORIOLANUS,"That common chances common men could bear,"
26992,Coriolanus,1,4.1.6,CORIOLANUS,That when the sea was calm all boats alike
26993,Coriolanus,1,4.1.7,CORIOLANUS,"Show'd mastership in floating, fortune's blows,"

27137,Coriolanus,5,4.3.7,Roman,"The same, sir."
27138,Coriolanus,6,4.3.8,Volsce,"You had more beard when I last saw you, but your"
27139,Coriolanus,6,4.3.9,Volsce,favour is well approved by your tongue. What's the

27141,Coriolanus,6,4.3.11,Volsce,to find you out there: you have well saved me a
27142,Coriolanus,6,4.3.12,Volsce,day's journey.
27143,Coriolanus,7,4.3.13,Roman,"There hath been in Rome strange insurrections, the"

27147,Coriolanus,8,4.3.17,Volsce,hope to come upon them in the heat of their division.
27148,Coriolanus,9,4.3.18,Roman,"The main blaze of it is past, but a small thing"
27149,Coriolanus,9,4.3.19,Roman,would make it flame again: for the nobles receive
27150,Coriolanus,9,4.3.20,Roman,so to heart the banishment of that worthy
27151,Coriolanus,9,4.3.21,Roman,"Coriolanus, that they are in a ripe aptness to take"

27159,Coriolanus,13,4.3.29,Roman,The day serves well for them now. I have heard it
27160,Coriolanus,13,4.3.30,Roman,"said, the fittest time to corrupt a man's wife is"
27161,Coriolanus,13,4.3.31,Roman,when she's fallen out with her husband. Your noble

27168,Coriolanus,15,4.3.38,Roman,"I shall, between this and supper, tell you most"

27171,Coriolanus,16,4.3.41,Volsce,"A most royal one, the centurions and their charges,"
27172,Coriolanus,16,4.3.42,Volsce,"distinctly billeted, already in the entertainment,"
27173,Coriolanus,16,4.3.43,Volsce,and to be on foot at an hour's warning.

27240,Coriolanus,9,4.5.16,CORIOLANUS,Now thou'rt troublesome.
27241,Coriolanus,10,4.5.17,Second Servingman,Are you so brave? I'll have you talked with anon.
27242,Coriolanus,10,,Second Servingman,Enter a third Servingman. The first meets him
27243,Coriolanus,11,4.5.18,Third Servingman,What fellow's this?
27244,Coriolanus,12,4.5.19,First Servingman,A strange one as ever I looked on: I cannot get him
27245,Coriolanus,12,4.5.20,First Servingman,"out of the house: prithee, call my master to him."
27246,Coriolanus,12,,First Servingman,Retires
27247,Coriolanus,13,4.5.21,Third Servingman,"What have you to do here, fellow? Pray you, avoid"
27248,Coriolanus,13,4.5.22,Third Servingman,the house.
27249,Coriolanus,14,4.5.23,CORIOLANUS,"Let me but stand, I will not hurt your hearth."
27250,Coriolanus,15,4.5.24,Third Servingman,What are you?
27251,Coriolanus,16,4.5.25,CORIOLANUS,A gentleman.
27252,Coriolanus,17,4.5.26,Third Servingman,A marvellous poor one.
27253,Coriolanus,18,4.5.27,CORIOLANUS,"True, so I am."
27254,Coriolanus,19,4.5.28,Third Servingman,"Pray you, poor gentleman, take up some other"
27255,Coriolanus,19,4.5.29,Third Servingman,"station, here's no place for you, pray you, avoid: come."
27256,Coriolanus,20,4.5.30,CORIOLANUS,"Follow your function, go, and batten on cold bits."
27257,Coriolanus,20,,CORIOLANUS,Pushes him away
27258,Coriolanus,21,4.5.31,Third Servingman,"What, you will not? Prithee, tell my master what a"
27259,Coriolanus,21,4.5.32,Third Servingman,strange guest he has here.
27260,Coriolanus,22,4.5.33,Second Servingman,And I shall.
27261,Coriolanus,22,,Second Servingman,Exit
27262,Coriolanus,23,4.5.34,Third Servingman,Where dwellest thou?
27263,Coriolanus,24,4.5.35,CORIOLANUS,Under the canopy.
27264,Coriolanus,25,4.5.36,Third Servingman,Under the canopy!
27265,Coriolanus,26,4.5.37,CORIOLANUS,Ay.
27266,Coriolanus,27,4.5.38,Third Servingman,Where's that?
27267,Coriolanus,28,4.5.39,CORIOLANUS,I' the city of kites and crows.
27268,Coriolanus,29,4.5.40,Third Servingman,I' the city of kites and crows! What an ass it is!
27269,Coriolanus,29,4.5.41,Third Servingman,Then thou dwellest with daws too?
27270,Coriolanus,30,4.5.42,CORIOLANUS,"No, I serve not thy master."
27271,Coriolanus,31,4.5.43,Third Servingman,"How, sir! do you meddle with my master?"
27272,Coriolanus,32,4.5.44,CORIOLANUS,"Ay, 'tis an honester service than to meddle with thy"
27273,Coriolanus,32,4.5.45,CORIOLANUS,"mistress. Thou pratest, and pratest, serve with thy"
27274,Coriolanus,32,4.5.46,CORIOLANUS,"trencher, hence!"
27275,Coriolanus,32,,CORIOLANUS,Beats him away. Exit third Servingman
27276,Coriolanus,32,,CORIOLANUS,Enter AUFIDIUS with the second Servingman
27277,Coriolanus,33,4.5.47,AUFIDIUS,Where is this fellow?
27278,Coriolanus,34,4.5.48,Second Servingman,"Here, sir: I'ld have beaten him like a dog, but for"
27279,Coriolanus,34,4.5.49,Second Servingman,disturbing the lords within.
27280,Coriolanus,34,,Second Servingman,Retires
27281,Coriolanus,35,4.5.50,AUFIDIUS,Whence comest thou? what wouldst thou? thy name?
27282,Coriolanus,35,4.5.51,AUFIDIUS,"Why speak'st not? speak, man: what's thy name?"
27283,Coriolanus,36,4.5.52,CORIOLANUS,"If, Tullus,"
27284,Coriolanus,36,,CORIOLANUS,Unmuffling
27285,Coriolanus,36,4.5.53,CORIOLANUS,"Not yet thou knowest me, and, seeing me, dost not"
27286,Coriolanus,36,4.5.54,CORIOLANUS,"Think me for the man I am, necessity"
27287,Coriolanus,36,4.5.55,CORIOLANUS,Commands me name myself.
27288,Coriolanus,37,4.5.56,AUFIDIUS,What is thy name?
27289,Coriolanus,38,4.5.57,CORIOLANUS,"A name unmusical to the Volscians' ears,"
27290,Coriolanus,38,4.5.58,CORIOLANUS,And harsh in sound to thine.
27291,Coriolanus,39,4.5.59,AUFIDIUS,"Say, what's thy name?"
27292,Coriolanus,39,4.5.60,AUFIDIUS,"Thou hast a grim appearance, and thy face"
27293,Coriolanus,39,4.5.61,AUFIDIUS,"Bears a command in't, though thy tackle's torn."
27294,Coriolanus,39,4.5.62,AUFIDIUS,Thou show'st a noble vessel: what's thy name?
27295,Coriolanus,40,4.5.63,CORIOLANUS,Prepare thy brow to frown: know'st
27296,Coriolanus,40,4.5.64,CORIOLANUS,thou me yet?
27297,Coriolanus,41,4.5.65,AUFIDIUS,I know thee not: thy name?
27298,Coriolanus,42,4.5.66,CORIOLANUS,"My name is Caius Marcius, who hath done"
27299,Coriolanus,42,4.5.67,CORIOLANUS,To thee particularly and to all the Volsces
27300,Coriolanus,42,4.5.68,CORIOLANUS,"Great hurt and mischief, thereto witness may"
27301,Coriolanus,42,4.5.69,CORIOLANUS,"My surname, Coriolanus: the painful service,"
27302,Coriolanus,42,4.5.70,CORIOLANUS,The extreme dangers and the drops of blood
27303,Coriolanus,42,4.5.71,CORIOLANUS,Shed for my thankless country are requited
27304,Coriolanus,42,4.5.72,CORIOLANUS,"But with that surname, a good memory,"
27305,Coriolanus,42,4.5.73,CORIOLANUS,And witness of the malice and displeasure
27306,Coriolanus,42,4.5.74,CORIOLANUS,"Which thou shouldst bear me: only that name remains,"
27307,Coriolanus,42,4.5.75,CORIOLANUS,"The cruelty and envy of the people,"
27308,Coriolanus,42,4.5.76,CORIOLANUS,"Permitted by our dastard nobles, who"
27309,Coriolanus,42,4.5.77,CORIOLANUS,"Have all forsook me, hath devour'd the rest,"
27310,Coriolanus,42,4.5.78,CORIOLANUS,And suffer'd me by the voice of slaves to be
27311,Coriolanus,42,4.5.79,CORIOLANUS,Whoop'd out of Rome. Now this extremity
27312,Coriolanus,42,4.5.80,CORIOLANUS,"Hath brought me to thy hearth, not out of hope--"
27313,Coriolanus,42,4.5.81,CORIOLANUS,"Mistake me not--to save my life, for if"
27314,Coriolanus,42,4.5.82,CORIOLANUS,"I had fear'd death, of all the men i' the world"
27315,Coriolanus,42,4.5.83,CORIOLANUS,"I would have 'voided thee, but in mere spite,"
27316,Coriolanus,42,4.5.84,CORIOLANUS,"To be full quit of those my banishers,"
27317,Coriolanus,42,4.5.85,CORIOLANUS,Stand I before thee here. Then if thou hast
27318,Coriolanus,42,4.5.86,CORIOLANUS,"A heart of wreak in thee, that wilt revenge"
27319,Coriolanus,42,4.5.87,CORIOLANUS,Thine own particular wrongs and stop those maims
27320,Coriolanus,42,4.5.88,CORIOLANUS,"Of shame seen through thy country, speed"
27321,Coriolanus,42,4.5.89,CORIOLANUS,"thee straight,"
27322,Coriolanus,42,4.5.90,CORIOLANUS,And make my misery serve thy turn: so use it
27323,Coriolanus,42,4.5.91,CORIOLANUS,That my revengeful services may prove
27324,Coriolanus,42,4.5.92,CORIOLANUS,"As benefits to thee, for I will fight"
27325,Coriolanus,42,4.5.93,CORIOLANUS,Against my canker'd country with the spleen
27326,Coriolanus,42,4.5.94,CORIOLANUS,Of all the under fiends. But if so be
27327,Coriolanus,42,4.5.95,CORIOLANUS,Thou darest not this and that to prove more fortunes
27328,Coriolanus,42,4.5.96,CORIOLANUS,"Thou'rt tired, then, in a word, I also am"
27329,Coriolanus,42,4.5.97,CORIOLANUS,"Longer to live most weary, and present"
27330,Coriolanus,42,4.5.98,CORIOLANUS,"My throat to thee and to thy ancient malice,"
27331,Coriolanus,42,4.5.99,CORIOLANUS,"Which not to cut would show thee but a fool,"
27332,Coriolanus,42,4.5.100,CORIOLANUS,"Since I have ever follow'd thee with hate,"
27333,Coriolanus,42,4.5.101,CORIOLANUS,"Drawn tuns of blood out of thy country's breast,"
27334,Coriolanus,42,4.5.102,CORIOLANUS,"And cannot live but to thy shame, unless"
27335,Coriolanus,42,4.5.103,CORIOLANUS,It be to do thee service.
27336,Coriolanus,43,4.5.104,AUFIDIUS,"O Marcius, Marcius!"
27337,Coriolanus,43,4.5.105,AUFIDIUS,Each word thou hast spoke hath weeded from my heart
27338,Coriolanus,43,4.5.106,AUFIDIUS,A root of ancient envy. If Jupiter
27339,Coriolanus,43,4.5.107,AUFIDIUS,"Should from yond cloud speak divine things,"
27340,Coriolanus,43,4.5.108,AUFIDIUS,"And say 'Tis true,' I'ld not believe them more"
27341,Coriolanus,43,4.5.109,AUFIDIUS,"Than thee, all noble Marcius. Let me twine"
27342,Coriolanus,43,4.5.110,AUFIDIUS,"Mine arms about that body, where against"
27343,Coriolanus,43,4.5.111,AUFIDIUS,My grained ash an hundred times hath broke
27344,Coriolanus,43,4.5.112,AUFIDIUS,And scarr'd the moon with splinters: here I clip
27345,Coriolanus,43,4.5.113,AUFIDIUS,"The anvil of my sword, and do contest"
27346,Coriolanus,43,4.5.114,AUFIDIUS,As hotly and as nobly with thy love
27347,Coriolanus,43,4.5.115,AUFIDIUS,As ever in ambitious strength I did
27348,Coriolanus,43,4.5.116,AUFIDIUS,"Contend against thy valour. Know thou first,"
27349,Coriolanus,43,4.5.117,AUFIDIUS,"I loved the maid I married, never man"
27350,Coriolanus,43,4.5.118,AUFIDIUS,"Sigh'd truer breath, but that I see thee here,"
27351,Coriolanus,43,4.5.119,AUFIDIUS,Thou noble thing! more dances my rapt heart
27352,Coriolanus,43,4.5.120,AUFIDIUS,Than when I first my wedded mistress saw
27353,Coriolanus,43,4.5.121,AUFIDIUS,"Bestride my threshold. Why, thou Mars! I tell thee,"
27354,Coriolanus,43,4.5.122,AUFIDIUS,"We have a power on foot, and I had purpose"
27355,Coriolanus,43,4.5.123,AUFIDIUS,"Once more to hew thy target from thy brawn,"
27356,Coriolanus,43,4.5.124,AUFIDIUS,Or lose mine arm fort: thou hast beat me out
27357,Coriolanus,43,4.5.125,AUFIDIUS,"Twelve several times, and I have nightly since"
27358,Coriolanus,43,4.5.126,AUFIDIUS,"Dreamt of encounters 'twixt thyself and me,"
27359,Coriolanus,43,4.5.127,AUFIDIUS,"We have been down together in my sleep,"
27360,Coriolanus,43,4.5.128,AUFIDIUS,"Unbuckling helms, fisting each other's throat,"
27361,Coriolanus,43,4.5.129,AUFIDIUS,"And waked half dead with nothing. Worthy Marcius,"
27362,Coriolanus,43,4.5.130,AUFIDIUS,"Had we no quarrel else to Rome, but that"
27363,Coriolanus,43,4.5.131,AUFIDIUS,"Thou art thence banish'd, we would muster all"
27364,Coriolanus,43,4.5.132,AUFIDIUS,"From twelve to seventy, and pouring war"
27365,Coriolanus,43,4.5.133,AUFIDIUS,"Into the bowels of ungrateful Rome,"
27366,Coriolanus,43,4.5.134,AUFIDIUS,"Like a bold flood o'er-bear. O, come, go in,"
27367,Coriolanus,43,4.5.135,AUFIDIUS,"And take our friendly senators by the hands,"
27368,Coriolanus,43,4.5.136,AUFIDIUS,"Who now are here, taking their leaves of me,"
27369,Coriolanus,43,4.5.137,AUFIDIUS,"Who am prepared against your territories,"
27370,Coriolanus,43,4.5.138,AUFIDIUS,Though not for Rome itself.
27371,Coriolanus,44,4.5.139,CORIOLANUS,"You bless me, gods!"
27372,Coriolanus,45,4.5.140,AUFIDIUS,"Therefore, most absolute sir, if thou wilt have"
27373,Coriolanus,45,4.5.141,AUFIDIUS,"The leading of thine own revenges, take"
27374,Coriolanus,45,4.5.142,AUFIDIUS,"The one half of my commission, and set down--"
27375,Coriolanus,45,4.5.143,AUFIDIUS,"As best thou art experienced, since thou know'st"
27376,Coriolanus,45,4.5.144,AUFIDIUS,"Thy country's strength and weakness,--thine own ways,"
27377,Coriolanus,45,4.5.145,AUFIDIUS,"Whether to knock against the gates of Rome,"
27378,Coriolanus,45,4.5.146,AUFIDIUS,"Or rudely visit them in parts remote,"
27379,Coriolanus,45,4.5.147,AUFIDIUS,"To fright them, ere destroy. But come in:"
27380,Coriolanus,45,4.5.148,AUFIDIUS,Let me commend thee first to those that shall
27381,Coriolanus,45,4.5.149,AUFIDIUS,Say yea to thy desires. A thousand welcomes!
27382,Coriolanus,45,4.5.150,AUFIDIUS,"And more a friend than e'er an enemy,"
27383,Coriolanus,45,4.5.151,AUFIDIUS,"Yet, Marcius, that was much. Your hand: most welcome!"
27384,Coriolanus,45,,AUFIDIUS,Exeunt CORIOLANUS and AUFIDIUS. The two Servingmen come forward
27385,Coriolanus,46,4.5.152,First Servingman,Here's a strange alteration!
27386,Coriolanus,47,4.5.153,Second Servingman,"By my hand, I had thought to have strucken him with"
27387,Coriolanus,47,4.5.154,Second Servingman,"a cudgel, and yet my mind gave me his clothes made a"
27388,Coriolanus,47,4.5.155,Second Servingman,false report of him.
27389,Coriolanus,48,4.5.156,First Servingman,What an arm he has! he turned me about with his
27390,Coriolanus,48,4.5.157,First Servingman,"finger and his thumb, as one would set up a top."
27391,Coriolanus,49,4.5.158,Second Servingman,"Nay, I knew by his face that there was something in"
27392,Coriolanus,49,4.5.159,Second Servingman,"him: he had, sir, a kind of face, methought,--I"
27393,Coriolanus,49,4.5.160,Second Servingman,cannot tell how to term it.
27394,Coriolanus,50,4.5.161,First Servingman,"He had so, looking as it were--would I were hanged,"
27395,Coriolanus,50,4.5.162,First Servingman,but I thought there was more in him than I could think.
27396,Coriolanus,51,4.5.163,Second Servingman,"So did I, I'll be sworn: he is simply the rarest"
27397,Coriolanus,51,4.5.164,Second Servingman,man i' the world.
27398,Coriolanus,52,4.5.165,First Servingman,I think he is: but a greater soldier than he you wot on.
27399,Coriolanus,53,4.5.166,Second Servingman,"Who, my master?"
27400,Coriolanus,54,4.5.167,First Servingman,"Nay, it's no matter for that."
27401,Coriolanus,55,4.5.168,Second Servingman,Worth six on him.
27402,Coriolanus,56,4.5.169,First Servingman,"Nay, not so neither: but I take him to be the"
27403,Coriolanus,56,4.5.170,First Servingman,greater soldier.
27404,Coriolanus,57,4.5.171,Second Servingman,"Faith, look you, one cannot tell how to say that:"
27405,Coriolanus,57,4.5.172,Second Servingman,"for the defence of a town, our general is excellent."
27406,Coriolanus,58,4.5.173,First Servingman,"Ay, and for an assault too."
27407,Coriolanus,58,,First Servingman,Re-enter third Servingman
27408,Coriolanus,59,4.5.174,Third Servingman,"O slaves, I can tell you news,-- news, you rascals!"
27409,Coriolanus,61,4.5.175,Second Servingman,"What, what, what? let's partake."
27410,Coriolanus,62,4.5.176,Third Servingman,"I would not be a Roman, of all nations, I had as"
27411,Coriolanus,62,4.5.177,Third Servingman,lieve be a condemned man.
27412,Coriolanus,64,4.5.178,Second Servingman,Wherefore? wherefore?
27413,Coriolanus,65,4.5.179,Third Servingman,"Why, here's he that was wont to thwack our general,"
27414,Coriolanus,65,4.5.180,Third Servingman,Caius Marcius.
27415,Coriolanus,66,4.5.181,First Servingman,Why do you say 'thwack our general '?
27416,Coriolanus,67,4.5.182,Third Servingman,"I do not say 'thwack our general,' but he was always"
27417,Coriolanus,67,4.5.183,Third Servingman,good enough for him.
27418,Coriolanus,68,4.5.184,Second Servingman,"Come, we are fellows and friends: he was ever too"
27419,Coriolanus,68,4.5.185,Second Servingman,"hard for him, I have heard him say so himself."
27420,Coriolanus,69,4.5.186,First Servingman,"He was too hard for him directly, to say the troth"
27421,Coriolanus,69,4.5.187,First Servingman,on't: before Corioli he scotched him and notched
27422,Coriolanus,69,4.5.188,First Servingman,him like a carbon ado.
27423,Coriolanus,70,4.5.189,Second Servingman,"An he had been cannibally given, he might have"
27424,Coriolanus,70,4.5.190,Second Servingman,broiled and eaten him too.
27425,Coriolanus,71,4.5.191,First Servingman,"But, more of thy news?"
27426,Coriolanus,72,4.5.192,Third Servingman,"Why, he is so made on here within, as if he were son"
27427,Coriolanus,72,4.5.193,Third Servingman,"and heir to Mars, set at upper end o' the table, no"
27428,Coriolanus,72,4.5.194,Third Servingman,"question asked him by any of the senators, but they"
27429,Coriolanus,72,4.5.195,Third Servingman,stand bald before him: our general himself makes a
27430,Coriolanus,72,4.5.196,Third Servingman,mistress of him: sanctifies himself with's hand and
27431,Coriolanus,72,4.5.197,Third Servingman,turns up the white o' the eye to his discourse. But
27432,Coriolanus,72,4.5.198,Third Servingman,the bottom of the news is that our general is cut i'
27433,Coriolanus,72,4.5.199,Third Servingman,the middle and but one half of what he was
27434,Coriolanus,72,4.5.200,Third Servingman,"yesterday, for the other has half, by the entreaty"
27435,Coriolanus,72,4.5.201,Third Servingman,"and grant of the whole table. He'll go, he says,"
27436,Coriolanus,72,4.5.202,Third Servingman,and sowl the porter of Rome gates by the ears: he
27437,Coriolanus,72,4.5.203,Third Servingman,"will mow all down before him, and leave his passage polled."
27438,Coriolanus,73,4.5.204,Second Servingman,And he's as like to do't as any man I can imagine.
27439,Coriolanus,74,4.5.205,Third Servingman,"Do't! he will do't, for, look you, sir, he has as"
27440,Coriolanus,74,4.5.206,Third Servingman,"many friends as enemies, which friends, sir, as it"
27441,Coriolanus,74,4.5.207,Third Servingman,"were, durst not, look you, sir, show themselves, as"
27442,Coriolanus,74,4.5.208,Third Servingman,"we term it, his friends whilst he's in directitude."
27443,Coriolanus,75,4.5.209,First Servingman,Directitude! what's that?
27444,Coriolanus,76,4.5.210,Third Servingman,"But when they shall see, sir, his crest up again,"
27445,Coriolanus,76,4.5.211,Third Servingman,"and the man in blood, they will out of their"
27446,Coriolanus,76,4.5.212,Third Servingman,"burrows, like conies after rain, and revel all with"
27447,Coriolanus,76,4.5.213,Third Servingman,him.
27448,Coriolanus,77,4.5.214,First Servingman,But when goes this forward?
27449,Coriolanus,78,4.5.215,Third Servingman,"To-morrow, to-day, presently, you shall have the"
27450,Coriolanus,78,4.5.216,Third Servingman,"drum struck up this afternoon: 'tis, as it were, a"
27451,Coriolanus,78,4.5.217,Third Servingman,"parcel of their feast, and to be executed ere they"
27452,Coriolanus,78,4.5.218,Third Servingman,wipe their lips.
27453,Coriolanus,79,4.5.219,Second Servingman,"Why, then we shall have a stirring world again."
27454,Coriolanus,79,4.5.220,Second Servingman,"This peace is nothing, but to rust iron, increase"
27455,Coriolanus,79,4.5.221,Second Servingman,"tailors, and breed ballad-makers."
27456,Coriolanus,80,4.5.222,First Servingman,"Let me have war, say I, it exceeds peace as far as"
27457,Coriolanus,80,4.5.223,First Servingman,"day does night, it's spritely, waking, audible, and"
27458,Coriolanus,80,4.5.224,First Servingman,"full of vent. Peace is a very apoplexy, lethargy,"
27459,Coriolanus,80,4.5.225,First Servingman,"mulled, deaf, sleepy, insensible, a getter of more"
27460,Coriolanus,80,4.5.226,First Servingman,bastard children than war's a destroyer of men.
27461,Coriolanus,81,4.5.227,Second Servingman,"'Tis so: and as war, in some sort, may be said to"
27462,Coriolanus,81,4.5.228,Second Servingman,"be a ravisher, so it cannot be denied but peace is a"
27463,Coriolanus,81,4.5.229,Second Servingman,great maker of cuckolds.
27464,Coriolanus,82,4.5.230,First Servingman,"Ay, and it makes men hate one another."
27465,Coriolanus,83,4.5.231,Third Servingman,"Reason, because they then less need one another."
27466,Coriolanus,83,4.5.232,Third Servingman,The wars for my money. I hope to see Romans as cheap
27467,Coriolanus,83,4.5.233,Third Servingman,"as Volscians. They are rising, they are rising."
27468,Coriolanus,84,4.5.234,All,"In, in, in, in!"
27469,Coriolanus,84,,All,Exeunt
27470,Coriolanus,84,,All,SCENE VI. Rome. A public place.
27471,Coriolanus,84,,All,Enter SICINIUS and BRUTUS
27472,Coriolanus,1,4.6.1,SICINIUS,"We hear not of him, neither need we fear him,"
27473,Coriolanus,1,4.6.2,SICINIUS,His remedies are tame i' the present peace
27474,Coriolanus,1,4.6.3,SICINIUS,"And quietness of the people, which before"
27475,Coriolanus,1,4.6.4,SICINIUS,Were in wild hurry. Here do we make his friends
27476,Coriolanus,1,4.6.5,SICINIUS,"Blush that the world goes well, who rather had,"
27477,Coriolanus,1,4.6.6,SICINIUS,"Though they themselves did suffer by't, behold"
27478,Coriolanus,1,4.6.7,SICINIUS,Dissentious numbers pestering streets than see
27479,Coriolanus,1,4.6.8,SICINIUS,Our tradesmen with in their shops and going
27480,Coriolanus,1,4.6.9,SICINIUS,About their functions friendly.
27481,Coriolanus,2,4.6.10,BRUTUS,We stood to't in good time.
27482,Coriolanus,2,,BRUTUS,Enter MENENIUS
27483,Coriolanus,2,4.6.11,BRUTUS,Is this Menenius?
27484,Coriolanus,3,4.6.12,SICINIUS,"'Tis he,'tis he: O, he is grown most kind of late."
27485,Coriolanus,4,4.6.13,Both Tribunes,Hail sir!
27486,Coriolanus,5,4.6.14,MENENIUS,Hail to you both!
27487,Coriolanus,6,4.6.15,SICINIUS,Your Coriolanus
27488,Coriolanus,6,4.6.16,SICINIUS,"Is not much miss'd, but with his friends:"
27489,Coriolanus,6,4.6.17,SICINIUS,"The commonwealth doth stand, and so would do,"
27490,Coriolanus,6,4.6.18,SICINIUS,Were he more angry at it.
27491,Coriolanus,7,4.6.19,MENENIUS,"All's well, and might have been much better, if"
27492,Coriolanus,7,4.6.20,MENENIUS,He could have temporized.
27493,Coriolanus,8,4.6.21,SICINIUS,"Where is he, hear you?"
27494,Coriolanus,9,4.6.22,MENENIUS,"Nay, I hear nothing: his mother and his wife"
27495,Coriolanus,9,4.6.23,MENENIUS,Hear nothing from him.
27496,Coriolanus,9,,MENENIUS,Enter three or four Citizens
27497,Coriolanus,10,4.6.24,Citizens,The gods preserve you both!
27498,Coriolanus,11,4.6.25,SICINIUS,"God-den, our neighbours."
27499,Coriolanus,12,4.6.26,BRUTUS,"God-den to you all, god-den to you all."
27500,Coriolanus,13,4.6.27,First Citizen,"Ourselves, our wives, and children, on our knees,"
27501,Coriolanus,13,4.6.28,First Citizen,Are bound to pray for you both.
27502,Coriolanus,14,4.6.29,SICINIUS,"Live, and thrive!"
27503,Coriolanus,15,4.6.30,BRUTUS,"Farewell, kind neighbours: we wish'd Coriolanus"
27504,Coriolanus,15,4.6.31,BRUTUS,Had loved you as we did.
27505,Coriolanus,16,4.6.32,Citizens,Now the gods keep you!
27506,Coriolanus,17,4.6.33,Both Tribunes,"Farewell, farewell."
27507,Coriolanus,17,,Both Tribunes,Exeunt Citizens
27508,Coriolanus,18,4.6.34,SICINIUS,This is a happier and more comely time
27509,Coriolanus,18,4.6.35,SICINIUS,"Than when these fellows ran about the streets,"
27510,Coriolanus,18,4.6.36,SICINIUS,Crying confusion.
27511,Coriolanus,19,4.6.37,BRUTUS,Caius Marcius was
27512,Coriolanus,19,4.6.38,BRUTUS,"A worthy officer i' the war, but insolent,"
27513,Coriolanus,19,4.6.39,BRUTUS,"O'ercome with pride, ambitious past all thinking,"
27514,Coriolanus,19,4.6.40,BRUTUS,"Self-loving,--"
27515,Coriolanus,20,4.6.41,SICINIUS,"And affecting one sole throne,"
27516,Coriolanus,20,4.6.42,SICINIUS,Without assistance.
27517,Coriolanus,21,4.6.43,MENENIUS,I think not so.
27518,Coriolanus,22,4.6.44,SICINIUS,"We should by this, to all our lamentation,"
27519,Coriolanus,22,4.6.45,SICINIUS,"If he had gone forth consul, found it so."
27520,Coriolanus,23,4.6.46,BRUTUS,"The gods have well prevented it, and Rome"
27521,Coriolanus,23,4.6.47,BRUTUS,Sits safe and still without him.
27522,Coriolanus,23,,BRUTUS,Enter an AEdile
27523,Coriolanus,24,4.6.48,AEdile,"Worthy tribunes,"
27524,Coriolanus,24,4.6.49,AEdile,"There is a slave, whom we have put in prison,"
27525,Coriolanus,24,4.6.50,AEdile,"Reports, the Volsces with two several powers"
27526,Coriolanus,24,4.6.51,AEdile,"Are enter'd in the Roman territories,"
27527,Coriolanus,24,4.6.52,AEdile,And with the deepest malice of the war
27528,Coriolanus,24,4.6.53,AEdile,Destroy what lies before 'em.
27529,Coriolanus,25,4.6.54,MENENIUS,"'Tis Aufidius,"
27530,Coriolanus,25,4.6.55,MENENIUS,"Who, hearing of our Marcius' banishment,"
27531,Coriolanus,25,4.6.56,MENENIUS,"Thrusts forth his horns again into the world,"
27532,Coriolanus,25,4.6.57,MENENIUS,"Which were inshell'd when Marcius stood for Rome,"
27533,Coriolanus,25,4.6.58,MENENIUS,And durst not once peep out.
27534,Coriolanus,26,4.6.59,SICINIUS,"Come, what talk you"
27535,Coriolanus,26,4.6.60,SICINIUS,Of Marcius?
27536,Coriolanus,27,4.6.61,BRUTUS,Go see this rumourer whipp'd. It cannot be
27537,Coriolanus,27,4.6.62,BRUTUS,The Volsces dare break with us.
27538,Coriolanus,28,4.6.63,MENENIUS,Cannot be!
27539,Coriolanus,28,4.6.64,MENENIUS,"We have record that very well it can,"
27540,Coriolanus,28,4.6.65,MENENIUS,And three examples of the like have been
27541,Coriolanus,28,4.6.66,MENENIUS,"Within my age. But reason with the fellow,"
27542,Coriolanus,28,4.6.67,MENENIUS,"Before you punish him, where he heard this,"
27543,Coriolanus,28,4.6.68,MENENIUS,Lest you shall chance to whip your information
27544,Coriolanus,28,4.6.69,MENENIUS,And beat the messenger who bids beware
27545,Coriolanus,28,4.6.70,MENENIUS,Of what is to be dreaded.
27546,Coriolanus,29,4.6.71,SICINIUS,Tell not me:
27547,Coriolanus,29,4.6.72,SICINIUS,I know this cannot be.
27548,Coriolanus,30,4.6.73,BRUTUS,Not possible.
27549,Coriolanus,30,,BRUTUS,Enter a Messenger
27550,Coriolanus,31,4.6.74,Messenger,The nobles in great earnestness are going
27551,Coriolanus,31,4.6.75,Messenger,All to the senate-house: some news is come
27552,Coriolanus,31,4.6.76,Messenger,That turns their countenances.
27553,Coriolanus,32,4.6.77,SICINIUS,"'Tis this slave,--"
27554,Coriolanus,32,4.6.78,SICINIUS,"Go whip him, 'fore the people's eyes:--his raising,"
27555,Coriolanus,32,4.6.79,SICINIUS,Nothing but his report.
27556,Coriolanus,33,4.6.80,Messenger,"Yes, worthy sir,"
27557,Coriolanus,33,4.6.81,Messenger,"The slave's report is seconded, and more,"
27558,Coriolanus,33,4.6.82,Messenger,"More fearful, is deliver'd."
27559,Coriolanus,34,4.6.83,SICINIUS,What more fearful?
27560,Coriolanus,35,4.6.84,Messenger,It is spoke freely out of many mouths--
27561,Coriolanus,35,4.6.85,Messenger,"How probable I do not know--that Marcius,"
27562,Coriolanus,35,4.6.86,Messenger,"Join'd with Aufidius, leads a power 'gainst Rome,"
27563,Coriolanus,35,4.6.87,Messenger,And vows revenge as spacious as between
27564,Coriolanus,35,4.6.88,Messenger,The young'st and oldest thing.
27565,Coriolanus,36,4.6.89,SICINIUS,This is most likely!
27566,Coriolanus,37,4.6.90,BRUTUS,"Raised only, that the weaker sort may wish"
27567,Coriolanus,37,4.6.91,BRUTUS,Good Marcius home again.
27568,Coriolanus,38,4.6.92,SICINIUS,The very trick on't.
27569,Coriolanus,39,4.6.93,MENENIUS,This is unlikely:
27570,Coriolanus,39,4.6.94,MENENIUS,He and Aufidius can no more atone
27571,Coriolanus,39,4.6.95,MENENIUS,Than violentest contrariety.
27572,Coriolanus,39,,MENENIUS,Enter a second Messenger
27573,Coriolanus,40,4.6.96,Second Messenger,You are sent for to the senate:
27574,Coriolanus,40,4.6.97,Second Messenger,"A fearful army, led by Caius Marcius"
27575,Coriolanus,40,4.6.98,Second Messenger,"Associated with Aufidius, rages"
27576,Coriolanus,40,4.6.99,Second Messenger,"Upon our territories, and have already"
27577,Coriolanus,40,4.6.100,Second Messenger,"O'erborne their way, consumed with fire, and took"
27578,Coriolanus,40,4.6.101,Second Messenger,What lay before them.
27579,Coriolanus,40,,Second Messenger,Enter COMINIUS
27580,Coriolanus,41,4.6.102,COMINIUS,"O, you have made good work!"
27581,Coriolanus,42,4.6.103,MENENIUS,What news? what news?
27582,Coriolanus,43,4.6.104,COMINIUS,You have holp to ravish your own daughters and
27583,Coriolanus,43,4.6.105,COMINIUS,"To melt the city leads upon your pates,"
27584,Coriolanus,43,4.6.106,COMINIUS,"To see your wives dishonour'd to your noses,--"
27585,Coriolanus,44,4.6.107,MENENIUS,What's the news? what's the news?
27586,Coriolanus,45,4.6.108,COMINIUS,"Your temples burned in their cement, and"
27587,Coriolanus,45,4.6.109,COMINIUS,"Your franchises, whereon you stood, confined"
27588,Coriolanus,45,4.6.110,COMINIUS,Into an auger's bore.
27589,Coriolanus,46,4.6.111,MENENIUS,"Pray now, your news?"
27590,Coriolanus,46,4.6.112,MENENIUS,"You have made fair work, I fear me.--Pray, your news?--"
27591,Coriolanus,46,4.6.113,MENENIUS,"If Marcius should be join'd with Volscians,--"
27592,Coriolanus,47,4.6.114,COMINIUS,If!
27593,Coriolanus,47,4.6.115,COMINIUS,He is their god: he leads them like a thing
27594,Coriolanus,47,4.6.116,COMINIUS,"Made by some other deity than nature,"
27595,Coriolanus,47,4.6.117,COMINIUS,"That shapes man better, and they follow him,"
27596,Coriolanus,47,4.6.118,COMINIUS,"Against us brats, with no less confidence"
27597,Coriolanus,47,4.6.119,COMINIUS,"Than boys pursuing summer butterflies,"
27598,Coriolanus,47,4.6.120,COMINIUS,Or butchers killing flies.
27599,Coriolanus,48,4.6.121,MENENIUS,"You have made good work,"
27600,Coriolanus,48,4.6.122,MENENIUS,"You and your apron-men, you that stood so up much"
27601,Coriolanus,48,4.6.123,MENENIUS,on the voice of occupation and
27602,Coriolanus,48,4.6.124,MENENIUS,The breath of garlic-eaters!
27603,Coriolanus,49,4.6.125,COMINIUS,He will shake
27604,Coriolanus,49,4.6.126,COMINIUS,Your Rome about your ears.
27605,Coriolanus,50,4.6.127,MENENIUS,As Hercules
27606,Coriolanus,50,4.6.128,MENENIUS,Did shake down mellow fruit.
27607,Coriolanus,50,4.6.129,MENENIUS,You have made fair work!
27608,Coriolanus,51,4.6.130,BRUTUS,"But is this true, sir?"
27609,Coriolanus,52,4.6.131,COMINIUS,"Ay, and you'll look pale"
27610,Coriolanus,52,4.6.132,COMINIUS,Before you find it other. All the regions
27611,Coriolanus,52,4.6.133,COMINIUS,"Do smilingly revolt, and who resist"
27612,Coriolanus,52,4.6.134,COMINIUS,"Are mock'd for valiant ignorance,"
27613,Coriolanus,52,4.6.135,COMINIUS,And perish constant fools. Who is't can blame him?
27614,Coriolanus,52,4.6.136,COMINIUS,Your enemies and his find something in him.
27615,Coriolanus,53,4.6.137,MENENIUS,"We are all undone, unless"
27616,Coriolanus,53,4.6.138,MENENIUS,The noble man have mercy.
27617,Coriolanus,54,4.6.139,COMINIUS,Who shall ask it?
27618,Coriolanus,54,4.6.140,COMINIUS,"The tribunes cannot do't for shame, the people"
27619,Coriolanus,54,4.6.141,COMINIUS,Deserve such pity of him as the wolf
27620,Coriolanus,54,4.6.142,COMINIUS,"Does of the shepherds: for his best friends, if they"
27621,Coriolanus,54,4.6.143,COMINIUS,"Should say 'Be good to Rome,' they charged him even"
27622,Coriolanus,54,4.6.144,COMINIUS,"As those should do that had deserved his hate,"
27623,Coriolanus,54,4.6.145,COMINIUS,And therein show'd like enemies.
27624,Coriolanus,55,4.6.146,MENENIUS,'Tis true:
27625,Coriolanus,55,4.6.147,MENENIUS,If he were putting to my house the brand
27626,Coriolanus,55,4.6.148,MENENIUS,"That should consume it, I have not the face"
27627,Coriolanus,55,4.6.149,MENENIUS,"To say 'Beseech you, cease.' You have made fair hands,"
27628,Coriolanus,55,4.6.150,MENENIUS,You and your crafts! you have crafted fair!
27629,Coriolanus,56,4.6.151,COMINIUS,You have brought
27630,Coriolanus,56,4.6.152,COMINIUS,"A trembling upon Rome, such as was never"
27631,Coriolanus,56,4.6.153,COMINIUS,So incapable of help.
27632,Coriolanus,57,4.6.154,Both Tribunes,Say not we brought it.
27633,Coriolanus,58,4.6.155,MENENIUS,"How! Was it we? we loved him but, like beasts"
27634,Coriolanus,58,4.6.156,MENENIUS,"And cowardly nobles, gave way unto your clusters,"
27635,Coriolanus,58,4.6.157,MENENIUS,Who did hoot him out o' the city.
27636,Coriolanus,59,4.6.158,COMINIUS,But I fear
27637,Coriolanus,59,4.6.159,COMINIUS,"They'll roar him in again. Tullus Aufidius,"
27638,Coriolanus,59,4.6.160,COMINIUS,"The second name of men, obeys his points"
27639,Coriolanus,59,4.6.161,COMINIUS,As if he were his officer: desperation
27640,Coriolanus,59,4.6.162,COMINIUS,"Is all the policy, strength and defence,"
27641,Coriolanus,59,4.6.163,COMINIUS,That Rome can make against them.
27642,Coriolanus,59,,COMINIUS,Enter a troop of Citizens
27643,Coriolanus,60,4.6.164,MENENIUS,Here come the clusters.
27644,Coriolanus,60,4.6.165,MENENIUS,And is Aufidius with him? You are they
27645,Coriolanus,60,4.6.166,MENENIUS,"That made the air unwholesome, when you cast"
27646,Coriolanus,60,4.6.167,MENENIUS,Your stinking greasy caps in hooting at
27647,Coriolanus,60,4.6.168,MENENIUS,"Coriolanus' exile. Now he's coming,"
27648,Coriolanus,60,4.6.169,MENENIUS,And not a hair upon a soldier's head
27649,Coriolanus,60,4.6.170,MENENIUS,Which will not prove a whip: as many coxcombs
27650,Coriolanus,60,4.6.171,MENENIUS,"As you threw caps up will he tumble down,"
27651,Coriolanus,60,4.6.172,MENENIUS,"And pay you for your voices. 'Tis no matter,"
27652,Coriolanus,60,4.6.173,MENENIUS,"if he could burn us all into one coal,"
27653,Coriolanus,60,4.6.174,MENENIUS,We have deserved it.
27654,Coriolanus,61,4.6.175,Citizens,"Faith, we hear fearful news."
27655,Coriolanus,62,4.6.176,First Citizen,"For mine own part,"
27656,Coriolanus,62,4.6.177,First Citizen,"When I said, banish him, I said 'twas pity."
27657,Coriolanus,63,4.6.178,Second Citizen,And so did I.
27658,Coriolanus,64,4.6.179,Third Citizen,"And so did I, and, to say the truth, so did very"
27659,Coriolanus,64,4.6.180,Third Citizen,"many of us: that we did, we did for the best, and"
27660,Coriolanus,64,4.6.181,Third Citizen,"though we willingly consented to his banishment, yet"
27661,Coriolanus,64,4.6.182,Third Citizen,it was against our will.
27662,Coriolanus,65,4.6.183,COMINIUS,"Ye re goodly things, you voices!"
27663,Coriolanus,66,4.6.184,MENENIUS,You have made
27664,Coriolanus,66,4.6.185,MENENIUS,"Good work, you and your cry! Shall's to the Capitol?"
27665,Coriolanus,67,4.6.186,COMINIUS,"O, ay, what else?"
27666,Coriolanus,67,,COMINIUS,Exeunt COMINIUS and MENENIUS
27667,Coriolanus,68,4.6.187,SICINIUS,"Go, masters, get you home, be not dismay'd:"
27668,Coriolanus,68,4.6.188,SICINIUS,These are a side that would be glad to have
27669,Coriolanus,68,4.6.189,SICINIUS,"This true which they so seem to fear. Go home,"
27670,Coriolanus,68,4.6.190,SICINIUS,And show no sign of fear.
27671,Coriolanus,69,4.6.191,First Citizen,"The gods be good to us! Come, masters, let's home."
27672,Coriolanus,69,4.6.192,First Citizen,I ever said we were i' the wrong when we banished
27673,Coriolanus,69,4.6.193,First Citizen,him.
27674,Coriolanus,70,4.6.194,Second Citizen,"So did we all. But, come, let's home."
27675,Coriolanus,70,,Second Citizen,Exeunt Citizens
27676,Coriolanus,71,4.6.195,BRUTUS,I do not like this news.
27677,Coriolanus,72,4.6.196,SICINIUS,Nor I.
27678,Coriolanus,73,4.6.197,BRUTUS,Let's to the Capitol. Would half my wealth
27679,Coriolanus,73,4.6.198,BRUTUS,Would buy this for a lie!
27680,Coriolanus,74,4.6.199,SICINIUS,"Pray, let us go."
27681,Coriolanus,74,,SICINIUS,Exeunt
27682,Coriolanus,74,,SICINIUS,"SCENE VII. A camp, at a small distance from Rome."
27683,Coriolanus,74,,SICINIUS,Enter AUFIDIUS and his Lieutenant
27684,Coriolanus,1,4.7.1,AUFIDIUS,Do they still fly to the Roman?
27685,Coriolanus,2,4.7.2,Lieutenant,"I do not know what witchcraft's in him, but"
27686,Coriolanus,2,4.7.3,Lieutenant,"Your soldiers use him as the grace 'fore meat,"
27687,Coriolanus,2,4.7.4,Lieutenant,"Their talk at table, and their thanks at end,"
27688,Coriolanus,2,4.7.5,Lieutenant,"And you are darken'd in this action, sir,"
27689,Coriolanus,2,4.7.6,Lieutenant,Even by your own.
27690,Coriolanus,3,4.7.7,AUFIDIUS,"I cannot help it now,"
27691,Coriolanus,3,4.7.8,AUFIDIUS,"Unless, by using means, I lame the foot"
27692,Coriolanus,3,4.7.9,AUFIDIUS,"Of our design. He bears himself more proudlier,"
27693,Coriolanus,3,4.7.10,AUFIDIUS,"Even to my person, than I thought he would"
27694,Coriolanus,3,4.7.11,AUFIDIUS,When first I did embrace him: yet his nature
27695,Coriolanus,3,4.7.12,AUFIDIUS,"In that's no changeling, and I must excuse"
27696,Coriolanus,3,4.7.13,AUFIDIUS,What cannot be amended.
27697,Coriolanus,4,4.7.14,Lieutenant,"Yet I wish, sir,--"
27698,Coriolanus,4,4.7.15,Lieutenant,"I mean for your particular,--you had not"
27699,Coriolanus,4,4.7.16,Lieutenant,"Join'd in commission with him, but either"
27700,Coriolanus,4,4.7.17,Lieutenant,"Had borne the action of yourself, or else"
27701,Coriolanus,4,4.7.18,Lieutenant,To him had left it solely.
27702,Coriolanus,5,4.7.19,AUFIDIUS,"I understand thee well, and be thou sure,"
27703,Coriolanus,5,4.7.20,AUFIDIUS,"when he shall come to his account, he knows not"
27704,Coriolanus,5,4.7.21,AUFIDIUS,"What I can urge against him. Although it seems,"
27705,Coriolanus,5,4.7.22,AUFIDIUS,"And so he thinks, and is no less apparent"
27706,Coriolanus,5,4.7.23,AUFIDIUS,"To the vulgar eye, that he bears all things fairly."
27707,Coriolanus,5,4.7.24,AUFIDIUS,"And shows good husbandry for the Volscian state,"
27708,Coriolanus,5,4.7.25,AUFIDIUS,"Fights dragon-like, and does achieve as soon"
27709,Coriolanus,5,4.7.26,AUFIDIUS,"As draw his sword, yet he hath left undone"
27710,Coriolanus,5,4.7.27,AUFIDIUS,"That which shall break his neck or hazard mine,"
27711,Coriolanus,5,4.7.28,AUFIDIUS,Whene'er we come to our account.
27712,Coriolanus,6,4.7.29,Lieutenant,"Sir, I beseech you, think you he'll carry Rome?"
27713,Coriolanus,7,4.7.30,AUFIDIUS,"All places yield to him ere he sits down,"
27714,Coriolanus,7,4.7.31,AUFIDIUS,And the nobility of Rome are his:
27715,Coriolanus,7,4.7.32,AUFIDIUS,The senators and patricians love him too:
27716,Coriolanus,7,4.7.33,AUFIDIUS,"The tribunes are no soldiers, and their people"
27717,Coriolanus,7,4.7.34,AUFIDIUS,"Will be as rash in the repeal, as hasty"
27718,Coriolanus,7,4.7.35,AUFIDIUS,To expel him thence. I think he'll be to Rome
27719,Coriolanus,7,4.7.36,AUFIDIUS,"As is the osprey to the fish, who takes it"
27720,Coriolanus,7,4.7.37,AUFIDIUS,By sovereignty of nature. First he was
27721,Coriolanus,7,4.7.38,AUFIDIUS,"A noble servant to them, but he could not"
27722,Coriolanus,7,4.7.39,AUFIDIUS,"Carry his honours even: whether 'twas pride,"
27723,Coriolanus,7,4.7.40,AUFIDIUS,Which out of daily fortune ever taints
27724,Coriolanus,7,4.7.41,AUFIDIUS,"The happy man, whether defect of judgment,"
27725,Coriolanus,7,4.7.42,AUFIDIUS,To fail in the disposing of those chances
27726,Coriolanus,7,4.7.43,AUFIDIUS,"Which he was lord of, or whether nature,"
27727,Coriolanus,7,4.7.44,AUFIDIUS,"Not to be other than one thing, not moving"
27728,Coriolanus,7,4.7.45,AUFIDIUS,"From the casque to the cushion, but commanding peace"
27729,Coriolanus,7,4.7.46,AUFIDIUS,Even with the same austerity and garb
27730,Coriolanus,7,4.7.47,AUFIDIUS,"As he controll'd the war, but one of these--"
27731,Coriolanus,7,4.7.48,AUFIDIUS,"As he hath spices of them all, not all,"
27732,Coriolanus,7,4.7.49,AUFIDIUS,"For I dare so far free him--made him fear'd,"
27733,Coriolanus,7,4.7.50,AUFIDIUS,"So hated, and so banish'd: but he has a merit,"
27734,Coriolanus,7,4.7.51,AUFIDIUS,To choke it in the utterance. So our virtues
27735,Coriolanus,7,4.7.52,AUFIDIUS,Lie in the interpretation of the time:
27736,Coriolanus,7,4.7.53,AUFIDIUS,"And power, unto itself most commendable,"
27737,Coriolanus,7,4.7.54,AUFIDIUS,Hath not a tomb so evident as a chair
27738,Coriolanus,7,4.7.55,AUFIDIUS,To extol what it hath done.
27739,Coriolanus,7,4.7.56,AUFIDIUS,"One fire drives out one fire, one nail, one nail,"
27740,Coriolanus,7,4.7.57,AUFIDIUS,"Rights by rights falter, strengths by strengths do fail."
27741,Coriolanus,7,4.7.58,AUFIDIUS,"Come, let's away. When, Caius, Rome is thine,"
27742,Coriolanus,7,4.7.59,AUFIDIUS,"Thou art poor'st of all, then shortly art thou mine."
27743,Coriolanus,7,,AUFIDIUS,Exeunt
27744,Coriolanus,7,,AUFIDIUS,ACT V
27745,Coriolanus,7,,AUFIDIUS,SCENE I. Rome. A public place.
27746,Coriolanus,7,,AUFIDIUS,"Enter MENENIUS, COMINIUS, SICINIUS, BRUTUS, and others"
27747,Coriolanus,1,5.1.1,MENENIUS,"No, I'll not go: you hear what he hath said"
27748,Coriolanus,1,5.1.2,MENENIUS,"Which was sometime his general, who loved him"
27749,Coriolanus,1,5.1.3,MENENIUS,In a most dear particular. He call'd me father:
27750,Coriolanus,1,5.1.4,MENENIUS,"But what o' that? Go, you that banish'd him,"
27751,Coriolanus,1,5.1.5,MENENIUS,"A mile before his tent fall down, and knee"
27752,Coriolanus,1,5.1.6,MENENIUS,"The way into his mercy: nay, if he coy'd"
27753,Coriolanus,1,5.1.7,MENENIUS,"To hear Cominius speak, I'll keep at home."
27754,Coriolanus,2,5.1.8,COMINIUS,He would not seem to know me.
27755,Coriolanus,3,5.1.9,MENENIUS,Do you hear?
27756,Coriolanus,4,5.1.10,COMINIUS,Yet one time he did call me by my name:
27757,Coriolanus,4,5.1.11,COMINIUS,"I urged our old acquaintance, and the drops"
27758,Coriolanus,4,5.1.12,COMINIUS,That we have bled together. Coriolanus
27759,Coriolanus,4,5.1.13,COMINIUS,"He would not answer to: forbad all names,"
27760,Coriolanus,4,5.1.14,COMINIUS,"He was a kind of nothing, titleless,"
27761,Coriolanus,4,5.1.15,COMINIUS,Till he had forged himself a name o' the fire
27762,Coriolanus,4,5.1.16,COMINIUS,Of burning Rome.
27763,Coriolanus,5,5.1.17,MENENIUS,"Why, so: you have made good work!"
27764,Coriolanus,5,5.1.18,MENENIUS,"A pair of tribunes that have rack'd for Rome,"
27765,Coriolanus,5,5.1.19,MENENIUS,"To make coals cheap,--a noble memory!"
27766,Coriolanus,6,5.1.20,COMINIUS,I minded him how royal 'twas to pardon
27767,Coriolanus,6,5.1.21,COMINIUS,"When it was less expected: he replied,"
27768,Coriolanus,6,5.1.22,COMINIUS,It was a bare petition of a state
27769,Coriolanus,6,5.1.23,COMINIUS,To one whom they had punish'd.
27770,Coriolanus,7,5.1.24,MENENIUS,Very well:
27771,Coriolanus,7,5.1.25,MENENIUS,Could he say less?
27772,Coriolanus,8,5.1.26,COMINIUS,I offer'd to awaken his regard
27773,Coriolanus,8,5.1.27,COMINIUS,"For's private friends: his answer to me was,"
27774,Coriolanus,8,5.1.28,COMINIUS,He could not stay to pick them in a pile
27775,Coriolanus,8,5.1.29,COMINIUS,"Of noisome musty chaff: he said 'twas folly,"
27776,Coriolanus,8,5.1.30,COMINIUS,"For one poor grain or two, to leave unburnt,"
27777,Coriolanus,8,5.1.31,COMINIUS,And still to nose the offence.
27778,Coriolanus,9,5.1.32,MENENIUS,For one poor grain or two!
27779,Coriolanus,9,5.1.33,MENENIUS,"I am one of those, his mother, wife, his child,"
27780,Coriolanus,9,5.1.34,MENENIUS,"And this brave fellow too, we are the grains:"
27781,Coriolanus,9,5.1.35,MENENIUS,"You are the musty chaff, and you are smelt"
27782,Coriolanus,9,5.1.36,MENENIUS,Above the moon: we must be burnt for you.
27783,Coriolanus,10,5.1.37,SICINIUS,"Nay, pray, be patient: if you refuse your aid"
27784,Coriolanus,10,5.1.38,SICINIUS,"In this so never-needed help, yet do not"
27785,Coriolanus,10,5.1.39,SICINIUS,"Upbraid's with our distress. But, sure, if you"
27786,Coriolanus,10,5.1.40,SICINIUS,"Would be your country's pleader, your good tongue,"
27787,Coriolanus,10,5.1.41,SICINIUS,"More than the instant army we can make,"
27788,Coriolanus,10,5.1.42,SICINIUS,Might stop our countryman.
27789,Coriolanus,11,5.1.43,MENENIUS,"No, I'll not meddle."
27790,Coriolanus,12,5.1.44,SICINIUS,"Pray you, go to him."
27791,Coriolanus,13,5.1.45,MENENIUS,What should I do?
27792,Coriolanus,14,5.1.46,BRUTUS,Only make trial what your love can do
27793,Coriolanus,14,5.1.47,BRUTUS,"For Rome, towards Marcius."
27794,Coriolanus,15,5.1.48,MENENIUS,"Well, and say that Marcius"
27795,Coriolanus,15,5.1.49,MENENIUS,"Return me, as Cominius is return'd,"
27796,Coriolanus,15,5.1.50,MENENIUS,"Unheard, what then?"
27797,Coriolanus,15,5.1.51,MENENIUS,"But as a discontented friend, grief-shot"
27798,Coriolanus,15,5.1.52,MENENIUS,With his unkindness? say't be so?
27799,Coriolanus,16,5.1.53,SICINIUS,Yet your good will
27800,Coriolanus,16,5.1.54,SICINIUS,"must have that thanks from Rome, after the measure"
27801,Coriolanus,16,5.1.55,SICINIUS,As you intended well.
27802,Coriolanus,17,5.1.56,MENENIUS,I'll undertake 't:
27803,Coriolanus,17,5.1.57,MENENIUS,"I think he'll hear me. Yet, to bite his lip"
27804,Coriolanus,17,5.1.58,MENENIUS,"And hum at good Cominius, much unhearts me."
27805,Coriolanus,17,5.1.59,MENENIUS,"He was not taken well, he had not dined:"
27806,Coriolanus,17,5.1.60,MENENIUS,"The veins unfill'd, our blood is cold, and then"
27807,Coriolanus,17,5.1.61,MENENIUS,"We pout upon the morning, are unapt"
27808,Coriolanus,17,5.1.62,MENENIUS,"To give or to forgive, but when we have stuff'd"
27809,Coriolanus,17,5.1.63,MENENIUS,These and these conveyances of our blood
27810,Coriolanus,17,5.1.64,MENENIUS,"With wine and feeding, we have suppler souls"
27811,Coriolanus,17,5.1.65,MENENIUS,Than in our priest-like fasts: therefore I'll watch him
27812,Coriolanus,17,5.1.66,MENENIUS,"Till he be dieted to my request,"
27813,Coriolanus,17,5.1.67,MENENIUS,And then I'll set upon him.
27814,Coriolanus,18,5.1.68,BRUTUS,"You know the very road into his kindness,"
27815,Coriolanus,18,5.1.69,BRUTUS,And cannot lose your way.
27816,Coriolanus,19,5.1.70,MENENIUS,"Good faith, I'll prove him,"
27817,Coriolanus,19,5.1.71,MENENIUS,Speed how it will. I shall ere long have knowledge
27818,Coriolanus,19,5.1.72,MENENIUS,Of my success.
27819,Coriolanus,19,,MENENIUS,Exit
27820,Coriolanus,20,5.1.73,COMINIUS,He'll never hear him.
27821,Coriolanus,21,5.1.74,SICINIUS,Not?
27822,Coriolanus,22,5.1.75,COMINIUS,"I tell you, he does sit in gold, his eye"
27823,Coriolanus,22,5.1.76,COMINIUS,"Red as 'twould burn Rome, and his injury"
27824,Coriolanus,22,5.1.77,COMINIUS,"The gaoler to his pity. I kneel'd before him,"
27825,Coriolanus,22,5.1.78,COMINIUS,"'Twas very faintly he said 'Rise,' dismiss'd me"
27826,Coriolanus,22,5.1.79,COMINIUS,"Thus, with his speechless hand: what he would do,"
27827,Coriolanus,22,5.1.80,COMINIUS,"He sent in writing after me, what he would not,"
27828,Coriolanus,22,5.1.81,COMINIUS,Bound with an oath to yield to his conditions:
27829,Coriolanus,22,5.1.82,COMINIUS,So that all hope is vain.
27830,Coriolanus,22,5.1.83,COMINIUS,"Unless his noble mother, and his wife,"
27831,Coriolanus,22,5.1.84,COMINIUS,"Who, as I hear, mean to solicit him"
27832,Coriolanus,22,5.1.85,COMINIUS,"For mercy to his country. Therefore, let's hence,"
27833,Coriolanus,22,5.1.86,COMINIUS,And with our fair entreaties haste them on.
27834,Coriolanus,22,,COMINIUS,Exeunt
27835,Coriolanus,22,,COMINIUS,SCENE II. Entrance of the Volscian camp before Rome.
27836,Coriolanus,22,5.2.1,COMINIUS,Two Sentinels on guard.
27837,Coriolanus,22,,COMINIUS,"Enter to them, MENENIUS"
27838,Coriolanus,1,5.2.2,First Senator,Stay: whence are you?
27839,Coriolanus,2,5.2.3,Second Senator,"Stand, and go back."
27840,Coriolanus,3,5.2.4,MENENIUS,"You guard like men, 'tis well: but, by your leave,"
27841,Coriolanus,3,5.2.5,MENENIUS,"I am an officer of state, and come"
27842,Coriolanus,3,5.2.6,MENENIUS,To speak with Coriolanus.
27843,Coriolanus,4,5.2.7,First Senator,From whence?
27844,Coriolanus,5,5.2.8,MENENIUS,From Rome.
27845,Coriolanus,6,5.2.9,First Senator,"You may not pass, you must return: our general"
27846,Coriolanus,6,5.2.10,First Senator,Will no more hear from thence.
27847,Coriolanus,7,5.2.11,Second Senator,You'll see your Rome embraced with fire before
27848,Coriolanus,7,5.2.12,Second Senator,You'll speak with Coriolanus.
27849,Coriolanus,8,5.2.13,MENENIUS,"Good my friends,"
27850,Coriolanus,8,5.2.14,MENENIUS,"If you have heard your general talk of Rome,"
27851,Coriolanus,8,5.2.15,MENENIUS,"And of his friends there, it is lots to blanks,"
27852,Coriolanus,8,5.2.16,MENENIUS,My name hath touch'd your ears it is Menenius.
27853,Coriolanus,9,5.2.17,First Senator,"Be it so, go back: the virtue of your name"
27854,Coriolanus,9,5.2.18,First Senator,Is not here passable.
27855,Coriolanus,10,5.2.19,MENENIUS,"I tell thee, fellow,"
27856,Coriolanus,10,5.2.20,MENENIUS,The general is my lover: I have been
27857,Coriolanus,10,5.2.21,MENENIUS,"The book of his good acts, whence men have read"
27858,Coriolanus,10,5.2.22,MENENIUS,"His name unparallel'd, haply amplified,"
27859,Coriolanus,10,5.2.23,MENENIUS,"For I have ever verified my friends,"
27860,Coriolanus,10,5.2.24,MENENIUS,"Of whom he's chief, with all the size that verity"
27861,Coriolanus,10,5.2.25,MENENIUS,"Would without lapsing suffer: nay, sometimes,"
27862,Coriolanus,10,5.2.26,MENENIUS,"Like to a bowl upon a subtle ground,"
27863,Coriolanus,10,5.2.27,MENENIUS,"I have tumbled past the throw, and in his praise"
27864,Coriolanus,10,5.2.28,MENENIUS,"Have almost stamp'd the leasing: therefore, fellow,"
27865,Coriolanus,10,5.2.29,MENENIUS,I must have leave to pass.
27866,Coriolanus,11,5.2.30,First Senator,"Faith, sir, if you had told as many lies in his"
27867,Coriolanus,11,5.2.31,First Senator,"behalf as you have uttered words in your own, you"
27868,Coriolanus,11,5.2.32,First Senator,"should not pass here, no, though it were as virtuous"
27869,Coriolanus,11,5.2.33,First Senator,"to lie as to live chastely. Therefore, go back."
27870,Coriolanus,12,5.2.34,MENENIUS,"Prithee, fellow, remember my name is Menenius,"
27871,Coriolanus,12,5.2.35,MENENIUS,always factionary on the party of your general.
27872,Coriolanus,13,5.2.36,Second Senator,"Howsoever you have been his liar, as you say you"
27873,Coriolanus,13,5.2.37,Second Senator,"have, I am one that, telling true under him, must"
27874,Coriolanus,13,5.2.38,Second Senator,"say, you cannot pass. Therefore, go back."
27875,Coriolanus,14,5.2.39,MENENIUS,"Has he dined, canst thou tell? for I would not"
27876,Coriolanus,14,5.2.40,MENENIUS,speak with him till after dinner.
27877,Coriolanus,15,5.2.41,First Senator,"You are a Roman, are you?"
27878,Coriolanus,16,5.2.42,MENENIUS,"I am, as thy general is."
27879,Coriolanus,17,5.2.43,First Senator,"Then you should hate Rome, as he does. Can you,"
27880,Coriolanus,17,5.2.44,First Senator,when you have pushed out your gates the very

27886,Coriolanus,17,5.2.50,First Senator,you seem to be? Can you think to blow out the

27888,Coriolanus,17,5.2.52,First Senator,"such weak breath as this? No, you are deceived,"

27893,Coriolanus,18,5.2.57,MENENIUS,use me with estimation.
27894,Coriolanus,19,5.2.58,Second Senator,"Come, my captain knows you not."
27895,Coriolanus,20,5.2.59,MENENIUS,"I mean, thy general."
27896,Coriolanus,21,5.2.60,First Senator,"My general cares not for you. Back, I say, go, lest"
27897,Coriolanus,21,5.2.61,First Senator,"I let forth your half-pint of blood, back,--that's"
27898,Coriolanus,21,5.2.62,First Senator,the utmost of your having: back.

27900,Coriolanus,22,,MENENIUS,Enter CORIOLANUS and AUFIDIUS
27901,Coriolanus,23,5.2.64,CORIOLANUS,What's the matter?
27902,Coriolanus,24,5.2.65,MENENIUS,"Now, you companion, I'll say an errand for you:"
27903,Coriolanus,24,5.2.66,MENENIUS,"You shall know now that I am in estimation, you shall"
27904,Coriolanus,24,5.2.67,MENENIUS,perceive that a Jack guardant cannot office me from
27905,Coriolanus,24,5.2.68,MENENIUS,"my son Coriolanus: guess, but by my entertainment"
27906,Coriolanus,24,5.2.69,MENENIUS,"with him, if thou standest not i' the state of"

27909,Coriolanus,24,5.2.72,MENENIUS,"presently, and swoon for what's to come upon thee."
27910,Coriolanus,24,,MENENIUS,To CORIOLANUS
27911,Coriolanus,24,5.2.73,MENENIUS,The glorious gods sit in hourly synod about thy
27912,Coriolanus,24,5.2.74,MENENIUS,"particular prosperity, and love thee no worse than"
27913,Coriolanus,24,5.2.75,MENENIUS,"thy old father Menenius does! O my son, my son!"
27914,Coriolanus,24,5.2.76,MENENIUS,"thou art preparing fire for us, look thee, here's"
27915,Coriolanus,24,5.2.77,MENENIUS,water to quench it. I was hardly moved to come to

27923,Coriolanus,25,5.2.85,CORIOLANUS,Away!
27924,Coriolanus,26,5.2.86,MENENIUS,How! away!
27925,Coriolanus,27,5.2.87,CORIOLANUS,"Wife, mother, child, I know not. My affairs"
27926,Coriolanus,27,5.2.88,CORIOLANUS,Are servanted to others: though I owe
27927,Coriolanus,27,5.2.89,CORIOLANUS,"My revenge properly, my remission lies"
27928,Coriolanus,27,5.2.90,CORIOLANUS,"In Volscian breasts. That we have been familiar,"
27929,Coriolanus,27,5.2.91,CORIOLANUS,"Ingrate forgetfulness shall poison, rather"
27930,Coriolanus,27,5.2.92,CORIOLANUS,"Than pity note how much. Therefore, be gone."
27931,Coriolanus,27,5.2.93,CORIOLANUS,Mine ears against your suits are stronger than
27932,Coriolanus,27,5.2.94,CORIOLANUS,"Your gates against my force. Yet, for I loved thee,"
27933,Coriolanus,27,5.2.95,CORIOLANUS,"Take this along, I writ it for thy sake"
27934,Coriolanus,27,,CORIOLANUS,Gives a letter
27935,Coriolanus,27,5.2.96,CORIOLANUS,"And would have rent it. Another word, Menenius,"
27936,Coriolanus,27,5.2.97,CORIOLANUS,"I will not hear thee speak. This man, Aufidius,"
27937,Coriolanus,27,5.2.98,CORIOLANUS,Was my beloved in Rome: yet thou behold'st!
27938,Coriolanus,28,5.2.99,AUFIDIUS,You keep a constant temper.
27939,Coriolanus,28,,AUFIDIUS,Exeunt CORIOLANUS and AUFIDIUS
27940,Coriolanus,29,5.2.100,First Senator,"Now, sir, is your name Menenius?"
27941,Coriolanus,30,5.2.101,Second Senator,"'Tis a spell, you see, of much  power: you know the"
27942,Coriolanus,30,5.2.102,Second Senator,way home again.
27943,Coriolanus,31,5.2.103,First Senator,Do you hear how we are shent for keeping your
27944,Coriolanus,31,5.2.104,First Senator,greatness back?
27945,Coriolanus,32,5.2.105,Second Senator,"What cause, do you think, I have to swoon?"
27946,Coriolanus,33,5.2.106,MENENIUS,I neither care for the world nor your general: for
27947,Coriolanus,33,5.2.107,MENENIUS,"such things as you, I can scarce think there's any,"
27948,Coriolanus,33,5.2.108,MENENIUS,ye're so slight. He that hath a will to die by
27949,Coriolanus,33,5.2.109,MENENIUS,himself fears it not from another: let your general
27950,Coriolanus,33,5.2.110,MENENIUS,"do his worst. For you, be that you are, long, and"
27951,Coriolanus,33,5.2.111,MENENIUS,"your misery increase with your age! I say to you,"
27952,Coriolanus,33,5.2.112,MENENIUS,"as I was said to, Away!"
27953,Coriolanus,33,,MENENIUS,Exit
27954,Coriolanus,34,5.2.113,First Senator,"A noble fellow, I warrant him."
27955,Coriolanus,35,5.2.114,Second Senator,"The worthy fellow is our general: he's the rock, the"

27959,Coriolanus,35,,Second Senator,"Enter CORIOLANUS, AUFIDIUS, and others"
27960,Coriolanus,1,5.3.1,CORIOLANUS,We will before the walls of Rome tomorrow
27961,Coriolanus,1,5.3.2,CORIOLANUS,"Set down our host. My partner in this action,"
27962,Coriolanus,1,5.3.3,CORIOLANUS,"You must report to the Volscian lords, how plainly"
27963,Coriolanus,1,5.3.4,CORIOLANUS,I have borne this business.
27964,Coriolanus,2,5.3.5,AUFIDIUS,Only their ends
27965,Coriolanus,2,5.3.6,AUFIDIUS,"You have respected, stopp'd your ears against"
27966,Coriolanus,2,5.3.7,AUFIDIUS,"The general suit of Rome, never admitted"
27967,Coriolanus,2,5.3.8,AUFIDIUS,"A private whisper, no, not with such friends"
27968,Coriolanus,2,5.3.9,AUFIDIUS,That thought them sure of you.
27969,Coriolanus,3,5.3.10,CORIOLANUS,"This last old man,"
27970,Coriolanus,3,5.3.11,CORIOLANUS,"Whom with a crack'd heart I have sent to Rome,"
27971,Coriolanus,3,5.3.12,CORIOLANUS,"Loved me above the measure of a father,"
27972,Coriolanus,3,5.3.13,CORIOLANUS,"Nay, godded me, indeed. Their latest refuge"
27973,Coriolanus,3,5.3.14,CORIOLANUS,"Was to send him, for whose old love I have,"
27974,Coriolanus,3,5.3.15,CORIOLANUS,"Though I show'd sourly to him, once more offer'd"
27975,Coriolanus,3,5.3.16,CORIOLANUS,"The first conditions, which they did refuse"
27976,Coriolanus,3,5.3.17,CORIOLANUS,"And cannot now accept, to grace him only"
27977,Coriolanus,3,5.3.18,CORIOLANUS,"That thought he could do more, a very little"
27978,Coriolanus,3,5.3.19,CORIOLANUS,"I have yielded to: fresh embassies and suits,"
27979,Coriolanus,3,5.3.20,CORIOLANUS,"Nor from the state nor private friends, hereafter"
27980,Coriolanus,3,5.3.21,CORIOLANUS,Will I lend ear to. Ha! what shout is this?
27981,Coriolanus,3,,CORIOLANUS,Shout within
27982,Coriolanus,3,5.3.22,CORIOLANUS,Shall I be tempted to infringe my vow
27983,Coriolanus,3,5.3.23,CORIOLANUS,In the same time 'tis made? I will not.
27984,Coriolanus,3,,CORIOLANUS,"Enter in mourning habits, VIRGILIA, VOLUMNIA, leading young MARCIUS, VALERIA, and Attendants"
27985,Coriolanus,3,5.3.24,CORIOLANUS,"My wife comes foremost, then the honour'd mould"
27986,Coriolanus,3,5.3.25,CORIOLANUS,"Wherein this trunk was framed, and in her hand"
27987,Coriolanus,3,5.3.26,CORIOLANUS,"The grandchild to her blood. But, out, affection!"
27988,Coriolanus,3,5.3.27,CORIOLANUS,"All bond and privilege of nature, break!"
27989,Coriolanus,3,5.3.28,CORIOLANUS,Let it be virtuous to be obstinate.
27990,Coriolanus,3,5.3.29,CORIOLANUS,"What is that curt'sy worth? or those doves' eyes,"
27991,Coriolanus,3,5.3.30,CORIOLANUS,"Which can make gods forsworn? I melt, and am not"
27992,Coriolanus,3,5.3.31,CORIOLANUS,"Of stronger earth than others. My mother bows,"
27993,Coriolanus,3,5.3.32,CORIOLANUS,As if Olympus to a molehill should
27994,Coriolanus,3,5.3.33,CORIOLANUS,In supplication nod: and my young boy
27995,Coriolanus,3,5.3.34,CORIOLANUS,"Hath an aspect of intercession, which"
27996,Coriolanus,3,5.3.35,CORIOLANUS,Great nature cries 'Deny not.' let the Volsces
27997,Coriolanus,3,5.3.36,CORIOLANUS,Plough Rome and harrow Italy: I'll never
27998,Coriolanus,3,5.3.37,CORIOLANUS,"Be such a gosling to obey instinct, but stand,"
27999,Coriolanus,3,5.3.38,CORIOLANUS,As if a man were author of himself
28000,Coriolanus,3,5.3.39,CORIOLANUS,And knew no other kin.
28001,Coriolanus,4,5.3.40,VIRGILIA,My lord and husband!
28002,Coriolanus,5,5.3.41,CORIOLANUS,These eyes are not the same I wore in Rome.
28003,Coriolanus,6,5.3.42,VIRGILIA,The sorrow that delivers us thus changed
28004,Coriolanus,6,5.3.43,VIRGILIA,Makes you think so.
28005,Coriolanus,7,5.3.44,CORIOLANUS,"Like a dull actor now,"
28006,Coriolanus,7,5.3.45,CORIOLANUS,"I have forgot my part, and I am out,"
28007,Coriolanus,7,5.3.46,CORIOLANUS,"Even to a full disgrace. Best of my flesh,"
28008,Coriolanus,7,5.3.47,CORIOLANUS,"Forgive my tyranny, but do not say"
28009,Coriolanus,7,5.3.48,CORIOLANUS,"For that 'Forgive our Romans.' O, a kiss"
28010,Coriolanus,7,5.3.49,CORIOLANUS,"Long as my exile, sweet as my revenge!"
28011,Coriolanus,7,5.3.50,CORIOLANUS,"Now, by the jealous queen of heaven, that kiss"
28012,Coriolanus,7,5.3.51,CORIOLANUS,"I carried from thee, dear, and my true lip"
28013,Coriolanus,7,5.3.52,CORIOLANUS,"Hath virgin'd it e'er since. You gods! I prate,"
28014,Coriolanus,7,5.3.53,CORIOLANUS,And the most noble mother of the world
28015,Coriolanus,7,5.3.54,CORIOLANUS,"Leave unsaluted: sink, my knee, i' the earth,"
28016,Coriolanus,7,,CORIOLANUS,Kneels
28017,Coriolanus,7,5.3.55,CORIOLANUS,Of thy deep duty more impression show
28018,Coriolanus,7,5.3.56,CORIOLANUS,Than that of common sons.
28019,Coriolanus,8,5.3.57,VOLUMNIA,"O, stand up blest!"
28020,Coriolanus,8,5.3.58,VOLUMNIA,"Whilst, with no softer cushion than the flint,"
28021,Coriolanus,8,5.3.59,VOLUMNIA,"I kneel before thee, and unproperly"
28022,Coriolanus,8,5.3.60,VOLUMNIA,"Show duty, as mistaken all this while"
28023,Coriolanus,8,5.3.61,VOLUMNIA,Between the child and parent.
28024,Coriolanus,8,,VOLUMNIA,Kneels
28025,Coriolanus,9,5.3.62,CORIOLANUS,What is this?
28026,Coriolanus,9,5.3.63,CORIOLANUS,Your knees to me? to your corrected son?
28027,Coriolanus,9,5.3.64,CORIOLANUS,Then let the pebbles on the hungry beach
28028,Coriolanus,9,5.3.65,CORIOLANUS,"Fillip the stars, then let the mutinous winds"
28029,Coriolanus,9,5.3.66,CORIOLANUS,"Strike the proud cedars 'gainst the fiery sun,"
28030,Coriolanus,9,5.3.67,CORIOLANUS,"Murdering impossibility, to make"
28031,Coriolanus,9,5.3.68,CORIOLANUS,"What cannot be, slight work."
28032,Coriolanus,10,5.3.69,VOLUMNIA,"Thou art my warrior,"
28033,Coriolanus,10,5.3.70,VOLUMNIA,I holp to frame thee. Do you know this lady?
28034,Coriolanus,11,5.3.71,CORIOLANUS,"The noble sister of Publicola,"
28035,Coriolanus,11,5.3.72,CORIOLANUS,"The moon of Rome, chaste as the icicle"
28036,Coriolanus,11,5.3.73,CORIOLANUS,That's curdied by the frost from purest snow
28037,Coriolanus,11,5.3.74,CORIOLANUS,And hangs on Dian's temple: dear Valeria!
28038,Coriolanus,12,5.3.75,VOLUMNIA,"This is a poor epitome of yours,"
28039,Coriolanus,12,5.3.76,VOLUMNIA,Which by the interpretation of full time
28040,Coriolanus,12,5.3.77,VOLUMNIA,May show like all yourself.
28041,Coriolanus,13,5.3.78,CORIOLANUS,"The god of soldiers,"
28042,Coriolanus,13,5.3.79,CORIOLANUS,"With the consent of supreme Jove, inform"
28043,Coriolanus,13,5.3.80,CORIOLANUS,"Thy thoughts with nobleness, that thou mayst prove"
28044,Coriolanus,13,5.3.81,CORIOLANUS,"To shame unvulnerable, and stick i' the wars"
28045,Coriolanus,13,5.3.82,CORIOLANUS,"Like a great sea-mark, standing every flaw,"
28046,Coriolanus,13,5.3.83,CORIOLANUS,And saving those that eye thee!
28047,Coriolanus,14,5.3.84,VOLUMNIA,"Your knee, sirrah."
28048,Coriolanus,15,5.3.85,CORIOLANUS,That's my brave boy!
28049,Coriolanus,16,5.3.86,VOLUMNIA,"Even he, your wife, this lady, and myself,"
28050,Coriolanus,16,5.3.87,VOLUMNIA,Are suitors to you.
28051,Coriolanus,17,5.3.88,CORIOLANUS,"I beseech you, peace:"
28052,Coriolanus,17,5.3.89,CORIOLANUS,"Or, if you'ld ask, remember this before:"
28053,Coriolanus,17,5.3.90,CORIOLANUS,The thing I have forsworn to grant may never
28054,Coriolanus,17,5.3.91,CORIOLANUS,Be held by you denials. Do not bid me
28055,Coriolanus,17,5.3.92,CORIOLANUS,"Dismiss my soldiers, or capitulate"
28056,Coriolanus,17,5.3.93,CORIOLANUS,Again with Rome's mechanics: tell me not
28057,Coriolanus,17,5.3.94,CORIOLANUS,Wherein I seem unnatural: desire not
28058,Coriolanus,17,5.3.95,CORIOLANUS,To ally my rages and revenges with
28059,Coriolanus,17,5.3.96,CORIOLANUS,Your colder reasons.
28060,Coriolanus,18,5.3.97,VOLUMNIA,"O, no more, no more!"
28061,Coriolanus,18,5.3.98,VOLUMNIA,"You have said you will not grant us any thing,"
28062,Coriolanus,18,5.3.99,VOLUMNIA,"For we have nothing else to ask, but that"
28063,Coriolanus,18,5.3.100,VOLUMNIA,"Which you deny already: yet we will ask,"
28064,Coriolanus,18,5.3.101,VOLUMNIA,"That, if you fail in our request, the blame"
28065,Coriolanus,18,5.3.102,VOLUMNIA,May hang upon your hardness: therefore hear us.
28066,Coriolanus,19,5.3.103,CORIOLANUS,"Aufidius, and you Volsces, mark, for we'll"
28067,Coriolanus,19,5.3.104,CORIOLANUS,Hear nought from Rome in private. Your request?
28068,Coriolanus,20,5.3.105,VOLUMNIA,"Should we be silent and not speak, our raiment"
28069,Coriolanus,20,5.3.106,VOLUMNIA,And state of bodies would bewray what life
28070,Coriolanus,20,5.3.107,VOLUMNIA,We have led since thy exile. Think with thyself
28071,Coriolanus,20,5.3.108,VOLUMNIA,How more unfortunate than all living women
28072,Coriolanus,20,5.3.109,VOLUMNIA,"Are we come hither: since that thy sight,"
28073,Coriolanus,20,5.3.110,VOLUMNIA,which should
28074,Coriolanus,20,5.3.111,VOLUMNIA,"Make our eyes flow with joy, hearts dance"
28075,Coriolanus,20,5.3.112,VOLUMNIA,"with comforts,"
28076,Coriolanus,20,5.3.113,VOLUMNIA,"Constrains them weep and shake with fear and sorrow,"
28077,Coriolanus,20,5.3.114,VOLUMNIA,"Making the mother, wife and child to see"
28078,Coriolanus,20,5.3.115,VOLUMNIA,"The son, the husband and the father tearing"
28079,Coriolanus,20,5.3.116,VOLUMNIA,His country's bowels out. And to poor we

28084,Coriolanus,20,5.3.121,VOLUMNIA,"Whereto we are bound, together with thy victory,"
28085,Coriolanus,20,5.3.122,VOLUMNIA,"Whereto we are bound? alack, or we must lose"

28087,Coriolanus,20,5.3.124,VOLUMNIA,Our comfort in the country. We must find
28088,Coriolanus,20,5.3.125,VOLUMNIA,"An evident calamity, though we had"

28094,Coriolanus,20,5.3.131,VOLUMNIA,"Thy wife and children's blood. For myself, son,"
28095,Coriolanus,20,5.3.132,VOLUMNIA,I purpose not to wait on fortune till
28096,Coriolanus,20,5.3.133,VOLUMNIA,These wars determine: if I cannot persuade thee
28097,Coriolanus,20,5.3.134,VOLUMNIA,Rather to show a noble grace to both parts
28098,Coriolanus,20,5.3.135,VOLUMNIA,"Than seek the end of one, thou shalt no sooner"
28099,Coriolanus,20,5.3.136,VOLUMNIA,March to assault thy country than to tread--
28100,Coriolanus,20,5.3.137,VOLUMNIA,"Trust to't, thou shalt not--on thy mother's womb,"
28101,Coriolanus,20,5.3.138,VOLUMNIA,That brought thee to this world.
28102,Coriolanus,21,5.3.139,VIRGILIA,"Ay, and mine,"
28103,Coriolanus,21,5.3.140,VIRGILIA,"That brought you forth this boy, to keep your name"
28104,Coriolanus,21,5.3.141,VIRGILIA,Living to time.
28105,Coriolanus,22,5.3.142,Young MARCIUS,"A' shall not tread on me,"
28106,Coriolanus,22,5.3.143,Young MARCIUS,"I'll run away till I am bigger, but then I'll fight."
28107,Coriolanus,23,5.3.144,CORIOLANUS,"Not of a woman's tenderness to be,"
28108,Coriolanus,23,5.3.145,CORIOLANUS,Requires nor child nor woman's face to see.
28109,Coriolanus,23,5.3.146,CORIOLANUS,I have sat too long.
28110,Coriolanus,23,,CORIOLANUS,Rising
28111,Coriolanus,24,5.3.147,VOLUMNIA,"Nay, go not from us thus."
28112,Coriolanus,24,5.3.148,VOLUMNIA,If it were so that our request did tend
28113,Coriolanus,24,5.3.149,VOLUMNIA,"To save the Romans, thereby to destroy"
28114,Coriolanus,24,5.3.150,VOLUMNIA,"The Volsces whom you serve, you might condemn us,"
28115,Coriolanus,24,5.3.151,VOLUMNIA,"As poisonous of your honour: no, our suit"
28116,Coriolanus,24,5.3.152,VOLUMNIA,Is that you reconcile them: while the Volsces
28117,Coriolanus,24,5.3.153,VOLUMNIA,"May say 'This mercy we have show'd,' the Romans,"
28118,Coriolanus,24,5.3.154,VOLUMNIA,"'This we received,' and each in either side"
28119,Coriolanus,24,5.3.155,VOLUMNIA,Give the all-hail to thee and cry 'Be blest
28120,Coriolanus,24,5.3.156,VOLUMNIA,"For making up this peace!' Thou know'st, great son,"
28121,Coriolanus,24,5.3.157,VOLUMNIA,"The end of war's uncertain, but this certain,"
28122,Coriolanus,24,5.3.158,VOLUMNIA,"That, if thou conquer Rome, the benefit"
28123,Coriolanus,24,5.3.159,VOLUMNIA,"Which thou shalt thereby reap is such a name,"
28124,Coriolanus,24,5.3.160,VOLUMNIA,"Whose repetition will be dogg'd with curses,"
28125,Coriolanus,24,5.3.161,VOLUMNIA,"Whose chronicle thus writ: 'The man was noble,"
28126,Coriolanus,24,5.3.162,VOLUMNIA,"But with his last attempt he wiped it out,"
28127,Coriolanus,24,5.3.163,VOLUMNIA,"Destroy'd his country, and his name remains"
28128,Coriolanus,24,5.3.164,VOLUMNIA,"To the ensuing age abhorr'd.' Speak to me, son:"
28129,Coriolanus,24,5.3.165,VOLUMNIA,"Thou hast affected the fine strains of honour,"
28130,Coriolanus,24,5.3.166,VOLUMNIA,"To imitate the graces of the gods,"
28131,Coriolanus,24,5.3.167,VOLUMNIA,"To tear with thunder the wide cheeks o' the air,"
28132,Coriolanus,24,5.3.168,VOLUMNIA,And yet to charge thy sulphur with a bolt
28133,Coriolanus,24,5.3.169,VOLUMNIA,That should but rive an oak. Why dost not speak?
28134,Coriolanus,24,5.3.170,VOLUMNIA,Think'st thou it honourable for a noble man
28135,Coriolanus,24,5.3.171,VOLUMNIA,"Still to remember wrongs? Daughter, speak you:"
28136,Coriolanus,24,5.3.172,VOLUMNIA,"He cares not for your weeping. Speak thou, boy:"
28137,Coriolanus,24,5.3.173,VOLUMNIA,Perhaps thy childishness will move him more
28138,Coriolanus,24,5.3.174,VOLUMNIA,Than can our reasons. There's no man in the world
28139,Coriolanus,24,5.3.175,VOLUMNIA,"More bound to 's mother, yet here he lets me prate"
28140,Coriolanus,24,5.3.176,VOLUMNIA,Like one i' the stocks. Thou hast never in thy life
28141,Coriolanus,24,5.3.177,VOLUMNIA,"Show'd thy dear mother any courtesy,"
28142,Coriolanus,24,5.3.178,VOLUMNIA,"When she, poor hen, fond of no second brood,"
28143,Coriolanus,24,5.3.179,VOLUMNIA,"Has cluck'd thee to the wars and safely home,"
28144,Coriolanus,24,5.3.180,VOLUMNIA,"Loaden with honour. Say my request's unjust,"
28145,Coriolanus,24,5.3.181,VOLUMNIA,"And spurn me back: but if it be not so,"
28146,Coriolanus,24,5.3.182,VOLUMNIA,"Thou art not honest, and the gods will plague thee,"
28147,Coriolanus,24,5.3.183,VOLUMNIA,That thou restrain'st from me the duty which
28148,Coriolanus,24,5.3.184,VOLUMNIA,To a mother's part belongs. He turns away:
28149,Coriolanus,24,5.3.185,VOLUMNIA,"Down, ladies, let us shame him with our knees."
28150,Coriolanus,24,5.3.186,VOLUMNIA,To his surname Coriolanus 'longs more pride
28151,Coriolanus,24,5.3.187,VOLUMNIA,"Than pity to our prayers. Down: an end,"
28152,Coriolanus,24,5.3.188,VOLUMNIA,"This is the last: so we will home to Rome,"
28153,Coriolanus,24,5.3.189,VOLUMNIA,"And die among our neighbours. Nay, behold 's:"
28154,Coriolanus,24,5.3.190,VOLUMNIA,"This boy, that cannot tell what he would have"
28155,Coriolanus,24,5.3.191,VOLUMNIA,"But kneels and holds up bands for fellowship,"
28156,Coriolanus,24,5.3.192,VOLUMNIA,Does reason our petition with more strength
28157,Coriolanus,24,5.3.193,VOLUMNIA,"Than thou hast to deny 't. Come, let us go:"
28158,Coriolanus,24,5.3.194,VOLUMNIA,"This fellow had a Volscian to his mother,"
28159,Coriolanus,24,5.3.195,VOLUMNIA,His wife is in Corioli and his child
28160,Coriolanus,24,5.3.196,VOLUMNIA,Like him by chance. Yet give us our dispatch:
28161,Coriolanus,24,5.3.197,VOLUMNIA,"I am hush'd until our city be a-fire,"
28162,Coriolanus,24,5.3.198,VOLUMNIA,And then I'll speak a little.
28163,Coriolanus,24,,VOLUMNIA,"He holds her by the hand, silent"
28164,Coriolanus,25,5.3.199,CORIOLANUS,"O mother, mother!"
28165,Coriolanus,25,5.3.200,CORIOLANUS,"What have you done? Behold, the heavens do ope,"
28166,Coriolanus,25,5.3.201,CORIOLANUS,"The gods look down, and this unnatural scene"
28167,Coriolanus,25,5.3.202,CORIOLANUS,"They laugh at. O my mother, mother! O!"
28168,Coriolanus,25,5.3.203,CORIOLANUS,"You have won a happy victory to Rome,"
28169,Coriolanus,25,5.3.204,CORIOLANUS,"But, for your son,--believe it, O, believe it,"
28170,Coriolanus,25,5.3.205,CORIOLANUS,"Most dangerously you have with him prevail'd,"
28171,Coriolanus,25,5.3.206,CORIOLANUS,"If not most mortal to him. But, let it come."
28172,Coriolanus,25,5.3.207,CORIOLANUS,"Aufidius, though I cannot make true wars,"
28173,Coriolanus,25,5.3.208,CORIOLANUS,"I'll frame convenient peace. Now, good Aufidius,"
28174,Coriolanus,25,5.3.209,CORIOLANUS,"Were you in my stead, would you have heard"
28175,Coriolanus,25,5.3.210,CORIOLANUS,"A mother less? or granted less, Aufidius?"
28176,Coriolanus,26,5.3.211,AUFIDIUS,I was moved withal.
28177,Coriolanus,27,5.3.212,CORIOLANUS,I dare be sworn you were:
28178,Coriolanus,27,5.3.213,CORIOLANUS,"And, sir, it is no little thing to make"
28179,Coriolanus,27,5.3.214,CORIOLANUS,"Mine eyes to sweat compassion. But, good sir,"
28180,Coriolanus,27,5.3.215,CORIOLANUS,"What peace you'll make, advise me: for my part,"
28181,Coriolanus,27,5.3.216,CORIOLANUS,"I'll not to Rome, I'll back with you, and pray you,"
28182,Coriolanus,27,5.3.217,CORIOLANUS,Stand to me in this cause. O mother! wife!
28183,Coriolanus,28,5.3.218,AUFIDIUS,[Aside]  I am glad thou hast set thy mercy and
28184,Coriolanus,28,5.3.219,AUFIDIUS,thy honour
28185,Coriolanus,28,5.3.220,AUFIDIUS,At difference in thee: out of that I'll work
28186,Coriolanus,28,5.3.221,AUFIDIUS,Myself a former fortune.
28187,Coriolanus,28,,AUFIDIUS,The Ladies make signs to CORIOLANUS
28188,Coriolanus,29,5.3.222,CORIOLANUS,"Ay, by and by,"
28189,Coriolanus,29,5.3.222,CORIOLANUS,"To VOLUMNIA, VIRGILIA,  and c"
28190,Coriolanus,29,5.3.223,CORIOLANUS,"But we will drink together, and you shall bear"
28191,Coriolanus,29,5.3.224,CORIOLANUS,"A better witness back than words, which we,"
28192,Coriolanus,29,5.3.225,CORIOLANUS,"On like conditions, will have counter-seal'd."
28193,Coriolanus,29,5.3.226,CORIOLANUS,"Come, enter with us. Ladies, you deserve"
28194,Coriolanus,29,5.3.227,CORIOLANUS,To have a temple built you: all the swords
28195,Coriolanus,29,5.3.228,CORIOLANUS,"In Italy, and her confederate arms,"
28196,Coriolanus,29,5.3.229,CORIOLANUS,Could not have made this peace.
28197,Coriolanus,29,,CORIOLANUS,Exeunt
28198,Coriolanus,29,,CORIOLANUS,SCENE IV. Rome. A public place.
28199,Coriolanus,29,,CORIOLANUS,Enter MENENIUS and SICINIUS
28200,Coriolanus,1,5.4.1,MENENIUS,"See you yond coign o' the Capitol, yond"
28201,Coriolanus,1,5.4.2,MENENIUS,corner-stone?
28202,Coriolanus,2,5.4.3,SICINIUS,"Why, what of that?"
28203,Coriolanus,3,5.4.4,MENENIUS,If it be possible for you to displace it with your
28204,Coriolanus,3,5.4.5,MENENIUS,"little finger, there is some hope the ladies of"
28205,Coriolanus,3,5.4.6,MENENIUS,"Rome, especially his mother, may prevail with him."
28206,Coriolanus,3,5.4.7,MENENIUS,But I say there is no hope in't: our throats are
28207,Coriolanus,3,5.4.8,MENENIUS,sentenced and stay upon execution.
28208,Coriolanus,4,5.4.9,SICINIUS,Is't possible that so short a time can alter the
28209,Coriolanus,4,5.4.10,SICINIUS,condition of a man!
28210,Coriolanus,5,5.4.11,MENENIUS,"There is differency between a grub and a butterfly,"
28211,Coriolanus,5,5.4.12,MENENIUS,yet your butterfly was a grub. This Marcius is grown
28212,Coriolanus,5,5.4.13,MENENIUS,"from man to dragon: he has wings, he's more than a"
28213,Coriolanus,5,5.4.14,MENENIUS,creeping thing.
28214,Coriolanus,6,5.4.15,SICINIUS,He loved his mother dearly.
28215,Coriolanus,7,5.4.16,MENENIUS,So did he me: and he no more remembers his mother
28216,Coriolanus,7,5.4.17,MENENIUS,now than an eight-year-old horse. The tartness
28217,Coriolanus,7,5.4.18,MENENIUS,"of his face sours ripe grapes: when he walks, he"
28218,Coriolanus,7,5.4.19,MENENIUS,"moves like an engine, and the ground shrinks before"
28219,Coriolanus,7,5.4.20,MENENIUS,his treading: he is able to pierce a corslet with
28220,Coriolanus,7,5.4.21,MENENIUS,"his eye, talks like a knell, and his hum is a"
28221,Coriolanus,7,5.4.22,MENENIUS,"battery. He sits in his state, as a thing made for"
28222,Coriolanus,7,5.4.23,MENENIUS,Alexander. What he bids be done is finished with
28223,Coriolanus,7,5.4.24,MENENIUS,his bidding. He wants nothing of a god but eternity
28224,Coriolanus,7,5.4.25,MENENIUS,and a heaven to throne in.
28225,Coriolanus,8,5.4.26,SICINIUS,"Yes, mercy, if you report him truly."
28226,Coriolanus,9,5.4.27,MENENIUS,I paint him in the character. Mark what mercy his
28227,Coriolanus,9,5.4.28,MENENIUS,mother shall bring from him: there is no more mercy
28228,Coriolanus,9,5.4.29,MENENIUS,"in him than there is milk in a male tiger, that"
28229,Coriolanus,9,5.4.30,MENENIUS,shall our poor city find: and all this is long of
28230,Coriolanus,9,5.4.31,MENENIUS,you.
28231,Coriolanus,10,5.4.32,SICINIUS,The gods be good unto us!
28232,Coriolanus,11,5.4.33,MENENIUS,"No, in such a case the gods will not be good unto"
28233,Coriolanus,11,5.4.34,MENENIUS,"us. When we banished him, we respected not them,"
28234,Coriolanus,11,5.4.35,MENENIUS,"and, he returning to break our necks, they respect not us."
28235,Coriolanus,11,,MENENIUS,Enter a Messenger
28236,Coriolanus,12,5.4.36,Messenger,"Sir, if you'ld save your life, fly to your house:"
28237,Coriolanus,12,5.4.37,Messenger,The plebeians have got your fellow-tribune
28238,Coriolanus,12,5.4.38,Messenger,"And hale him up and down, all swearing, if"
28239,Coriolanus,12,5.4.39,Messenger,"The Roman ladies bring not comfort home,"
28240,Coriolanus,12,5.4.40,Messenger,They'll give him death by inches.
28241,Coriolanus,12,,Messenger,Enter a second Messenger
28242,Coriolanus,13,5.4.41,SICINIUS,What's the news?
28243,Coriolanus,14,5.4.42,Second Messenger,"Good news, good news, the ladies have prevail'd,"
28244,Coriolanus,14,5.4.43,Second Messenger,"The Volscians are dislodged, and Marcius gone:"
28245,Coriolanus,14,5.4.44,Second Messenger,"A merrier day did never yet greet Rome,"
28246,Coriolanus,14,5.4.45,Second Messenger,"No, not the expulsion of the Tarquins."
28247,Coriolanus,15,5.4.46,SICINIUS,"Friend,"
28248,Coriolanus,15,5.4.47,SICINIUS,Art thou certain this is true? is it most certain?
28249,Coriolanus,16,5.4.48,Second Messenger,As certain as I know the sun is fire:
28250,Coriolanus,16,5.4.49,Second Messenger,"Where have you lurk'd, that you make doubt of it?"
28251,Coriolanus,16,5.4.50,Second Messenger,"Ne'er through an arch so hurried the blown tide,"
28252,Coriolanus,16,5.4.51,Second Messenger,"As the recomforted through the gates. Why, hark you!"
28253,Coriolanus,16,5.4.51,Second Messenger,"Trumpets, hautboys, drums beat, all together"
28254,Coriolanus,16,5.4.52,Second Messenger,"The trumpets, sackbuts, psalteries and fifes,"
28255,Coriolanus,16,5.4.53,Second Messenger,"Tabours and cymbals and the shouting Romans,"
28256,Coriolanus,16,5.4.54,Second Messenger,Make the sun dance. Hark you!
28257,Coriolanus,16,,Second Messenger,A shout within
28258,Coriolanus,17,5.4.55,MENENIUS,This is good news:
28259,Coriolanus,17,5.4.56,MENENIUS,I will go meet the ladies. This Volumnia
28260,Coriolanus,17,5.4.57,MENENIUS,"Is worth of consuls, senators, patricians,"
28261,Coriolanus,17,5.4.58,MENENIUS,"A city full, of tribunes, such as you,"
28262,Coriolanus,17,5.4.59,MENENIUS,A sea and land full. You have pray'd well to-day:
28263,Coriolanus,17,5.4.60,MENENIUS,This morning for ten thousand of your throats
28264,Coriolanus,17,5.4.61,MENENIUS,"I'd not have given a doit. Hark, how they joy!"
28265,Coriolanus,17,,MENENIUS,"Music still, with shouts"
28266,Coriolanus,18,5.4.62,SICINIUS,"First, the gods bless you for your tidings, next,"
28267,Coriolanus,18,5.4.63,SICINIUS,Accept my thankfulness.
28268,Coriolanus,19,5.4.64,Second Messenger,"Sir, we have all"
28269,Coriolanus,19,5.4.65,Second Messenger,Great cause to give great thanks.
28270,Coriolanus,20,5.4.66,SICINIUS,They are near the city?
28271,Coriolanus,21,5.4.67,Second Messenger,Almost at point to enter.
28272,Coriolanus,22,5.4.68,SICINIUS,"We will meet them,"
28273,Coriolanus,22,5.4.69,SICINIUS,And help the joy.
28274,Coriolanus,22,,SICINIUS,Exeunt
28275,Coriolanus,22,,SICINIUS,SCENE V. The same. A street near the gate.
28276,Coriolanus,22,,SICINIUS,"Enter two Senators with VOLUMNIA, VIRGILIA,  VALERIA,  and c. passing over the stage, followed by Patricians and others"
28277,Coriolanus,1,5.5.1,First Senator,"Behold our patroness, the life of Rome!"
28278,Coriolanus,1,5.5.2,First Senator,"Call all your tribes together, praise the gods,"
28279,Coriolanus,1,5.5.3,First Senator,"And make triumphant fires, strew flowers before them:"

28289,Coriolanus,1,5.6.3,AUFIDIUS,"Bid them repair to the market place, where I,"
28290,Coriolanus,1,5.6.4,AUFIDIUS,"Even in theirs and in the commons' ears,"
28291,Coriolanus,1,5.6.5,AUFIDIUS,Will vouch the truth of it. Him I accuse

28298,Coriolanus,2,5.6.10,First Conspirator,How is it with our general?
28299,Coriolanus,3,5.6.11,AUFIDIUS,Even so
28300,Coriolanus,3,5.6.12,AUFIDIUS,"As with a man by his own alms empoison'd,"
28301,Coriolanus,3,5.6.13,AUFIDIUS,And with his charity slain.
28302,Coriolanus,4,5.6.14,Second Conspirator,"Most noble sir,"

28307,Coriolanus,5,5.6.19,AUFIDIUS,We must proceed as we do find the people.
28308,Coriolanus,6,5.6.20,Third Conspirator,The people will remain uncertain whilst
28309,Coriolanus,6,5.6.21,Third Conspirator,"'Twixt you there's difference, but the fall of either"
28310,Coriolanus,6,5.6.22,Third Conspirator,Makes the survivor heir of all.
28311,Coriolanus,7,5.6.23,AUFIDIUS,"I know it,"
28312,Coriolanus,7,5.6.24,AUFIDIUS,And my pretext to strike at him admits
28313,Coriolanus,7,5.6.25,AUFIDIUS,"A good construction. I raised him, and I pawn'd"
28314,Coriolanus,7,5.6.26,AUFIDIUS,"Mine honour for his truth: who being so heighten'd,"
28315,Coriolanus,7,5.6.27,AUFIDIUS,"He water'd his new plants with dews of flattery,"
28316,Coriolanus,7,5.6.28,AUFIDIUS,"Seducing so my friends, and, to this end,"
28317,Coriolanus,7,5.6.29,AUFIDIUS,"He bow'd his nature, never known before"
28318,Coriolanus,7,5.6.30,AUFIDIUS,"But to be rough, unswayable and free."
28319,Coriolanus,8,5.6.31,Third Conspirator,"Sir, his stoutness"
28320,Coriolanus,8,5.6.32,Third Conspirator,"When he did stand for consul, which he lost"
28321,Coriolanus,8,5.6.33,Third Conspirator,"By lack of stooping,--"
28322,Coriolanus,9,5.6.34,AUFIDIUS,That I would have spoke of:
28323,Coriolanus,9,5.6.35,AUFIDIUS,"Being banish'd for't, he came unto my hearth,"
28324,Coriolanus,9,5.6.36,AUFIDIUS,"Presented to my knife his throat: I took him,"
28325,Coriolanus,9,5.6.37,AUFIDIUS,"Made him joint-servant with me, gave him way"
28326,Coriolanus,9,5.6.38,AUFIDIUS,"In all his own desires, nay, let him choose"
28327,Coriolanus,9,5.6.39,AUFIDIUS,"Out of my files, his projects to accomplish,"
28328,Coriolanus,9,5.6.40,AUFIDIUS,"My best and freshest men, served his designments"
28329,Coriolanus,9,5.6.41,AUFIDIUS,"In mine own person, holp to reap the fame"
28330,Coriolanus,9,5.6.42,AUFIDIUS,"Which he did end all his, and took some pride"
28331,Coriolanus,9,5.6.43,AUFIDIUS,"To do myself this wrong: till, at the last,"
28332,Coriolanus,9,5.6.44,AUFIDIUS,"I seem'd his follower, not partner, and"
28333,Coriolanus,9,5.6.45,AUFIDIUS,"He waged me with his countenance, as if"
28334,Coriolanus,9,5.6.46,AUFIDIUS,I had been mercenary.
28335,Coriolanus,10,5.6.47,First Conspirator,"So he did, my lord:"
28336,Coriolanus,10,5.6.48,First Conspirator,"The army marvell'd at it, and, in the last,"
28337,Coriolanus,10,5.6.49,First Conspirator,When he had carried Rome and that we look'd
28338,Coriolanus,10,5.6.50,First Conspirator,"For no less spoil than glory,--"
28339,Coriolanus,11,5.6.51,AUFIDIUS,There was it:
28340,Coriolanus,11,5.6.52,AUFIDIUS,For which my sinews shall be stretch'd upon him.
28341,Coriolanus,11,5.6.53,AUFIDIUS,"At a few drops of women's rheum, which are"
28342,Coriolanus,11,5.6.54,AUFIDIUS,"As cheap as lies, he sold the blood and labour"
28343,Coriolanus,11,5.6.55,AUFIDIUS,"Of our great action: therefore shall he die,"
28344,Coriolanus,11,5.6.56,AUFIDIUS,"And I'll renew me in his fall. But, hark!"
28345,Coriolanus,11,,AUFIDIUS,"Drums and trumpets sound, with great shouts of the People"
28346,Coriolanus,12,5.6.57,First Conspirator,"Your native town you enter'd like a post,"
28347,Coriolanus,12,5.6.58,First Conspirator,"And had no welcomes home: but he returns,"
28348,Coriolanus,12,5.6.59,First Conspirator,Splitting the air with noise.
28349,Coriolanus,13,5.6.60,Second Conspirator,"And patient fools,"
28350,Coriolanus,13,5.6.61,Second Conspirator,"Whose children he hath slain, their base throats tear"
28351,Coriolanus,13,5.6.62,Second Conspirator,With giving him glory.
28352,Coriolanus,14,5.6.63,Third Conspirator,"Therefore, at your vantage,"
28353,Coriolanus,14,5.6.64,Third Conspirator,"Ere he express himself, or move the people"
28354,Coriolanus,14,5.6.65,Third Conspirator,"With what he would say, let him feel your sword,"
28355,Coriolanus,14,5.6.66,Third Conspirator,"Which we will second. When he lies along,"
28356,Coriolanus,14,5.6.67,Third Conspirator,After your way his tale pronounced shall bury
28357,Coriolanus,14,5.6.68,Third Conspirator,His reasons with his body.
28358,Coriolanus,15,5.6.69,AUFIDIUS,Say no more:
28359,Coriolanus,15,5.6.70,AUFIDIUS,Here come the lords.
28360,Coriolanus,15,,AUFIDIUS,Enter the Lords of the city
28361,Coriolanus,16,5.6.71,All The Lords,You are most welcome home.
28362,Coriolanus,17,5.6.72,AUFIDIUS,I have not deserved it.
28363,Coriolanus,17,5.6.73,AUFIDIUS,"But, worthy lords, have you with heed perused"
28364,Coriolanus,17,5.6.74,AUFIDIUS,What I have written to you?
28365,Coriolanus,18,5.6.75,Lords,We have.
28366,Coriolanus,19,5.6.76,First Lord,And grieve to hear't.
28367,Coriolanus,19,5.6.77,First Lord,"What faults he made before the last, I think"
28368,Coriolanus,19,5.6.78,First Lord,Might have found easy fines: but there to end
28369,Coriolanus,19,5.6.79,First Lord,Where he was to begin and give away
28370,Coriolanus,19,5.6.80,First Lord,"The benefit of our levies, answering us"
28371,Coriolanus,19,5.6.81,First Lord,"With our own charge, making a treaty where"
28372,Coriolanus,19,5.6.82,First Lord,"There was a yielding,--this admits no excuse."
28373,Coriolanus,20,5.6.83,AUFIDIUS,He approaches: you shall hear him.
28374,Coriolanus,20,5.6.83,AUFIDIUS,"Enter CORIOLANUS, marching with drum and colours, commoners being with him"
28375,Coriolanus,21,5.6.84,CORIOLANUS,"Hail, lords! I am return'd your soldier,"
28376,Coriolanus,21,5.6.85,CORIOLANUS,No more infected with my country's love
28377,Coriolanus,21,5.6.86,CORIOLANUS,"Than when I parted hence, but still subsisting"
28378,Coriolanus,21,5.6.87,CORIOLANUS,Under your great command. You are to know
28379,Coriolanus,21,5.6.88,CORIOLANUS,That prosperously I have attempted and
28380,Coriolanus,21,5.6.89,CORIOLANUS,With bloody passage led your wars even to
28381,Coriolanus,21,5.6.90,CORIOLANUS,The gates of Rome. Our spoils we have brought home
28382,Coriolanus,21,5.6.91,CORIOLANUS,Do more than counterpoise a full third part
28383,Coriolanus,21,5.6.92,CORIOLANUS,The charges of the action. We have made peace
28384,Coriolanus,21,5.6.93,CORIOLANUS,With no less honour to the Antiates
28385,Coriolanus,21,5.6.94,CORIOLANUS,"Than shame to the Romans: and we here deliver,"
28386,Coriolanus,21,5.6.95,CORIOLANUS,"Subscribed by the consuls and patricians,"
28387,Coriolanus,21,5.6.96,CORIOLANUS,"Together with the seal o' the senate, what"
28388,Coriolanus,21,5.6.97,CORIOLANUS,We have compounded on.
28389,Coriolanus,22,5.6.98,AUFIDIUS,"Read it not, noble lords,"
28390,Coriolanus,22,5.6.99,AUFIDIUS,"But tell the traitor, in the high'st degree"
28391,Coriolanus,22,5.6.100,AUFIDIUS,He hath abused your powers.
28392,Coriolanus,23,5.6.101,CORIOLANUS,Traitor! how now!
28393,Coriolanus,24,5.6.102,AUFIDIUS,"Ay, traitor, Marcius!"
28394,Coriolanus,25,5.6.103,CORIOLANUS,Marcius!
28395,Coriolanus,26,5.6.104,AUFIDIUS,"Ay, Marcius, Caius Marcius: dost thou think"
28396,Coriolanus,26,5.6.105,AUFIDIUS,"I'll grace thee with that robbery, thy stol'n name"
28397,Coriolanus,26,5.6.106,AUFIDIUS,Coriolanus in Corioli?
28398,Coriolanus,26,5.6.107,AUFIDIUS,"You lords and heads o' the state, perfidiously"
28399,Coriolanus,26,5.6.108,AUFIDIUS,"He has betray'd your business, and given up,"
28400,Coriolanus,26,5.6.109,AUFIDIUS,"For certain drops of salt, your city Rome,"
28401,Coriolanus,26,5.6.110,AUFIDIUS,"I say 'your city,' to his wife and mother,"
28402,Coriolanus,26,5.6.111,AUFIDIUS,Breaking his oath and resolution like
28403,Coriolanus,26,5.6.112,AUFIDIUS,"A twist of rotten silk, never admitting"
28404,Coriolanus,26,5.6.113,AUFIDIUS,"Counsel o' the war, but at his nurse's tears"
28405,Coriolanus,26,5.6.114,AUFIDIUS,"He whined and roar'd away your victory,"
28406,Coriolanus,26,5.6.115,AUFIDIUS,That pages blush'd at him and men of heart
28407,Coriolanus,26,5.6.116,AUFIDIUS,Look'd wondering each at other.
28408,Coriolanus,27,5.6.117,CORIOLANUS,"Hear'st thou, Mars?"
28409,Coriolanus,28,5.6.118,AUFIDIUS,"Name not the god, thou boy of tears!"
28410,Coriolanus,29,5.6.119,CORIOLANUS,Ha!
28411,Coriolanus,30,5.6.120,AUFIDIUS,No more.
28412,Coriolanus,31,5.6.121,CORIOLANUS,"Measureless liar, thou hast made my heart"
28413,Coriolanus,31,5.6.122,CORIOLANUS,Too great for what contains it. Boy! O slave!
28414,Coriolanus,31,5.6.123,CORIOLANUS,"Pardon me, lords, 'tis the first time that ever"
28415,Coriolanus,31,5.6.124,CORIOLANUS,"I was forced to scold. Your judgments, my grave lords,"
28416,Coriolanus,31,5.6.125,CORIOLANUS,Must give this cur the lie: and his own notion--
28417,Coriolanus,31,5.6.126,CORIOLANUS,"Who wears my stripes impress'd upon him, that"
28418,Coriolanus,31,5.6.127,CORIOLANUS,Must bear my beating to his grave--shall join
28419,Coriolanus,31,5.6.128,CORIOLANUS,To thrust the lie unto him.
28420,Coriolanus,32,5.6.129,First Lord,"Peace, both, and hear me speak."
28421,Coriolanus,33,5.6.130,CORIOLANUS,"Cut me to pieces, Volsces, men and lads,"
28422,Coriolanus,33,5.6.131,CORIOLANUS,Stain all your edges on me. Boy! false hound!
28423,Coriolanus,33,5.6.132,CORIOLANUS,"If you have writ your annals true, 'tis there,"
28424,Coriolanus,33,5.6.133,CORIOLANUS,"That, like an eagle in a dove-cote, I"
28425,Coriolanus,33,5.6.134,CORIOLANUS,Flutter'd your Volscians in Corioli:
28426,Coriolanus,33,5.6.135,CORIOLANUS,Alone I did it. Boy!
28427,Coriolanus,34,5.6.136,AUFIDIUS,"Why, noble lords,"
28428,Coriolanus,34,5.6.137,AUFIDIUS,"Will you be put in mind of his blind fortune,"
28429,Coriolanus,34,5.6.138,AUFIDIUS,"Which was your shame, by this unholy braggart,"
28430,Coriolanus,34,5.6.139,AUFIDIUS,'Fore your own eyes and ears?
28431,Coriolanus,35,5.6.140,All Conspirators,Let him die for't.
28432,Coriolanus,36,5.6.141,All The People,'Tear him to pieces.' 'Do it presently.' 'He kill'd
28433,Coriolanus,36,5.6.142,All The People,my son.' 'My daughter.' 'He killed my cousin
28434,Coriolanus,36,5.6.143,All The People,Marcus.' 'He killed my father.'
28435,Coriolanus,37,5.6.144,Second Lord,"Peace, ho! no outrage: peace!"
28436,Coriolanus,37,5.6.145,Second Lord,The man is noble and his fame folds-in
28437,Coriolanus,37,5.6.146,Second Lord,This orb o' the earth. His last offences to us
28438,Coriolanus,37,5.6.147,Second Lord,"Shall have judicious hearing. Stand, Aufidius,"
28439,Coriolanus,37,5.6.148,Second Lord,And trouble not the peace.
28440,Coriolanus,38,5.6.149,CORIOLANUS,"O that I had him,"
28441,Coriolanus,38,5.6.150,CORIOLANUS,"With six Aufidiuses, or more, his tribe,"
28442,Coriolanus,38,5.6.151,CORIOLANUS,To use my lawful sword!
28443,Coriolanus,39,5.6.152,AUFIDIUS,Insolent villain!
28444,Coriolanus,40,5.6.153,All Conspirators,"Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill him!"
28445,Coriolanus,40,5.6.153,All Conspirators,"The Conspirators draw, and kill CORIOLANUS: AUFIDIUS stands on his body"
28446,Coriolanus,41,5.6.154,Lords,"Hold, hold, hold, hold!"
28447,Coriolanus,42,5.6.155,AUFIDIUS,"My noble masters, hear me speak."
28448,Coriolanus,43,5.6.156,First Lord,"O Tullus,--"
28449,Coriolanus,44,5.6.157,Second Lord,Thou hast done a deed whereat valour will weep.
28450,Coriolanus,45,5.6.158,Third Lord,"Tread not upon him. Masters all, be quiet,"
28451,Coriolanus,45,5.6.159,Third Lord,Put up your swords.
28452,Coriolanus,46,5.6.160,AUFIDIUS,"My lords, when you shall know--as in this rage,"
28453,Coriolanus,46,5.6.161,AUFIDIUS,"Provoked by him, you cannot--the great danger"
28454,Coriolanus,46,5.6.162,AUFIDIUS,"Which this man's life did owe you, you'll rejoice"
28455,Coriolanus,46,5.6.163,AUFIDIUS,That he is thus cut off. Please it your honours
28456,Coriolanus,46,5.6.164,AUFIDIUS,"To call me to your senate, I'll deliver"
28457,Coriolanus,46,5.6.165,AUFIDIUS,"Myself your loyal servant, or endure"
28458,Coriolanus,46,5.6.166,AUFIDIUS,Your heaviest censure.
28459,Coriolanus,47,5.6.167,First Lord,"Bear from hence his body,"
28460,Coriolanus,47,5.6.168,First Lord,And mourn you for him: let him be regarded
28461,Coriolanus,47,5.6.169,First Lord,As the most noble corse that ever herald
28462,Coriolanus,47,5.6.170,First Lord,Did follow to his urn.
28463,Coriolanus,48,5.6.171,Second Lord,His own impatience
28464,Coriolanus,48,5.6.172,Second Lord,Takes from Aufidius a great part of blame.
28465,Coriolanus,48,5.6.173,Second Lord,Let's make the best of it.
28466,Coriolanus,49,5.6.174,AUFIDIUS,"My rage is gone,"
28467,Coriolanus,49,5.6.175,AUFIDIUS,And I am struck with sorrow. Take him up.
28468,Coriolanus,49,5.6.176,AUFIDIUS,"Help, three o' the chiefest soldiers, I'll be one."
28469,Coriolanus,49,5.6.177,AUFIDIUS,"Beat thou the drum, that it speak mournfully:"
28470,Coriolanus,49,5.6.178,AUFIDIUS,Trail your steel pikes. Though in this city he
28471,Coriolanus,49,5.6.179,AUFIDIUS,"Hath widow'd and unchilded many a one,"
28472,Coriolanus,49,5.6.180,AUFIDIUS,"Which to this hour bewail the injury,"
28473,Coriolanus,49,5.6.181,AUFIDIUS,Yet he shall have a noble memory. Assist.
28474,Coriolanus,49,,AUFIDIUS,"Exeunt, bearing the body of CORIOLANUS. A dead march sounded"
28475,Cymbeline,49,,AUFIDIUS,ACT I
28476,Cymbeline,49,,AUFIDIUS,SCENE I. Britain. The garden of Cymbeline's palace.
28477,Cymbeline,49,,AUFIDIUS,Enter two Gentlemen
28478,Cymbeline,1,1.1.1,First Gentleman,You do not meet a man but frowns: our bloods
28479,Cymbeline,1,1.1.2,First Gentleman,No more obey the heavens than our courtiers
28480,Cymbeline,1,1.1.3,First Gentleman,Still seem as does the king.
28481,Cymbeline,2,1.1.4,Second Gentleman,But what's the matter?
28482,Cymbeline,3,1.1.5,First Gentleman,"His daughter, and the heir of's kingdom, whom"
28483,Cymbeline,3,1.1.6,First Gentleman,He purposed to his wife's sole son--a widow
28484,Cymbeline,3,1.1.7,First Gentleman,That late he married--hath referr'd herself
28485,Cymbeline,3,1.1.8,First Gentleman,"Unto a poor but worthy gentleman: she's wedded,"
28486,Cymbeline,3,1.1.9,First Gentleman,"Her husband banish'd, she imprison'd: all"
28487,Cymbeline,3,1.1.10,First Gentleman,"Is outward sorrow, though I think the king"
28488,Cymbeline,3,1.1.11,First Gentleman,Be touch'd at very heart.
28489,Cymbeline,4,1.1.12,Second Gentleman,None but the king?
28490,Cymbeline,5,1.1.13,First Gentleman,"He that hath lost her too, so is the queen,"
28491,Cymbeline,5,1.1.14,First Gentleman,"That most desired the match, but not a courtier,"
28492,Cymbeline,5,1.1.15,First Gentleman,Although they wear their faces to the bent
28493,Cymbeline,5,1.1.16,First Gentleman,"Of the king's look's, hath a heart that is not"
28494,Cymbeline,5,1.1.17,First Gentleman,Glad at the thing they scowl at.
28495,Cymbeline,6,1.1.18,Second Gentleman,And why so?
28496,Cymbeline,7,1.1.19,First Gentleman,He that hath miss'd the princess is a thing
28497,Cymbeline,7,1.1.20,First Gentleman,Too bad for bad report: and he that hath her--
28498,Cymbeline,7,1.1.21,First Gentleman,"I mean, that married her, alack, good man!"
28499,Cymbeline,7,1.1.22,First Gentleman,And therefore banish'd--is a creature such
28500,Cymbeline,7,1.1.23,First Gentleman,"As, to seek through the regions of the earth"
28501,Cymbeline,7,1.1.24,First Gentleman,"For one his like, there would be something failing"
28502,Cymbeline,7,1.1.25,First Gentleman,In him that should compare. I do not think
28503,Cymbeline,7,1.1.26,First Gentleman,So fair an outward and such stuff within
28504,Cymbeline,7,1.1.27,First Gentleman,Endows a man but he.
28505,Cymbeline,8,1.1.28,Second Gentleman,You speak him far.
28506,Cymbeline,9,1.1.29,First Gentleman,"I do extend him, sir, within himself,"
28507,Cymbeline,9,1.1.30,First Gentleman,Crush him together rather than unfold
28508,Cymbeline,9,1.1.31,First Gentleman,His measure duly.
28509,Cymbeline,10,1.1.32,Second Gentleman,What's his name and birth?
28510,Cymbeline,11,1.1.33,First Gentleman,I cannot delve him to the root: his father
28511,Cymbeline,11,1.1.34,First Gentleman,"Was call'd Sicilius, who did join his honour"
28512,Cymbeline,11,1.1.35,First Gentleman,"Against the Romans with Cassibelan,"
28513,Cymbeline,11,1.1.36,First Gentleman,But had his titles by Tenantius whom
28514,Cymbeline,11,1.1.37,First Gentleman,"He served with glory and admired success,"
28515,Cymbeline,11,1.1.38,First Gentleman,"So gain'd the sur-addition Leonatus,"
28516,Cymbeline,11,1.1.39,First Gentleman,"And had, besides this gentleman in question,"
28517,Cymbeline,11,1.1.40,First Gentleman,"Two other sons, who in the wars o' the time"
28518,Cymbeline,11,1.1.41,First Gentleman,"Died with their swords in hand, for which"
28519,Cymbeline,11,1.1.42,First Gentleman,"their father,"
28520,Cymbeline,11,1.1.43,First Gentleman,"Then old and fond of issue, took such sorrow"
28521,Cymbeline,11,1.1.44,First Gentleman,"That he quit being, and his gentle lady,"
28522,Cymbeline,11,1.1.45,First Gentleman,"Big of this gentleman our theme, deceased"
28523,Cymbeline,11,1.1.46,First Gentleman,As he was born. The king he takes the babe
28524,Cymbeline,11,1.1.47,First Gentleman,"To his protection, calls him Posthumus Leonatus,"
28525,Cymbeline,11,1.1.48,First Gentleman,"Breeds him and makes him of his bed-chamber,"
28526,Cymbeline,11,1.1.49,First Gentleman,Puts to him all the learnings that his time
28527,Cymbeline,11,1.1.50,First Gentleman,"Could make him the receiver of, which he took,"
28528,Cymbeline,11,1.1.51,First Gentleman,"As we do air, fast as 'twas minister'd,"
28529,Cymbeline,11,1.1.52,First Gentleman,"And in's spring became a harvest, lived in court--"
28530,Cymbeline,11,1.1.53,First Gentleman,"Which rare it is to do--most praised, most loved,"
28531,Cymbeline,11,1.1.54,First Gentleman,"A sample to the youngest, to the more mature"
28532,Cymbeline,11,1.1.55,First Gentleman,"A glass that feated them, and to the graver"
28533,Cymbeline,11,1.1.56,First Gentleman,"A child that guided dotards, to his mistress,"
28534,Cymbeline,11,1.1.57,First Gentleman,"For whom he now is banish'd, her own price"
28535,Cymbeline,11,1.1.58,First Gentleman,"Proclaims how she esteem'd him and his virtue,"
28536,Cymbeline,11,1.1.59,First Gentleman,By her election may be truly read
28537,Cymbeline,11,1.1.60,First Gentleman,What kind of man he is.
28538,Cymbeline,12,1.1.61,Second Gentleman,I honour him
28539,Cymbeline,12,1.1.62,Second Gentleman,"Even out of your report. But, pray you, tell me,"
28540,Cymbeline,12,1.1.63,Second Gentleman,Is she sole child to the king?
28541,Cymbeline,13,1.1.64,First Gentleman,His only child.
28542,Cymbeline,13,1.1.65,First Gentleman,"He had two sons: if this be worth your hearing,"
28543,Cymbeline,13,1.1.66,First Gentleman,"Mark it: the eldest of them at three years old,"
28544,Cymbeline,13,1.1.67,First Gentleman,"I' the swathing-clothes the other, from their nursery"
28545,Cymbeline,13,1.1.68,First Gentleman,"Were stol'n, and to this hour no guess in knowledge"
28546,Cymbeline,13,1.1.69,First Gentleman,Which way they went.
28547,Cymbeline,14,1.1.70,Second Gentleman,How long is this ago?
28548,Cymbeline,15,1.1.71,First Gentleman,Some twenty years.
28549,Cymbeline,16,1.1.72,Second Gentleman,"That a king's children should be so convey'd,"
28550,Cymbeline,16,1.1.73,Second Gentleman,"So slackly guarded, and the search so slow,"
28551,Cymbeline,16,1.1.74,Second Gentleman,That could not trace them!
28552,Cymbeline,17,1.1.75,First Gentleman,"Howsoe'er 'tis strange,"
28553,Cymbeline,17,1.1.76,First Gentleman,"Or that the negligence may well be laugh'd at,"
28554,Cymbeline,17,1.1.77,First Gentleman,"Yet is it true, sir."
28555,Cymbeline,18,1.1.78,Second Gentleman,I do well believe you.
28556,Cymbeline,19,1.1.79,First Gentleman,"We must forbear: here comes the gentleman,"
28557,Cymbeline,19,1.1.80,First Gentleman,"The queen, and princess."
28558,Cymbeline,19,,First Gentleman,Exeunt
28559,Cymbeline,19,,First Gentleman,"Enter the QUEEN, POSTHUMUS LEONATUS, and IMOGEN"
28560,Cymbeline,20,1.1.81,QUEEN,"No, be assured you shall not find me, daughter,"
28561,Cymbeline,20,1.1.82,QUEEN,"After the slander of most stepmothers,"
28562,Cymbeline,20,1.1.83,QUEEN,"Evil-eyed unto you: you're my prisoner, but"
28563,Cymbeline,20,1.1.84,QUEEN,Your gaoler shall deliver you the keys
28564,Cymbeline,20,1.1.85,QUEEN,"That lock up your restraint. For you, Posthumus,"
28565,Cymbeline,20,1.1.86,QUEEN,"So soon as I can win the offended king,"
28566,Cymbeline,20,1.1.87,QUEEN,"I will be known your advocate: marry, yet"
28567,Cymbeline,20,1.1.88,QUEEN,"The fire of rage is in him, and 'twere good"
28568,Cymbeline,20,1.1.89,QUEEN,You lean'd unto his sentence with what patience
28569,Cymbeline,20,1.1.90,QUEEN,Your wisdom may inform you.
28570,Cymbeline,21,1.1.91,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Please your highness,"
28571,Cymbeline,21,1.1.92,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,I will from hence to-day.
28572,Cymbeline,22,1.1.93,QUEEN,You know the peril.
28573,Cymbeline,22,1.1.94,QUEEN,"I'll fetch a turn about the garden, pitying"
28574,Cymbeline,22,1.1.95,QUEEN,"The pangs of barr'd affections, though the king"
28575,Cymbeline,22,1.1.96,QUEEN,Hath charged you should not speak together.
28576,Cymbeline,22,,QUEEN,Exit
28577,Cymbeline,23,1.1.97,IMOGEN,O
28578,Cymbeline,23,1.1.98,IMOGEN,Dissembling courtesy! How fine this tyrant
28579,Cymbeline,23,1.1.99,IMOGEN,"Can tickle where she wounds! My dearest husband,"
28580,Cymbeline,23,1.1.100,IMOGEN,"I something fear my father's wrath, but nothing--"
28581,Cymbeline,23,1.1.101,IMOGEN,Always reserved my holy duty--what
28582,Cymbeline,23,1.1.102,IMOGEN,"His rage can do on me: you must be gone,"
28583,Cymbeline,23,1.1.103,IMOGEN,And I shall here abide the hourly shot
28584,Cymbeline,23,1.1.104,IMOGEN,"Of angry eyes, not comforted to live,"
28585,Cymbeline,23,1.1.105,IMOGEN,But that there is this jewel in the world
28586,Cymbeline,23,1.1.106,IMOGEN,That I may see again.
28587,Cymbeline,24,1.1.107,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,My queen! my mistress!
28588,Cymbeline,24,1.1.108,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"O lady, weep no more, lest I give cause"
28589,Cymbeline,24,1.1.109,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,To be suspected of more tenderness
28590,Cymbeline,24,1.1.110,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,Than doth become a man. I will remain
28591,Cymbeline,24,1.1.111,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,The loyal'st husband that did e'er plight troth:
28592,Cymbeline,24,1.1.112,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"My residence in Rome at one Philario's,"
28593,Cymbeline,24,1.1.113,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Who to my father was a friend, to me"
28594,Cymbeline,24,1.1.114,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Known but by letter: thither write, my queen,"
28595,Cymbeline,24,1.1.115,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"And with mine eyes I'll drink the words you send,"
28596,Cymbeline,24,1.1.116,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,Though ink be made of gall.
28597,Cymbeline,24,,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,Re-enter QUEEN
28598,Cymbeline,25,1.1.117,QUEEN,"Be brief, I pray you:"
28599,Cymbeline,25,1.1.118,QUEEN,"If the king come, I shall incur I know not"
28600,Cymbeline,25,1.1.119,QUEEN,How much of his displeasure.
28601,Cymbeline,25,,QUEEN,Aside
28602,Cymbeline,25,1.1.120,QUEEN,Yet I'll move him
28603,Cymbeline,25,1.1.121,QUEEN,"To walk this way: I never do him wrong,"
28604,Cymbeline,25,1.1.122,QUEEN,"But he does buy my injuries, to be friends,"
28605,Cymbeline,25,1.1.123,QUEEN,Pays dear for my offences.
28606,Cymbeline,25,,QUEEN,Exit
28607,Cymbeline,26,1.1.124,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,Should we be taking leave
28608,Cymbeline,26,1.1.125,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"As long a term as yet we have to live,"
28609,Cymbeline,26,1.1.126,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,The loathness to depart would grow. Adieu!
28610,Cymbeline,27,1.1.127,IMOGEN,"Nay, stay a little:"
28611,Cymbeline,27,1.1.128,IMOGEN,"Were you but riding forth to air yourself,"
28612,Cymbeline,27,1.1.129,IMOGEN,"Such parting were too petty. Look here, love,"
28613,Cymbeline,27,1.1.130,IMOGEN,"This diamond was my mother's: take it, heart,"
28614,Cymbeline,27,1.1.131,IMOGEN,"But keep it till you woo another wife,"
28615,Cymbeline,27,1.1.132,IMOGEN,When Imogen is dead.
28616,Cymbeline,28,1.1.133,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"How, how! another?"
28617,Cymbeline,28,1.1.134,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"You gentle gods, give me but this I have,"
28618,Cymbeline,28,1.1.135,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,And sear up my embracements from a next
28619,Cymbeline,28,1.1.136,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,With bonds of death!
28620,Cymbeline,28,,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,Putting on the ring
28621,Cymbeline,28,1.1.137,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Remain, remain thou here"
28622,Cymbeline,28,1.1.138,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"While sense can keep it on. And, sweetest, fairest,"
28623,Cymbeline,28,1.1.139,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"As I my poor self did exchange for you,"
28624,Cymbeline,28,1.1.140,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"To your so infinite loss, so in our trifles"
28625,Cymbeline,28,1.1.141,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"I still win of you: for my sake wear this,"
28626,Cymbeline,28,1.1.142,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"It is a manacle of love, I'll place it"
28627,Cymbeline,28,1.1.143,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,Upon this fairest prisoner.
28628,Cymbeline,28,,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,Putting a bracelet upon her arm
28629,Cymbeline,29,1.1.144,IMOGEN,O the gods!
28630,Cymbeline,29,1.1.145,IMOGEN,When shall we see again?
28631,Cymbeline,29,,IMOGEN,Enter CYMBELINE and Lords
28632,Cymbeline,30,1.1.146,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Alack, the king!"
28633,Cymbeline,31,1.1.147,CYMBELINE,"Thou basest thing, avoid! hence, from my sight!"
28634,Cymbeline,31,1.1.148,CYMBELINE,If after this command thou fraught the court
28635,Cymbeline,31,1.1.149,CYMBELINE,"With thy unworthiness, thou diest: away!"
28636,Cymbeline,31,1.1.150,CYMBELINE,Thou'rt poison to my blood.
28637,Cymbeline,32,1.1.151,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,The gods protect you!
28638,Cymbeline,32,1.1.152,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,And bless the good remainders of the court! I am gone.
28639,Cymbeline,32,,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,Exit
28640,Cymbeline,33,1.1.153,IMOGEN,There cannot be a pinch in death
28641,Cymbeline,33,1.1.154,IMOGEN,More sharp than this is.
28642,Cymbeline,34,1.1.155,CYMBELINE,"O disloyal thing,"
28643,Cymbeline,34,1.1.156,CYMBELINE,"That shouldst repair my youth, thou heap'st"
28644,Cymbeline,34,1.1.157,CYMBELINE,A year's age on me.
28645,Cymbeline,35,1.1.158,IMOGEN,"I beseech you, sir,"
28646,Cymbeline,35,1.1.159,IMOGEN,Harm not yourself with your vexation
28647,Cymbeline,35,1.1.160,IMOGEN,"I am senseless of your wrath, a touch more rare"
28648,Cymbeline,35,1.1.161,IMOGEN,"Subdues all pangs, all fears."
28649,Cymbeline,36,1.1.162,CYMBELINE,Past grace? obedience?
28650,Cymbeline,37,1.1.163,IMOGEN,"Past hope, and in despair, that way, past grace."
28651,Cymbeline,38,1.1.164,CYMBELINE,That mightst have had the sole son of my queen!
28652,Cymbeline,39,1.1.165,IMOGEN,"O blest, that I might not! I chose an eagle,"
28653,Cymbeline,39,1.1.166,IMOGEN,And did avoid a puttock.
28654,Cymbeline,40,1.1.167,CYMBELINE,"Thou took'st a beggar, wouldst have made my throne"
28655,Cymbeline,40,1.1.168,CYMBELINE,A seat for baseness.
28656,Cymbeline,41,1.1.169,IMOGEN,"No, I rather added"
28657,Cymbeline,41,1.1.170,IMOGEN,A lustre to it.
28658,Cymbeline,42,1.1.171,CYMBELINE,O thou vile one!
28659,Cymbeline,43,1.1.172,IMOGEN,"Sir,"
28660,Cymbeline,43,1.1.173,IMOGEN,It is your fault that I have loved Posthumus:
28661,Cymbeline,43,1.1.174,IMOGEN,"You bred him as my playfellow, and he is"
28662,Cymbeline,43,1.1.175,IMOGEN,"A man worth any woman, overbuys me"
28663,Cymbeline,43,1.1.176,IMOGEN,Almost the sum he pays.
28664,Cymbeline,44,1.1.177,CYMBELINE,"What, art thou mad?"
28665,Cymbeline,45,1.1.178,IMOGEN,"Almost, sir: heaven restore me! Would I were"
28666,Cymbeline,45,1.1.179,IMOGEN,"A neat-herd's daughter, and my Leonatus"
28667,Cymbeline,45,1.1.180,IMOGEN,Our neighbour shepherd's son!
28668,Cymbeline,46,1.1.181,CYMBELINE,Thou foolish thing!
28669,Cymbeline,46,,CYMBELINE,Re-enter QUEEN
28670,Cymbeline,46,1.1.182,CYMBELINE,They were again together: you have done
28671,Cymbeline,46,1.1.183,CYMBELINE,"Not after our command. Away with her,"
28672,Cymbeline,46,1.1.184,CYMBELINE,And pen her up.
28673,Cymbeline,47,1.1.185,QUEEN,"Beseech your patience. Peace,"
28674,Cymbeline,47,1.1.186,QUEEN,"Dear lady daughter, peace! Sweet sovereign,"
28675,Cymbeline,47,1.1.187,QUEEN,"Leave us to ourselves, and make yourself some comfort"
28676,Cymbeline,47,1.1.188,QUEEN,Out of your best advice.
28677,Cymbeline,48,1.1.189,CYMBELINE,"Nay, let her languish"
28678,Cymbeline,48,1.1.190,CYMBELINE,"A drop of blood a day, and, being aged,"
28679,Cymbeline,48,1.1.191,CYMBELINE,Die of this folly!
28680,Cymbeline,48,,CYMBELINE,Exeunt CYMBELINE and Lords
28681,Cymbeline,49,1.1.192,QUEEN,Fie! you must give way.
28682,Cymbeline,49,,QUEEN,Enter PISANIO
28683,Cymbeline,49,1.1.193,QUEEN,"Here is your servant. How now, sir! What news?"
28684,Cymbeline,50,1.1.194,PISANIO,My lord your son drew on my master.
28685,Cymbeline,51,1.1.195,QUEEN,Ha!
28686,Cymbeline,51,1.1.196,QUEEN,"No harm, I trust, is done?"
28687,Cymbeline,52,1.1.197,PISANIO,"There might have been,"
28688,Cymbeline,52,1.1.198,PISANIO,But that my master rather play'd than fought
28689,Cymbeline,52,1.1.199,PISANIO,And had no help of anger: they were parted
28690,Cymbeline,52,1.1.200,PISANIO,By gentlemen at hand.
28691,Cymbeline,53,1.1.201,QUEEN,I am very glad on't.
28692,Cymbeline,54,1.1.202,IMOGEN,"Your son's my father's friend, he takes his part."
28693,Cymbeline,54,1.1.203,IMOGEN,To draw upon an exile! O brave sir!
28694,Cymbeline,54,1.1.204,IMOGEN,"I would they were in Afric both together,"
28695,Cymbeline,54,1.1.205,IMOGEN,"Myself by with a needle, that I might prick"
28696,Cymbeline,54,1.1.206,IMOGEN,The goer-back. Why came you from your master?
28697,Cymbeline,55,1.1.207,PISANIO,On his command: he would not suffer me
28698,Cymbeline,55,1.1.208,PISANIO,"To bring him to the haven, left these notes"
28699,Cymbeline,55,1.1.209,PISANIO,"Of what commands I should be subject to,"
28700,Cymbeline,55,1.1.210,PISANIO,When 't pleased you to employ me.
28701,Cymbeline,56,1.1.211,QUEEN,This hath been
28702,Cymbeline,56,1.1.212,QUEEN,Your faithful servant: I dare lay mine honour
28703,Cymbeline,56,1.1.213,QUEEN,He will remain so.
28704,Cymbeline,57,1.1.214,PISANIO,I humbly thank your highness.
28705,Cymbeline,58,1.1.215,QUEEN,"Pray, walk awhile."
28706,Cymbeline,59,1.1.216,IMOGEN,"About some half-hour hence,"
28707,Cymbeline,59,1.1.217,IMOGEN,"I pray you, speak with me: you shall at least"
28708,Cymbeline,59,1.1.218,IMOGEN,Go see my lord aboard: for this time leave me.

28711,Cymbeline,59,,IMOGEN,Enter CLOTEN and two Lords
28712,Cymbeline,1,1.2.1,First Lord,"Sir, I would advise you to shift a shirt, the"
28713,Cymbeline,1,1.2.2,First Lord,violence of action hath made you reek as a
28714,Cymbeline,1,1.2.3,First Lord,"sacrifice: where air comes out, air comes in:"
28715,Cymbeline,1,1.2.4,First Lord,there's none abroad so wholesome as that you vent.
28716,Cymbeline,2,1.2.5,CLOTEN,"If my shirt were bloody, then to shift it. Have I hurt him?"
28717,Cymbeline,3,1.2.6,Second Lord,"[Aside]  No, 'faith, not so much as his patience."
28718,Cymbeline,4,1.2.7,First Lord,"Hurt him! his body's a passable carcass, if he be"
28719,Cymbeline,4,1.2.8,First Lord,"not hurt: it is a thoroughfare for steel, if it be not hurt."
28720,Cymbeline,5,1.2.9,Second Lord,"[Aside]  His steel was in debt, it went o' the"
28721,Cymbeline,5,1.2.10,Second Lord,backside the town.
28722,Cymbeline,6,1.2.11,CLOTEN,The villain would not stand me.
28723,Cymbeline,7,1.2.12,Second Lord,"[Aside]  No, but he fled forward still, toward your face."
28724,Cymbeline,8,1.2.13,First Lord,Stand you! You have land enough of your own: but
28725,Cymbeline,8,1.2.14,First Lord,"he added to your having, gave you some ground."
28726,Cymbeline,9,1.2.15,Second Lord,[Aside]  As many inches as you have oceans. Puppies!
28727,Cymbeline,10,1.2.16,CLOTEN,I would they had not come between us.
28728,Cymbeline,11,1.2.17,Second Lord,"[Aside]  So would I, till you had measured how long"
28729,Cymbeline,11,1.2.18,Second Lord,a fool you were upon the ground.
28730,Cymbeline,12,1.2.19,CLOTEN,And that she should love this fellow and refuse me!
28731,Cymbeline,13,1.2.20,Second Lord,"[Aside]  If it be a sin to make a true election, she"
28732,Cymbeline,13,1.2.21,Second Lord,is damned.
28733,Cymbeline,14,1.2.22,First Lord,"Sir, as I told you always, her beauty and her brain"
28734,Cymbeline,14,1.2.23,First Lord,"go not together: she's a good sign, but I have seen"
28735,Cymbeline,14,1.2.24,First Lord,small reflection of her wit.
28736,Cymbeline,15,1.2.25,Second Lord,"[Aside]  She shines not upon fools, lest the"
28737,Cymbeline,15,1.2.26,Second Lord,reflection should hurt her.
28738,Cymbeline,16,1.2.27,CLOTEN,"Come, I'll to my chamber. Would there had been some"
28739,Cymbeline,16,1.2.28,CLOTEN,hurt done!
28740,Cymbeline,17,1.2.29,Second Lord,"[Aside]  I wish not so, unless it had been the fall"
28741,Cymbeline,17,1.2.30,Second Lord,"of an ass, which is no great hurt."
28742,Cymbeline,18,1.2.31,CLOTEN,You'll go with us?
28743,Cymbeline,19,1.2.32,First Lord,I'll attend your lordship.
28744,Cymbeline,20,1.2.33,CLOTEN,"Nay, come, let's go together."
28745,Cymbeline,21,1.2.34,Second Lord,"Well, my lord."

28748,Cymbeline,21,,Second Lord,Enter IMOGEN and PISANIO
28749,Cymbeline,1,1.3.1,IMOGEN,"I would thou grew'st unto the shores o' the haven,"
28750,Cymbeline,1,1.3.2,IMOGEN,And question'dst every sail: if he should write
28751,Cymbeline,1,1.3.3,IMOGEN,"And not have it, 'twere a paper lost,"
28752,Cymbeline,1,1.3.4,IMOGEN,As offer'd mercy is. What was the last
28753,Cymbeline,1,1.3.5,IMOGEN,That he spake to thee?
28754,Cymbeline,2,1.3.6,PISANIO,"It was his queen, his queen!"
28755,Cymbeline,3,1.3.7,IMOGEN,Then waved his handkerchief?
28756,Cymbeline,4,1.3.8,PISANIO,"And kiss'd it, madam."
28757,Cymbeline,5,1.3.9,IMOGEN,Senseless Linen! happier therein than I!
28758,Cymbeline,5,1.3.10,IMOGEN,And that was all?
28759,Cymbeline,6,1.3.11,PISANIO,"No, madam, for so long"
28760,Cymbeline,6,1.3.12,PISANIO,As he could make me with this eye or ear
28761,Cymbeline,6,1.3.13,PISANIO,"Distinguish him from others, he did keep"
28762,Cymbeline,6,1.3.14,PISANIO,"The deck, with glove, or hat, or handkerchief,"
28763,Cymbeline,6,1.3.15,PISANIO,"Still waving, as the fits and stirs of 's mind"
28764,Cymbeline,6,1.3.16,PISANIO,"Could best express how slow his soul sail'd on,"
28765,Cymbeline,6,1.3.17,PISANIO,How swift his ship.
28766,Cymbeline,7,1.3.18,IMOGEN,Thou shouldst have made him
28767,Cymbeline,7,1.3.19,IMOGEN,"As little as a crow, or less, ere left"
28768,Cymbeline,7,1.3.20,IMOGEN,To after-eye him.
28769,Cymbeline,8,1.3.21,PISANIO,"Madam, so I did."
28770,Cymbeline,9,1.3.22,IMOGEN,"I would have broke mine eye-strings, crack'd them, but"
28771,Cymbeline,9,1.3.23,IMOGEN,"To look upon him, till the diminution"
28772,Cymbeline,9,1.3.24,IMOGEN,"Of space had pointed him sharp as my needle,"
28773,Cymbeline,9,1.3.25,IMOGEN,"Nay, follow'd him, till he had melted from"
28774,Cymbeline,9,1.3.26,IMOGEN,"The smallness of a gnat to air, and then"
28775,Cymbeline,9,1.3.27,IMOGEN,"Have turn'd mine eye and wept. But, good Pisanio,"
28776,Cymbeline,9,1.3.28,IMOGEN,When shall we hear from him?
28777,Cymbeline,10,1.3.29,PISANIO,"Be assured, madam,"
28778,Cymbeline,10,1.3.30,PISANIO,With his next vantage.
28779,Cymbeline,11,1.3.31,IMOGEN,"I did not take my leave of him, but had"
28780,Cymbeline,11,1.3.32,IMOGEN,Most pretty things to say: ere I could tell him
28781,Cymbeline,11,1.3.33,IMOGEN,How I would think on him at certain hours
28782,Cymbeline,11,1.3.34,IMOGEN,"Such thoughts and such, or I could make him swear"
28783,Cymbeline,11,1.3.35,IMOGEN,The shes of Italy should not betray
28784,Cymbeline,11,1.3.36,IMOGEN,"Mine interest and his honour, or have charged him,"
28785,Cymbeline,11,1.3.37,IMOGEN,"At the sixth hour of morn, at noon, at midnight,"
28786,Cymbeline,11,1.3.38,IMOGEN,"To encounter me with orisons, for then"
28787,Cymbeline,11,1.3.39,IMOGEN,"I am in heaven for him, or ere I could"
28788,Cymbeline,11,1.3.40,IMOGEN,Give him that parting kiss which I had set
28789,Cymbeline,11,1.3.41,IMOGEN,"Betwixt two charming words, comes in my father"
28790,Cymbeline,11,1.3.42,IMOGEN,And like the tyrannous breathing of the north
28791,Cymbeline,11,1.3.43,IMOGEN,Shakes all our buds from growing.
28792,Cymbeline,11,,IMOGEN,Enter a Lady
28793,Cymbeline,12,1.3.44,Lady,"The queen, madam,"
28794,Cymbeline,12,1.3.45,Lady,Desires your highness' company.
28795,Cymbeline,13,1.3.46,IMOGEN,"Those things I bid you do, get them dispatch'd."
28796,Cymbeline,13,1.3.47,IMOGEN,I will attend the queen.
28797,Cymbeline,14,1.3.48,PISANIO,"Madam, I shall."
28798,Cymbeline,14,,PISANIO,Exeunt
28799,Cymbeline,14,,PISANIO,SCENE IV. Rome. Philario's house.
28800,Cymbeline,14,,PISANIO,"Enter PHILARIO, IACHIMO, a Frenchman, a Dutchman, and a Spaniard"
28801,Cymbeline,1,1.4.1,IACHIMO,"Believe it, sir, I have seen him in Britain: he was"
28802,Cymbeline,1,1.4.2,IACHIMO,"then of a crescent note, expected to prove so worthy"
28803,Cymbeline,1,1.4.3,IACHIMO,"as since he hath been allowed the name of, but I"
28804,Cymbeline,1,1.4.4,IACHIMO,could then have looked on him without the help of
28805,Cymbeline,1,1.4.5,IACHIMO,"admiration, though the catalogue of his endowments"
28806,Cymbeline,1,1.4.6,IACHIMO,had been tabled by his side and I to peruse him by items.
28807,Cymbeline,2,1.4.7,PHILARIO,You speak of him when he was less furnished than now
28808,Cymbeline,2,1.4.8,PHILARIO,he is with that which makes him both without and within.
28809,Cymbeline,3,1.4.9,Frenchman,I have seen him in France: we had very many there
28810,Cymbeline,3,1.4.10,Frenchman,could behold the sun with as firm eyes as he.
28811,Cymbeline,4,1.4.11,IACHIMO,"This matter of marrying his king's daughter, wherein"
28812,Cymbeline,4,1.4.12,IACHIMO,"he must be weighed rather by her value than his own,"
28813,Cymbeline,4,1.4.13,IACHIMO,"words him, I doubt not, a great deal from the matter."
28814,Cymbeline,5,1.4.14,Frenchman,And then his banishment.
28815,Cymbeline,6,1.4.15,IACHIMO,"Ay, and the approbation of those that weep this"
28816,Cymbeline,6,1.4.16,IACHIMO,lamentable divorce under her colours are wonderfully
28817,Cymbeline,6,1.4.17,IACHIMO,"to extend him, be it but to fortify her judgment,"
28818,Cymbeline,6,1.4.18,IACHIMO,"which else an easy battery might lay flat, for"
28819,Cymbeline,6,1.4.19,IACHIMO,taking a beggar without less quality. But how comes
28820,Cymbeline,6,1.4.20,IACHIMO,it he is to sojourn with you? How creeps
28821,Cymbeline,6,1.4.21,IACHIMO,acquaintance?
28822,Cymbeline,7,1.4.22,PHILARIO,"His father and I were soldiers together, to whom I"
28823,Cymbeline,7,1.4.23,PHILARIO,have been often bound for no less than my life.
28824,Cymbeline,7,1.4.24,PHILARIO,Here comes the Briton: let him be so entertained
28825,Cymbeline,7,1.4.25,PHILARIO,"amongst you as suits, with gentlemen of your"
28826,Cymbeline,7,1.4.26,PHILARIO,"knowing, to a stranger of his quality."
28827,Cymbeline,7,,PHILARIO,Enter POSTHUMUS LEONATUS
28828,Cymbeline,7,1.4.27,PHILARIO,"I beseech you all, be better known to this"
28829,Cymbeline,7,1.4.28,PHILARIO,"gentleman, whom I commend to you as a noble friend"
28830,Cymbeline,7,1.4.29,PHILARIO,of mine: how worthy he is I will leave to appear
28831,Cymbeline,7,1.4.30,PHILARIO,"hereafter, rather than story him in his own hearing."
28832,Cymbeline,8,1.4.31,Frenchman,"Sir, we have known together in Orleans."
28833,Cymbeline,9,1.4.32,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Since when I have been debtor to you for courtesies,"
28834,Cymbeline,9,1.4.33,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,which I will be ever to pay and yet pay still.
28835,Cymbeline,10,1.4.34,Frenchman,"Sir, you o'er-rate my poor kindness: I was glad I"
28836,Cymbeline,10,1.4.35,Frenchman,"did atone my countryman and you, it had been pity"
28837,Cymbeline,10,1.4.36,Frenchman,you should have been put together with so mortal a
28838,Cymbeline,10,1.4.37,Frenchman,"purpose as then each bore, upon importance of so"
28839,Cymbeline,10,1.4.38,Frenchman,slight and trivial a nature.
28840,Cymbeline,11,1.4.39,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"By your pardon, sir, I was then a young traveller,"
28841,Cymbeline,11,1.4.40,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,rather shunned to go even with what I heard than in
28842,Cymbeline,11,1.4.41,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,my every action to be guided by others' experiences:
28843,Cymbeline,11,1.4.42,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,but upon my mended judgment--if I offend not to say
28844,Cymbeline,11,1.4.43,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,it is mended--my quarrel was not altogether slight.
28845,Cymbeline,12,1.4.44,Frenchman,"'Faith, yes, to be put to the arbitrement of swords,"
28846,Cymbeline,12,1.4.45,Frenchman,and by such two that would by all likelihood have
28847,Cymbeline,12,1.4.46,Frenchman,"confounded one the other, or have fallen both."
28848,Cymbeline,13,1.4.47,IACHIMO,"Can we, with manners, ask what was the difference?"
28849,Cymbeline,14,1.4.48,Frenchman,"Safely, I think: 'twas a contention in public,"
28850,Cymbeline,14,1.4.49,Frenchman,"which may, without contradiction, suffer the report."
28851,Cymbeline,14,1.4.50,Frenchman,It was much like an argument that fell out last
28852,Cymbeline,14,1.4.51,Frenchman,"night, where each of us fell in praise of our"
28853,Cymbeline,14,1.4.52,Frenchman,"country mistresses, this gentleman at that time"
28854,Cymbeline,14,1.4.53,Frenchman,vouching--and upon warrant of bloody
28855,Cymbeline,14,1.4.54,Frenchman,"affirmation--his to be more fair, virtuous, wise,"
28856,Cymbeline,14,1.4.55,Frenchman,"chaste, constant-qualified and less attemptable"
28857,Cymbeline,14,1.4.56,Frenchman,than any the rarest of our ladies in France.
28858,Cymbeline,15,1.4.57,IACHIMO,"That lady is not now living, or this gentleman's"
28859,Cymbeline,15,1.4.58,IACHIMO,opinion by this worn out.
28860,Cymbeline,16,1.4.59,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,She holds her virtue still and I my mind.
28861,Cymbeline,17,1.4.60,IACHIMO,You must not so far prefer her 'fore ours of Italy.
28862,Cymbeline,18,1.4.61,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Being so far provoked as I was in France, I would"
28863,Cymbeline,18,1.4.62,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"abate her nothing, though I profess myself her"
28864,Cymbeline,18,1.4.63,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"adorer, not her friend."
28865,Cymbeline,19,1.4.64,IACHIMO,As fair and as good--a kind of hand-in-hand
28866,Cymbeline,19,1.4.65,IACHIMO,comparison--had been something too fair and too good
28867,Cymbeline,19,1.4.66,IACHIMO,for any lady in Britain. If she went before others
28868,Cymbeline,19,1.4.67,IACHIMO,"I have seen, as that diamond of yours outlustres"
28869,Cymbeline,19,1.4.68,IACHIMO,many I have beheld. I could not but believe she
28870,Cymbeline,19,1.4.69,IACHIMO,excelled many: but I have not seen the most
28871,Cymbeline,19,1.4.70,IACHIMO,"precious diamond that is, nor you the lady."
28872,Cymbeline,20,1.4.71,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,I praised her as I rated her: so do I my stone.
28873,Cymbeline,21,1.4.72,IACHIMO,What do you esteem it at?
28874,Cymbeline,22,1.4.73,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,More than the world enjoys.
28875,Cymbeline,23,1.4.74,IACHIMO,"Either your unparagoned mistress is dead, or she's"
28876,Cymbeline,23,1.4.75,IACHIMO,outprized by a trifle.
28877,Cymbeline,24,1.4.76,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"You are mistaken: the one may be sold, or given, if"
28878,Cymbeline,24,1.4.77,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"there were wealth enough for the purchase, or merit"
28879,Cymbeline,24,1.4.78,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"for the gift: the other is not a thing for sale,"
28880,Cymbeline,24,1.4.79,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,and only the gift of the gods.
28881,Cymbeline,25,1.4.80,IACHIMO,Which the gods have given you?
28882,Cymbeline,26,1.4.81,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Which, by their graces, I will keep."
28883,Cymbeline,27,1.4.82,IACHIMO,"You may wear her in title yours: but, you know,"
28884,Cymbeline,27,1.4.83,IACHIMO,strange fowl light upon neighbouring ponds. Your
28885,Cymbeline,27,1.4.84,IACHIMO,ring may be stolen too: so your brace of unprizable
28886,Cymbeline,27,1.4.85,IACHIMO,"estimations, the one is but frail and the other"
28887,Cymbeline,27,1.4.86,IACHIMO,"casual, a cunning thief, or a that way accomplished"
28888,Cymbeline,27,1.4.87,IACHIMO,"courtier, would hazard the winning both of first and last."
28889,Cymbeline,28,1.4.88,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,Your Italy contains none so accomplished a courtier
28890,Cymbeline,28,1.4.89,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"to convince the honour of my mistress, if, in the"
28891,Cymbeline,28,1.4.90,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"holding or loss of that, you term her frail. I do"
28892,Cymbeline,28,1.4.91,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"nothing doubt you have store of thieves,"
28893,Cymbeline,28,1.4.92,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"notwithstanding, I fear not my ring."
28894,Cymbeline,29,1.4.93,PHILARIO,"Let us leave here, gentlemen."
28895,Cymbeline,30,1.4.94,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Sir, with all my heart. This worthy signior, I"
28896,Cymbeline,30,1.4.95,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"thank him, makes no stranger of me, we are familiar at first."
28897,Cymbeline,31,1.4.96,IACHIMO,"With five times so much conversation, I should get"
28898,Cymbeline,31,1.4.97,IACHIMO,"ground of your fair mistress, make her go back, even"
28899,Cymbeline,31,1.4.98,IACHIMO,"to the yielding, had I admittance and opportunity to friend."
28900,Cymbeline,32,1.4.99,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"No, no."
28901,Cymbeline,33,1.4.100,IACHIMO,I dare thereupon pawn the moiety of my estate to
28902,Cymbeline,33,1.4.101,IACHIMO,"your ring, which, in my opinion, o'ervalues it"
28903,Cymbeline,33,1.4.102,IACHIMO,something: but I make my wager rather against your
28904,Cymbeline,33,1.4.103,IACHIMO,"confidence than her reputation: and, to bar your"
28905,Cymbeline,33,1.4.104,IACHIMO,"offence herein too, I durst attempt it against any"
28906,Cymbeline,33,1.4.105,IACHIMO,lady in the world.
28907,Cymbeline,34,1.4.106,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,You are a great deal abused in too bold a
28908,Cymbeline,34,1.4.107,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"persuasion, and I doubt not you sustain what you're"
28909,Cymbeline,34,1.4.108,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,worthy of by your attempt.
28910,Cymbeline,35,1.4.109,IACHIMO,What's that?
28911,Cymbeline,36,1.4.110,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"A repulse: though your attempt, as you call it,"
28912,Cymbeline,36,1.4.111,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"deserve more, a punishment too."
28913,Cymbeline,37,1.4.112,PHILARIO,"Gentlemen, enough of this: it came in too suddenly,"
28914,Cymbeline,37,1.4.113,PHILARIO,"let it die as it was born, and, I pray you, be"
28915,Cymbeline,37,1.4.114,PHILARIO,better acquainted.
28916,Cymbeline,38,1.4.115,IACHIMO,Would I had put my estate and my neighbour's on the
28917,Cymbeline,38,1.4.116,IACHIMO,approbation of what I have spoke!
28918,Cymbeline,39,1.4.117,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,What lady would you choose to assail?
28919,Cymbeline,40,1.4.118,IACHIMO,"Yours, whom in constancy you think stands so safe."
28920,Cymbeline,40,1.4.119,IACHIMO,"I will lay you ten thousand ducats to your ring,"
28921,Cymbeline,40,1.4.120,IACHIMO,"that, commend me to the court where your lady is,"
28922,Cymbeline,40,1.4.121,IACHIMO,with no more advantage than the opportunity of a
28923,Cymbeline,40,1.4.122,IACHIMO,"second conference, and I will bring from thence"
28924,Cymbeline,40,1.4.123,IACHIMO,that honour of hers which you imagine so reserved.
28925,Cymbeline,41,1.4.124,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"I will wage against your gold, gold to it: my ring"
28926,Cymbeline,41,1.4.125,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"I hold dear as my finger, 'tis part of it."
28927,Cymbeline,42,1.4.126,IACHIMO,"You are afraid, and therein the wiser. If you buy"
28928,Cymbeline,42,1.4.127,IACHIMO,"ladies' flesh at a million a dram, you cannot"
28929,Cymbeline,42,1.4.128,IACHIMO,preserve it from tainting: but I see you have some
28930,Cymbeline,42,1.4.129,IACHIMO,"religion in you, that you fear."
28931,Cymbeline,43,1.4.130,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"This is but a custom in your tongue, you bear a"
28932,Cymbeline,43,1.4.131,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"graver purpose, I hope."
28933,Cymbeline,44,1.4.132,IACHIMO,"I am the master of my speeches, and would undergo"
28934,Cymbeline,44,1.4.133,IACHIMO,"what's spoken, I swear."
28935,Cymbeline,45,1.4.134,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,Will you? I shall but lend my diamond till your
28936,Cymbeline,45,1.4.135,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,return: let there be covenants drawn between's: my
28937,Cymbeline,45,1.4.136,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,mistress exceeds in goodness the hugeness of your
28938,Cymbeline,45,1.4.137,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,unworthy thinking: I dare you to this match: here's my ring.
28939,Cymbeline,46,1.4.138,PHILARIO,I will have it no lay.
28940,Cymbeline,47,1.4.139,IACHIMO,"By the gods, it is one. If I bring you no"
28941,Cymbeline,47,1.4.140,IACHIMO,sufficient testimony that I have enjoyed the dearest
28942,Cymbeline,47,1.4.141,IACHIMO,"bodily part of your mistress, my ten thousand ducats"
28943,Cymbeline,47,1.4.142,IACHIMO,"are yours, so is your diamond too: if I come off,"
28944,Cymbeline,47,1.4.143,IACHIMO,"and leave her in such honour as you have trust in,"
28945,Cymbeline,47,1.4.144,IACHIMO,"she your jewel, this your jewel, and my gold are"
28946,Cymbeline,47,1.4.145,IACHIMO,yours: provided I have your commendation for my more
28947,Cymbeline,47,1.4.146,IACHIMO,free entertainment.
28948,Cymbeline,48,1.4.147,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"I embrace these conditions, let us have articles"
28949,Cymbeline,48,1.4.148,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"betwixt us. Only, thus far you shall answer: if"
28950,Cymbeline,48,1.4.149,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,you make your voyage upon her and give me directly
28951,Cymbeline,48,1.4.150,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"to understand you have prevailed, I am no further"
28952,Cymbeline,48,1.4.151,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"your enemy, she is not worth our debate: if she"
28953,Cymbeline,48,1.4.152,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"remain unseduced, you not making it appear"
28954,Cymbeline,48,1.4.153,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"otherwise, for your ill opinion and the assault you"
28955,Cymbeline,48,1.4.154,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,have made to her chastity you shall answer me with
28956,Cymbeline,48,1.4.155,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,your sword.
28957,Cymbeline,49,1.4.156,IACHIMO,"Your hand, a covenant: we will have these things set"
28958,Cymbeline,49,1.4.157,IACHIMO,"down by lawful counsel, and straight away for"
28959,Cymbeline,49,1.4.158,IACHIMO,"Britain, lest the bargain should catch cold and"
28960,Cymbeline,49,1.4.159,IACHIMO,starve: I will fetch my gold and have our two

28964,Cymbeline,51,1.4.162,Frenchman,"Will this hold, think you?"
28965,Cymbeline,52,1.4.163,PHILARIO,Signior Iachimo will not from it.
28966,Cymbeline,52,1.4.164,PHILARIO,"Pray, let us follow 'em."
28967,Cymbeline,52,,PHILARIO,Exeunt
28968,Cymbeline,52,,PHILARIO,SCENE V. Britain. A room in Cymbeline's palace.
28969,Cymbeline,52,,PHILARIO,"Enter QUEEN, Ladies, and CORNELIUS"
28970,Cymbeline,1,1.5.1,QUEEN,"Whiles yet the dew's on ground, gather those flowers,"
28971,Cymbeline,1,1.5.2,QUEEN,Make haste: who has the note of them?
28972,Cymbeline,2,1.5.3,First Lady,"I, madam."
28973,Cymbeline,3,1.5.4,QUEEN,Dispatch.
28974,Cymbeline,3,,QUEEN,Exeunt Ladies
28975,Cymbeline,3,1.5.5,QUEEN,"Now, master doctor, have you brought those drugs?"
28976,Cymbeline,4,1.5.6,CORNELIUS,"Pleaseth your highness, ay: here they are, madam:"
28977,Cymbeline,4,,CORNELIUS,Presenting a small box
28978,Cymbeline,4,1.5.7,CORNELIUS,"But I beseech your grace, without offence,--"
28979,Cymbeline,4,1.5.8,CORNELIUS,My conscience bids me ask--wherefore you have
28980,Cymbeline,4,1.5.9,CORNELIUS,"Commanded of me those most poisonous compounds,"
28981,Cymbeline,4,1.5.10,CORNELIUS,"Which are the movers of a languishing death,"
28982,Cymbeline,4,1.5.11,CORNELIUS,"But though slow, deadly?"
28983,Cymbeline,5,1.5.12,QUEEN,"I wonder, doctor,"
28984,Cymbeline,5,1.5.13,QUEEN,Thou ask'st me such a question. Have I not been
28985,Cymbeline,5,1.5.14,QUEEN,Thy pupil long? Hast thou not learn'd me how
28986,Cymbeline,5,1.5.15,QUEEN,"To make perfumes? distil? preserve? yea, so"
28987,Cymbeline,5,1.5.16,QUEEN,That our great king himself doth woo me oft
28988,Cymbeline,5,1.5.17,QUEEN,"For my confections? Having thus far proceeded,--"
28989,Cymbeline,5,1.5.18,QUEEN,Unless thou think'st me devilish--is't not meet
28990,Cymbeline,5,1.5.19,QUEEN,That I did amplify my judgment in
28991,Cymbeline,5,1.5.20,QUEEN,Other conclusions? I will try the forces
28992,Cymbeline,5,1.5.21,QUEEN,Of these thy compounds on such creatures as
28993,Cymbeline,5,1.5.22,QUEEN,"We count not worth the hanging, but none human,"
28994,Cymbeline,5,1.5.23,QUEEN,To try the vigour of them and apply
28995,Cymbeline,5,1.5.24,QUEEN,"Allayments to their act, and by them gather"
28996,Cymbeline,5,1.5.25,QUEEN,Their several virtues and effects.
28997,Cymbeline,6,1.5.26,CORNELIUS,Your highness
28998,Cymbeline,6,1.5.27,CORNELIUS,Shall from this practise but make hard your heart:
28999,Cymbeline,6,1.5.28,CORNELIUS,"Besides, the seeing these effects will be"
29000,Cymbeline,6,1.5.29,CORNELIUS,Both noisome and infectious.
29001,Cymbeline,7,1.5.30,QUEEN,"O, content thee."
29002,Cymbeline,7,,QUEEN,Enter PISANIO
29003,Cymbeline,7,,QUEEN,Aside
29004,Cymbeline,7,1.5.31,QUEEN,"Here comes a flattering rascal, upon him"
29005,Cymbeline,7,1.5.32,QUEEN,"Will I first work: he's for his master,"
29006,Cymbeline,7,1.5.33,QUEEN,"An enemy to my son. How now, Pisanio!"
29007,Cymbeline,7,1.5.34,QUEEN,"Doctor, your service for this time is ended,"
29008,Cymbeline,7,1.5.35,QUEEN,Take your own way.
29009,Cymbeline,8,1.5.36,CORNELIUS,"[Aside]          I do suspect you, madam,"
29010,Cymbeline,8,1.5.37,CORNELIUS,But you shall do no harm.
29011,Cymbeline,9,1.5.38,QUEEN,"[To PISANIO]            Hark thee, a word."
29012,Cymbeline,10,1.5.39,CORNELIUS,[Aside]  I do not like her. She doth think she has
29013,Cymbeline,10,1.5.40,CORNELIUS,"Strange lingering poisons: I do know her spirit,"
29014,Cymbeline,10,1.5.41,CORNELIUS,And will not trust one of her malice with
29015,Cymbeline,10,1.5.42,CORNELIUS,A drug of such damn'd nature. Those she has
29016,Cymbeline,10,1.5.43,CORNELIUS,"Will stupefy and dull the sense awhile,"
29017,Cymbeline,10,1.5.44,CORNELIUS,"Which first, perchance, she'll prove on"
29018,Cymbeline,10,1.5.45,CORNELIUS,"cats and dogs,"
29019,Cymbeline,10,1.5.46,CORNELIUS,Then afterward up higher: but there is
29020,Cymbeline,10,1.5.47,CORNELIUS,"No danger in what show of death it makes,"
29021,Cymbeline,10,1.5.48,CORNELIUS,"More than the locking-up the spirits a time,"
29022,Cymbeline,10,1.5.49,CORNELIUS,"To be more fresh, reviving. She is fool'd"
29023,Cymbeline,10,1.5.50,CORNELIUS,"With a most false effect, and I the truer,"
29024,Cymbeline,10,1.5.51,CORNELIUS,So to be false with her.
29025,Cymbeline,11,1.5.52,QUEEN,"No further service, doctor,"
29026,Cymbeline,11,1.5.53,QUEEN,Until I send for thee.
29027,Cymbeline,12,1.5.54,CORNELIUS,I humbly take my leave.
29028,Cymbeline,12,,CORNELIUS,Exit
29029,Cymbeline,13,1.5.55,QUEEN,"Weeps she still, say'st thou? Dost thou think in time"
29030,Cymbeline,13,1.5.56,QUEEN,She will not quench and let instructions enter
29031,Cymbeline,13,1.5.57,QUEEN,Where folly now possesses? Do thou work:
29032,Cymbeline,13,1.5.58,QUEEN,"When thou shalt bring me word she loves my son,"
29033,Cymbeline,13,1.5.59,QUEEN,I'll tell thee on the instant thou art then
29034,Cymbeline,13,1.5.60,QUEEN,"As great as is thy master, greater, for"
29035,Cymbeline,13,1.5.61,QUEEN,His fortunes all lie speechless and his name
29036,Cymbeline,13,1.5.62,QUEEN,"Is at last gasp: return he cannot, nor"
29037,Cymbeline,13,1.5.63,QUEEN,Continue where he is: to shift his being
29038,Cymbeline,13,1.5.64,QUEEN,"Is to exchange one misery with another,"
29039,Cymbeline,13,1.5.65,QUEEN,And every day that comes comes to decay
29040,Cymbeline,13,1.5.66,QUEEN,"A day's work in him. What shalt thou expect,"
29041,Cymbeline,13,1.5.67,QUEEN,"To be depender on a thing that leans,"
29042,Cymbeline,13,1.5.68,QUEEN,"Who cannot be new built, nor has no friends,"
29043,Cymbeline,13,1.5.69,QUEEN,So much as but to prop him?
29044,Cymbeline,13,1.5.69,QUEEN,The QUEEN drops the box: PISANIO takes it up
29045,Cymbeline,13,1.5.70,QUEEN,Thou takest up
29046,Cymbeline,13,1.5.71,QUEEN,"Thou know'st not what, but take it for thy labour:"
29047,Cymbeline,13,1.5.72,QUEEN,"It is a thing I made, which hath the king"
29048,Cymbeline,13,1.5.73,QUEEN,Five times redeem'd from death: I do not know
29049,Cymbeline,13,1.5.74,QUEEN,"What is more cordial. Nay, I prethee, take it,"
29050,Cymbeline,13,1.5.75,QUEEN,It is an earnest of a further good
29051,Cymbeline,13,1.5.76,QUEEN,That I mean to thee. Tell thy mistress how
29052,Cymbeline,13,1.5.77,QUEEN,"The case stands with her, do't as from thyself."
29053,Cymbeline,13,1.5.78,QUEEN,"Think what a chance thou changest on, but think"
29054,Cymbeline,13,1.5.79,QUEEN,"Thou hast thy mistress still, to boot, my son,"
29055,Cymbeline,13,1.5.80,QUEEN,Who shall take notice of thee: I'll move the king
29056,Cymbeline,13,1.5.81,QUEEN,To any shape of thy preferment such
29057,Cymbeline,13,1.5.82,QUEEN,"As thou'lt desire, and then myself, I chiefly,"
29058,Cymbeline,13,1.5.83,QUEEN,"That set thee on to this desert, am bound"
29059,Cymbeline,13,1.5.84,QUEEN,To load thy merit richly. Call my women:
29060,Cymbeline,13,1.5.85,QUEEN,Think on my words.
29061,Cymbeline,13,,QUEEN,Exit PISANIO
29062,Cymbeline,13,1.5.86,QUEEN,"A sly and constant knave,"
29063,Cymbeline,13,1.5.87,QUEEN,"Not to be shaked, the agent for his master"
29064,Cymbeline,13,1.5.88,QUEEN,And the remembrancer of her to hold
29065,Cymbeline,13,1.5.89,QUEEN,The hand-fast to her lord. I have given him that
29066,Cymbeline,13,1.5.90,QUEEN,"Which, if he take, shall quite unpeople her"
29067,Cymbeline,13,1.5.91,QUEEN,"Of liegers for her sweet, and which she after,"
29068,Cymbeline,13,1.5.92,QUEEN,"Except she bend her humour, shall be assured"
29069,Cymbeline,13,1.5.93,QUEEN,To taste of too.
29070,Cymbeline,13,,QUEEN,Re-enter PISANIO and Ladies
29071,Cymbeline,13,1.5.94,QUEEN,"So, so: well done, well done:"
29072,Cymbeline,13,1.5.95,QUEEN,"The violets, cowslips, and the primroses,"
29073,Cymbeline,13,1.5.96,QUEEN,"Bear to my closet. Fare thee well, Pisanio,"
29074,Cymbeline,13,1.5.97,QUEEN,Think on my words.
29075,Cymbeline,13,,QUEEN,Exeunt QUEEN and Ladies
29076,Cymbeline,14,1.5.98,PISANIO,And shall do:
29077,Cymbeline,14,1.5.99,PISANIO,"But when to my good lord I prove untrue,"
29078,Cymbeline,14,1.5.100,PISANIO,I'll choke myself: there's all I'll do for you.
29079,Cymbeline,14,,PISANIO,Exit
29080,Cymbeline,14,,PISANIO,SCENE VI. The same. Another room in the palace.
29081,Cymbeline,14,,PISANIO,Enter IMOGEN
29082,Cymbeline,1,1.6.1,IMOGEN,"A father cruel, and a step-dame false,"
29083,Cymbeline,1,1.6.2,IMOGEN,"A foolish suitor to a wedded lady,"
29084,Cymbeline,1,1.6.3,IMOGEN,"That hath her husband banish'd,--O, that husband!"
29085,Cymbeline,1,1.6.4,IMOGEN,My supreme crown of grief! and those repeated
29086,Cymbeline,1,1.6.5,IMOGEN,"Vexations of it! Had I been thief-stol'n,"
29087,Cymbeline,1,1.6.6,IMOGEN,"As my two brothers, happy! but most miserable"
29088,Cymbeline,1,1.6.7,IMOGEN,"Is the desire that's glorious: blest be those,"
29089,Cymbeline,1,1.6.8,IMOGEN,"How mean soe'er, that have their honest wills,"
29090,Cymbeline,1,1.6.9,IMOGEN,Which seasons comfort. Who may this be? Fie!
29091,Cymbeline,1,,IMOGEN,Enter PISANIO and IACHIMO
29092,Cymbeline,2,1.6.10,PISANIO,"Madam, a noble gentleman of Rome,"
29093,Cymbeline,2,1.6.11,PISANIO,Comes from my lord with letters.
29094,Cymbeline,3,1.6.12,IACHIMO,"Change you, madam?"
29095,Cymbeline,3,1.6.13,IACHIMO,The worthy Leonatus is in safety
29096,Cymbeline,3,1.6.14,IACHIMO,And greets your highness dearly.
29097,Cymbeline,3,,IACHIMO,Presents a letter
29098,Cymbeline,4,1.6.15,IMOGEN,"Thanks, good sir:"
29099,Cymbeline,4,1.6.16,IMOGEN,You're kindly welcome.
29100,Cymbeline,5,1.6.17,IACHIMO,[Aside]  All of her that is out of door most rich!
29101,Cymbeline,5,1.6.18,IACHIMO,"If she be furnish'd with a mind so rare,"
29102,Cymbeline,5,1.6.19,IACHIMO,"She is alone the Arabian bird, and I"
29103,Cymbeline,5,1.6.20,IACHIMO,Have lost the wager. Boldness be my friend!
29104,Cymbeline,5,1.6.21,IACHIMO,"Arm me, audacity, from head to foot!"
29105,Cymbeline,5,1.6.22,IACHIMO,"Or, like the Parthian, I shall flying fight,"
29106,Cymbeline,5,1.6.23,IACHIMO,Rather directly fly.
29107,Cymbeline,6,1.6.24,IMOGEN,"[Reads]  'He is one of the noblest note, to whose"
29108,Cymbeline,6,1.6.25,IMOGEN,kindnesses I am most infinitely tied. Reflect upon
29109,Cymbeline,6,1.6.26,IMOGEN,"him accordingly, as you value your trust--"
29110,Cymbeline,6,1.6.27,IMOGEN,LEONATUS.'
29111,Cymbeline,6,1.6.28,IMOGEN,So far I read aloud:
29112,Cymbeline,6,1.6.29,IMOGEN,But even the very middle of my heart
29113,Cymbeline,6,1.6.30,IMOGEN,"Is warm'd by the rest, and takes it thankfully."
29114,Cymbeline,6,1.6.31,IMOGEN,"You are as welcome, worthy sir, as I"
29115,Cymbeline,6,1.6.32,IMOGEN,"Have words to bid you, and shall find it so"
29116,Cymbeline,6,1.6.33,IMOGEN,In all that I can do.
29117,Cymbeline,7,1.6.34,IACHIMO,"Thanks, fairest lady."
29118,Cymbeline,7,1.6.35,IACHIMO,"What, are men mad? Hath nature given them eyes"
29119,Cymbeline,7,1.6.36,IACHIMO,"To see this vaulted arch, and the rich crop"
29120,Cymbeline,7,1.6.37,IACHIMO,"Of sea and land, which can distinguish 'twixt"
29121,Cymbeline,7,1.6.38,IACHIMO,The fiery orbs above and the twinn'd stones
29122,Cymbeline,7,1.6.39,IACHIMO,Upon the number'd beach? and can we not
29123,Cymbeline,7,1.6.40,IACHIMO,Partition make with spectacles so precious
29124,Cymbeline,7,1.6.41,IACHIMO,'Twixt fair and foul?
29125,Cymbeline,8,1.6.42,IMOGEN,What makes your admiration?
29126,Cymbeline,9,1.6.43,IACHIMO,"It cannot be i' the eye, for apes and monkeys"
29127,Cymbeline,9,1.6.44,IACHIMO,'Twixt two such shes would chatter this way and
29128,Cymbeline,9,1.6.45,IACHIMO,"Contemn with mows the other, nor i' the judgment,"
29129,Cymbeline,9,1.6.46,IACHIMO,For idiots in this case of favour would
29130,Cymbeline,9,1.6.47,IACHIMO,"Be wisely definite, nor i' the appetite,"
29131,Cymbeline,9,1.6.48,IACHIMO,Sluttery to such neat excellence opposed
29132,Cymbeline,9,1.6.49,IACHIMO,"Should make desire vomit emptiness,"
29133,Cymbeline,9,1.6.50,IACHIMO,Not so allured to feed.
29134,Cymbeline,10,1.6.51,IMOGEN,"What is the matter, trow?"
29135,Cymbeline,11,1.6.52,IACHIMO,"The cloyed will,"
29136,Cymbeline,11,1.6.53,IACHIMO,"That satiate yet unsatisfied desire, that tub"
29137,Cymbeline,11,1.6.54,IACHIMO,"Both fill'd and running, ravening first the lamb"
29138,Cymbeline,11,1.6.55,IACHIMO,Longs after for the garbage.
29139,Cymbeline,12,1.6.56,IMOGEN,"What, dear sir,"
29140,Cymbeline,12,1.6.57,IMOGEN,Thus raps you? Are you well?
29141,Cymbeline,13,1.6.58,IACHIMO,"Thanks, madam, well."
29142,Cymbeline,13,,IACHIMO,To PISANIO
29143,Cymbeline,13,1.6.59,IACHIMO,"Beseech you, sir, desire"
29144,Cymbeline,13,1.6.60,IACHIMO,My man's abode where I did leave him: he
29145,Cymbeline,13,1.6.61,IACHIMO,Is strange and peevish.
29146,Cymbeline,14,1.6.62,PISANIO,"I was going, sir,"
29147,Cymbeline,14,1.6.63,PISANIO,To give him welcome.
29148,Cymbeline,14,,PISANIO,Exit
29149,Cymbeline,15,1.6.64,IMOGEN,"Continues well my lord? His health, beseech you?"
29150,Cymbeline,16,1.6.65,IACHIMO,"Well, madam."
29151,Cymbeline,17,1.6.66,IMOGEN,Is he disposed to mirth? I hope he is.
29152,Cymbeline,18,1.6.67,IACHIMO,"Exceeding pleasant, none a stranger there"
29153,Cymbeline,18,1.6.68,IACHIMO,So merry and so gamesome: he is call'd
29154,Cymbeline,18,1.6.69,IACHIMO,The Briton reveller.
29155,Cymbeline,19,1.6.70,IMOGEN,"When he was here,"
29156,Cymbeline,19,1.6.71,IMOGEN,"He did incline to sadness, and oft-times"
29157,Cymbeline,19,1.6.72,IMOGEN,Not knowing why.
29158,Cymbeline,20,1.6.73,IACHIMO,I never saw him sad.
29159,Cymbeline,20,1.6.74,IACHIMO,"There is a Frenchman his companion, one"
29160,Cymbeline,20,1.6.75,IACHIMO,"An eminent monsieur, that, it seems, much loves"
29161,Cymbeline,20,1.6.76,IACHIMO,"A Gallian girl at home, he furnaces"
29162,Cymbeline,20,1.6.77,IACHIMO,"The thick sighs from him, whiles the jolly Briton--"
29163,Cymbeline,20,1.6.78,IACHIMO,"Your lord, I mean--laughs from's free lungs, cries 'O,"
29164,Cymbeline,20,1.6.79,IACHIMO,"Can my sides hold, to think that man, who knows"
29165,Cymbeline,20,1.6.80,IACHIMO,"By history, report, or his own proof,"
29166,Cymbeline,20,1.6.81,IACHIMO,"What woman is, yea, what she cannot choose"
29167,Cymbeline,20,1.6.82,IACHIMO,"But must be, will his free hours languish for"
29168,Cymbeline,20,1.6.83,IACHIMO,Assured bondage?'
29169,Cymbeline,21,1.6.84,IMOGEN,Will my lord say so?
29170,Cymbeline,22,1.6.85,IACHIMO,"Ay, madam, with his eyes in flood with laughter:"
29171,Cymbeline,22,1.6.86,IACHIMO,It is a recreation to be by
29172,Cymbeline,22,1.6.87,IACHIMO,"And hear him mock the Frenchman. But, heavens know,"
29173,Cymbeline,22,1.6.88,IACHIMO,Some men are much to blame.
29174,Cymbeline,23,1.6.89,IMOGEN,"Not he, I hope."
29175,Cymbeline,24,1.6.90,IACHIMO,Not he: but yet heaven's bounty towards him might
29176,Cymbeline,24,1.6.91,IACHIMO,"Be used more thankfully. In himself, 'tis much,"
29177,Cymbeline,24,1.6.92,IACHIMO,"In you, which I account his beyond all talents,"
29178,Cymbeline,24,1.6.93,IACHIMO,"Whilst I am bound to wonder, I am bound"
29179,Cymbeline,24,1.6.94,IACHIMO,To pity too.
29180,Cymbeline,25,1.6.95,IMOGEN,"What do you pity, sir?"
29181,Cymbeline,26,1.6.96,IACHIMO,Two creatures heartily.
29182,Cymbeline,27,1.6.97,IMOGEN,"Am I one, sir?"
29183,Cymbeline,27,1.6.98,IMOGEN,You look on me: what wreck discern you in me
29184,Cymbeline,27,1.6.99,IMOGEN,Deserves your pity?
29185,Cymbeline,28,1.6.100,IACHIMO,"Lamentable! What,"
29186,Cymbeline,28,1.6.101,IACHIMO,To hide me from the radiant sun and solace
29187,Cymbeline,28,1.6.102,IACHIMO,I' the dungeon by a snuff?
29188,Cymbeline,29,1.6.103,IMOGEN,"I pray you, sir,"
29189,Cymbeline,29,1.6.104,IMOGEN,Deliver with more openness your answers
29190,Cymbeline,29,1.6.105,IMOGEN,To my demands. Why do you pity me?
29191,Cymbeline,30,1.6.106,IACHIMO,That others do--
29192,Cymbeline,30,1.6.107,IACHIMO,I was about to say--enjoy your--But
29193,Cymbeline,30,1.6.108,IACHIMO,"It is an office of the gods to venge it,"
29194,Cymbeline,30,1.6.109,IACHIMO,Not mine to speak on 't.
29195,Cymbeline,31,1.6.110,IMOGEN,You do seem to know
29196,Cymbeline,31,1.6.111,IMOGEN,"Something of me, or what concerns me: pray you,--"
29197,Cymbeline,31,1.6.112,IMOGEN,Since doubling things go ill often hurts more
29198,Cymbeline,31,1.6.113,IMOGEN,"Than to be sure they do, for certainties"
29199,Cymbeline,31,1.6.114,IMOGEN,"Either are past remedies, or, timely knowing,"
29200,Cymbeline,31,1.6.115,IMOGEN,The remedy then born--discover to me
29201,Cymbeline,31,1.6.116,IMOGEN,What both you spur and stop.
29202,Cymbeline,32,1.6.117,IACHIMO,Had I this cheek
29203,Cymbeline,32,1.6.118,IACHIMO,"To bathe my lips upon, this hand, whose touch,"
29204,Cymbeline,32,1.6.119,IACHIMO,"Whose every touch, would force the feeler's soul"
29205,Cymbeline,32,1.6.120,IACHIMO,"To the oath of loyalty, this object, which"
29206,Cymbeline,32,1.6.121,IACHIMO,"Takes prisoner the wild motion of mine eye,"
29207,Cymbeline,32,1.6.122,IACHIMO,"Fixing it only here, should I, damn'd then,"
29208,Cymbeline,32,1.6.123,IACHIMO,Slaver with lips as common as the stairs
29209,Cymbeline,32,1.6.124,IACHIMO,"That mount the Capitol, join gripes with hands"
29210,Cymbeline,32,1.6.125,IACHIMO,"Made hard with hourly falsehood--falsehood, as"
29211,Cymbeline,32,1.6.126,IACHIMO,"With labour, then by-peeping in an eye"
29212,Cymbeline,32,1.6.127,IACHIMO,Base and unlustrous as the smoky light
29213,Cymbeline,32,1.6.128,IACHIMO,"That's fed with stinking tallow, it were fit"
29214,Cymbeline,32,1.6.129,IACHIMO,That all the plagues of hell should at one time
29215,Cymbeline,32,1.6.130,IACHIMO,Encounter such revolt.
29216,Cymbeline,33,1.6.131,IMOGEN,"My lord, I fear,"
29217,Cymbeline,33,1.6.132,IMOGEN,Has forgot Britain.
29218,Cymbeline,34,1.6.133,IACHIMO,"And himself. Not I,"
29219,Cymbeline,34,1.6.134,IACHIMO,"Inclined to this intelligence, pronounce"
29220,Cymbeline,34,1.6.135,IACHIMO,"The beggary of his change, but 'tis your graces"
29221,Cymbeline,34,1.6.136,IACHIMO,That from pay mutest conscience to my tongue
29222,Cymbeline,34,1.6.137,IACHIMO,Charms this report out.
29223,Cymbeline,35,1.6.138,IMOGEN,Let me hear no more.
29224,Cymbeline,36,1.6.139,IACHIMO,O dearest soul! your cause doth strike my heart
29225,Cymbeline,36,1.6.140,IACHIMO,"With pity, that doth make me sick. A lady"
29226,Cymbeline,36,1.6.141,IACHIMO,"So fair, and fasten'd to an empery,"
29227,Cymbeline,36,1.6.142,IACHIMO,"Would make the great'st king double,--to be partner'd"
29228,Cymbeline,36,1.6.143,IACHIMO,With tomboys hired with that self-exhibition
29229,Cymbeline,36,1.6.144,IACHIMO,Which your own coffers yield! with diseased ventures
29230,Cymbeline,36,1.6.145,IACHIMO,That play with all infirmities for gold
29231,Cymbeline,36,1.6.146,IACHIMO,Which rottenness can lend nature! such boil'd stuff
29232,Cymbeline,36,1.6.147,IACHIMO,"As well might poison poison! Be revenged,"
29233,Cymbeline,36,1.6.148,IACHIMO,"Or she that bore you was no queen, and you"
29234,Cymbeline,36,1.6.149,IACHIMO,Recoil from your great stock.
29235,Cymbeline,37,1.6.150,IMOGEN,Revenged!
29236,Cymbeline,37,1.6.151,IMOGEN,"How should I be revenged? If this be true,--"
29237,Cymbeline,37,1.6.152,IMOGEN,As I have such a heart that both mine ears
29238,Cymbeline,37,1.6.153,IMOGEN,"Must not in haste abuse--if it be true,"
29239,Cymbeline,37,1.6.154,IMOGEN,How should I be revenged?
29240,Cymbeline,38,1.6.155,IACHIMO,Should he make me
29241,Cymbeline,38,1.6.156,IACHIMO,"Live, like Diana's priest, betwixt cold sheets,"
29242,Cymbeline,38,1.6.157,IACHIMO,"Whiles he is vaulting variable ramps,"
29243,Cymbeline,38,1.6.158,IACHIMO,"In your despite, upon your purse? Revenge it."
29244,Cymbeline,38,1.6.159,IACHIMO,"I dedicate myself to your sweet pleasure,"
29245,Cymbeline,38,1.6.160,IACHIMO,"More noble than that runagate to your bed,"
29246,Cymbeline,38,1.6.161,IACHIMO,"And will continue fast to your affection,"
29247,Cymbeline,38,1.6.162,IACHIMO,Still close as sure.
29248,Cymbeline,39,1.6.163,IMOGEN,"What, ho, Pisanio!"
29249,Cymbeline,40,1.6.164,IACHIMO,Let me my service tender on your lips.
29250,Cymbeline,41,1.6.165,IMOGEN,Away! I do condemn mine ears that have
29251,Cymbeline,41,1.6.166,IMOGEN,"So long attended thee. If thou wert honourable,"
29252,Cymbeline,41,1.6.167,IMOGEN,"Thou wouldst have told this tale for virtue, not"
29253,Cymbeline,41,1.6.168,IMOGEN,"For such an end thou seek'st,--as base as strange."
29254,Cymbeline,41,1.6.169,IMOGEN,"Thou wrong'st a gentleman, who is as far"
29255,Cymbeline,41,1.6.170,IMOGEN,"From thy report as thou from honour, and"
29256,Cymbeline,41,1.6.171,IMOGEN,Solicit'st here a lady that disdains
29257,Cymbeline,41,1.6.172,IMOGEN,"Thee and the devil alike. What ho, Pisanio!"
29258,Cymbeline,41,1.6.173,IMOGEN,The king my father shall be made acquainted
29259,Cymbeline,41,1.6.174,IMOGEN,"Of thy assault: if he shall think it fit,"
29260,Cymbeline,41,1.6.175,IMOGEN,A saucy stranger in his court to mart
29261,Cymbeline,41,1.6.176,IMOGEN,As in a Romish stew and to expound
29262,Cymbeline,41,1.6.177,IMOGEN,"His beastly mind to us, he hath a court"
29263,Cymbeline,41,1.6.178,IMOGEN,He little cares for and a daughter who
29264,Cymbeline,41,1.6.179,IMOGEN,"He not respects at all. What, ho, Pisanio!"
29265,Cymbeline,42,1.6.180,IACHIMO,O happy Leonatus! I may say
29266,Cymbeline,42,1.6.181,IACHIMO,The credit that thy lady hath of thee
29267,Cymbeline,42,1.6.182,IACHIMO,"Deserves thy trust, and thy most perfect goodness"
29268,Cymbeline,42,1.6.183,IACHIMO,Her assured credit. Blessed live you long!
29269,Cymbeline,42,1.6.184,IACHIMO,A lady to the worthiest sir that ever
29270,Cymbeline,42,1.6.185,IACHIMO,"Country call'd his! and you his mistress, only"
29271,Cymbeline,42,1.6.186,IACHIMO,For the most worthiest fit! Give me your pardon.
29272,Cymbeline,42,1.6.187,IACHIMO,"I have spoke this, to know if your affiance"
29273,Cymbeline,42,1.6.188,IACHIMO,"Were deeply rooted, and shall make your lord,"
29274,Cymbeline,42,1.6.189,IACHIMO,"That which he is, new o'er: and he is one"
29275,Cymbeline,42,1.6.190,IACHIMO,"The truest manner'd, such a holy witch"
29276,Cymbeline,42,1.6.191,IACHIMO,"That he enchants societies into him,"
29277,Cymbeline,42,1.6.192,IACHIMO,Half all men's hearts are his.
29278,Cymbeline,43,1.6.193,IMOGEN,You make amends.
29279,Cymbeline,44,1.6.194,IACHIMO,He sits 'mongst men like a descended god:
29280,Cymbeline,44,1.6.195,IACHIMO,"He hath a kind of honour sets him off,"
29281,Cymbeline,44,1.6.196,IACHIMO,"More than a mortal seeming. Be not angry,"
29282,Cymbeline,44,1.6.197,IACHIMO,"Most mighty princess, that I have adventured"
29283,Cymbeline,44,1.6.198,IACHIMO,"To try your taking a false report, which hath"
29284,Cymbeline,44,1.6.199,IACHIMO,Honour'd with confirmation your great judgment
29285,Cymbeline,44,1.6.200,IACHIMO,"In the election of a sir so rare,"
29286,Cymbeline,44,1.6.201,IACHIMO,Which you know cannot err: the love I bear him
29287,Cymbeline,44,1.6.202,IACHIMO,"Made me to fan you thus, but the gods made you,"
29288,Cymbeline,44,1.6.203,IACHIMO,"Unlike all others, chaffless. Pray, your pardon."
29289,Cymbeline,45,1.6.204,IMOGEN,"All's well, sir: take my power i' the court"
29290,Cymbeline,45,1.6.205,IMOGEN,for yours.
29291,Cymbeline,46,1.6.206,IACHIMO,My humble thanks. I had almost forgot
29292,Cymbeline,46,1.6.207,IACHIMO,"To entreat your grace but in a small request,"
29293,Cymbeline,46,1.6.208,IACHIMO,"And yet of moment to, for it concerns"
29294,Cymbeline,46,1.6.209,IACHIMO,"Your lord, myself and other noble friends,"
29295,Cymbeline,46,1.6.210,IACHIMO,Are partners in the business.
29296,Cymbeline,47,1.6.211,IMOGEN,"Pray, what is't?"
29297,Cymbeline,48,1.6.212,IACHIMO,Some dozen Romans of us and your lord--
29298,Cymbeline,48,1.6.213,IACHIMO,The best feather of our wing--have mingled sums
29299,Cymbeline,48,1.6.214,IACHIMO,To buy a present for the emperor
29300,Cymbeline,48,1.6.215,IACHIMO,"Which I, the factor for the rest, have done"
29301,Cymbeline,48,1.6.216,IACHIMO,"In France: 'tis plate of rare device, and jewels"
29302,Cymbeline,48,1.6.217,IACHIMO,"Of rich and exquisite form, their values great,"
29303,Cymbeline,48,1.6.218,IACHIMO,"And I am something curious, being strange,"
29304,Cymbeline,48,1.6.219,IACHIMO,To have them in safe stowage: may it please you
29305,Cymbeline,48,1.6.220,IACHIMO,To take them in protection?
29306,Cymbeline,49,1.6.221,IMOGEN,"Willingly,"
29307,Cymbeline,49,1.6.222,IMOGEN,And pawn mine honour for their safety: since
29308,Cymbeline,49,1.6.223,IMOGEN,"My lord hath interest in them, I will keep them"
29309,Cymbeline,49,1.6.224,IMOGEN,In my bedchamber.
29310,Cymbeline,50,1.6.225,IACHIMO,"They are in a trunk,"
29311,Cymbeline,50,1.6.226,IACHIMO,Attended by my men: I will make bold
29312,Cymbeline,50,1.6.227,IACHIMO,"To send them to you, only for this night,"
29313,Cymbeline,50,1.6.228,IACHIMO,I must aboard to-morrow.
29314,Cymbeline,51,1.6.229,IMOGEN,"O, no, no."
29315,Cymbeline,52,1.6.230,IACHIMO,"Yes, I beseech, or I shall short my word"
29316,Cymbeline,52,1.6.231,IACHIMO,By lengthening my return. From Gallia
29317,Cymbeline,52,1.6.232,IACHIMO,I cross'd the seas on purpose and on promise
29318,Cymbeline,52,1.6.233,IACHIMO,To see your grace.
29319,Cymbeline,53,1.6.234,IMOGEN,I thank you for your pains:
29320,Cymbeline,53,1.6.235,IMOGEN,But not away to-morrow!
29321,Cymbeline,54,1.6.236,IACHIMO,"O, I must, madam:"
29322,Cymbeline,54,1.6.237,IACHIMO,"Therefore I shall beseech you, if you please"
29323,Cymbeline,54,1.6.238,IACHIMO,"To greet your lord with writing, do't to-night:"
29324,Cymbeline,54,1.6.239,IACHIMO,"I have outstood my time, which is material"
29325,Cymbeline,54,1.6.240,IACHIMO,To the tender of our present.
29326,Cymbeline,55,1.6.241,IMOGEN,I will write.
29327,Cymbeline,55,1.6.242,IMOGEN,"Send your trunk to me, it shall safe be kept,"
29328,Cymbeline,55,1.6.243,IMOGEN,And truly yielded you. You're very welcome.
29329,Cymbeline,55,,IMOGEN,Exeunt
29330,Cymbeline,55,,IMOGEN,ACT II
29331,Cymbeline,55,,IMOGEN,SCENE I. Britain. Before Cymbeline's palace.
29332,Cymbeline,55,,IMOGEN,Enter CLOTEN and two Lords
29333,Cymbeline,1,2.1.1,CLOTEN,Was there ever man had such luck! when I kissed the
29334,Cymbeline,1,2.1.2,CLOTEN,"jack, upon an up-cast to be hit away! I had a"
29335,Cymbeline,1,2.1.3,CLOTEN,hundred pound on't: and then a whoreson jackanapes
29336,Cymbeline,1,2.1.4,CLOTEN,"must take me up for swearing, as if I borrowed mine"
29337,Cymbeline,1,2.1.5,CLOTEN,oaths of him and might not spend them at my pleasure.
29338,Cymbeline,2,2.1.6,First Lord,What got he by that? You have broke his pate with
29339,Cymbeline,2,2.1.7,First Lord,your bowl.
29340,Cymbeline,3,2.1.8,Second Lord,"[Aside]  If his wit had been like him that broke it,"
29341,Cymbeline,3,2.1.9,Second Lord,it would have run all out.
29342,Cymbeline,4,2.1.10,CLOTEN,"When a gentleman is disposed to swear, it is not for"
29343,Cymbeline,4,2.1.11,CLOTEN,"any standers-by to curtail his oaths, ha?"
29344,Cymbeline,5,2.1.12,Second Lord,"No my lord,"
29345,Cymbeline,5,,Second Lord,Aside
29346,Cymbeline,5,2.1.13,Second Lord,nor crop the ears of them.
29347,Cymbeline,6,2.1.14,CLOTEN,Whoreson dog! I give him satisfaction?
29348,Cymbeline,6,2.1.15,CLOTEN,Would he had been one of my rank!
29349,Cymbeline,7,2.1.16,Second Lord,[Aside]  To have smelt like a fool.
29350,Cymbeline,8,2.1.17,CLOTEN,I am not vexed more at any thing in the earth: a
29351,Cymbeline,8,2.1.18,CLOTEN,"pox on't! I had rather not be so noble as I am,"
29352,Cymbeline,8,2.1.19,CLOTEN,"they dare not fight with me, because of the queen my"
29353,Cymbeline,8,2.1.20,CLOTEN,mother: every Jack-slave hath his bellyful of
29354,Cymbeline,8,2.1.21,CLOTEN,"fighting, and I must go up and down like a cock that"
29355,Cymbeline,8,2.1.22,CLOTEN,nobody can match.
29356,Cymbeline,9,2.1.23,Second Lord,"[Aside]  You are cock and capon too, and you crow,"
29357,Cymbeline,9,2.1.24,Second Lord,"cock, with your comb on."
29358,Cymbeline,10,2.1.25,CLOTEN,Sayest thou?
29359,Cymbeline,11,2.1.26,Second Lord,It is not fit your lordship should undertake every
29360,Cymbeline,11,2.1.27,Second Lord,companion that you give offence to.
29361,Cymbeline,12,2.1.28,CLOTEN,"No, I know that: but it is fit I should commit"
29362,Cymbeline,12,2.1.29,CLOTEN,offence to my inferiors.
29363,Cymbeline,13,2.1.30,Second Lord,"Ay, it is fit for your lordship only."
29364,Cymbeline,14,2.1.31,CLOTEN,"Why, so I say."
29365,Cymbeline,15,2.1.32,First Lord,Did you hear of a stranger that's come to court to-night?
29366,Cymbeline,16,2.1.33,CLOTEN,"A stranger, and I not know on't!"
29367,Cymbeline,17,2.1.34,Second Lord,"[Aside]  He's a strange fellow himself, and knows it"
29368,Cymbeline,17,2.1.35,Second Lord,not.
29369,Cymbeline,18,2.1.36,First Lord,"There's an Italian come, and, 'tis thought, one of"
29370,Cymbeline,18,2.1.37,First Lord,Leonatus' friends.
29371,Cymbeline,19,2.1.38,CLOTEN,"Leonatus! a banished rascal, and he's another,"
29372,Cymbeline,19,2.1.39,CLOTEN,whatsoever he be. Who told you of this stranger?
29373,Cymbeline,20,2.1.40,First Lord,One of your lordship's pages.
29374,Cymbeline,21,2.1.41,CLOTEN,Is it fit I went to look upon him? is there no
29375,Cymbeline,21,2.1.42,CLOTEN,derogation in't?
29376,Cymbeline,22,2.1.43,Second Lord,"You cannot derogate, my lord."
29377,Cymbeline,23,2.1.44,CLOTEN,"Not easily, I think."
29378,Cymbeline,24,2.1.45,Second Lord,"[Aside]  You are a fool granted, therefore your"
29379,Cymbeline,24,2.1.46,Second Lord,"issues, being foolish, do not derogate."
29380,Cymbeline,25,2.1.47,CLOTEN,"Come, I'll go see this Italian: what I have lost"
29381,Cymbeline,25,2.1.48,CLOTEN,"to-day at bowls I'll win to-night of him. Come, go."
29382,Cymbeline,26,2.1.49,Second Lord,I'll attend your lordship.
29383,Cymbeline,26,,Second Lord,Exeunt CLOTEN and First Lord
29384,Cymbeline,26,2.1.50,Second Lord,That such a crafty devil as is his mother
29385,Cymbeline,26,2.1.51,Second Lord,Should yield the world this ass! a woman that
29386,Cymbeline,26,2.1.52,Second Lord,"Bears all down with her brain, and this her son"
29387,Cymbeline,26,2.1.53,Second Lord,"Cannot take two from twenty, for his heart,"
29388,Cymbeline,26,2.1.54,Second Lord,"And leave eighteen. Alas, poor princess,"
29389,Cymbeline,26,2.1.55,Second Lord,"Thou divine Imogen, what thou endurest,"
29390,Cymbeline,26,2.1.56,Second Lord,"Betwixt a father by thy step-dame govern'd,"
29391,Cymbeline,26,2.1.57,Second Lord,"A mother hourly coining plots, a wooer"
29392,Cymbeline,26,2.1.58,Second Lord,More hateful than the foul expulsion is
29393,Cymbeline,26,2.1.59,Second Lord,"Of thy dear husband, than that horrid act"
29394,Cymbeline,26,2.1.60,Second Lord,Of the divorce he'ld make! The heavens hold firm
29395,Cymbeline,26,2.1.61,Second Lord,"The walls of thy dear honour, keep unshaked"
29396,Cymbeline,26,2.1.62,Second Lord,"That temple, thy fair mind, that thou mayst stand,"
29397,Cymbeline,26,2.1.63,Second Lord,To enjoy thy banish'd lord and this great land!
29398,Cymbeline,26,,Second Lord,Exit
29399,Cymbeline,26,,Second Lord,SCENE II. Imogen's bedchamber in Cymbeline's palace:
29400,Cymbeline,26,2.2.1,Second Lord,a trunk in one corner of it.
29401,Cymbeline,26,2.2.1,Second Lord,"IMOGEN in bed, reading, a Lady attending"
29402,Cymbeline,1,2.2.2,IMOGEN,Who's there? my woman Helen?
29403,Cymbeline,2,2.2.3,Lady,"Please you, madam"
29404,Cymbeline,3,2.2.4,IMOGEN,What hour is it?
29405,Cymbeline,4,2.2.5,Lady,"Almost midnight, madam."
29406,Cymbeline,5,2.2.6,IMOGEN,I have read three hours then: mine eyes are weak:
29407,Cymbeline,5,2.2.7,IMOGEN,Fold down the leaf where I have left: to bed:
29408,Cymbeline,5,2.2.8,IMOGEN,"Take not away the taper, leave it burning,"
29409,Cymbeline,5,2.2.9,IMOGEN,"And if thou canst awake by four o' the clock,"
29410,Cymbeline,5,2.2.10,IMOGEN,"I prithee, call me. Sleep hath seized me wholly"
29411,Cymbeline,5,,IMOGEN,Exit Lady
29412,Cymbeline,5,2.2.11,IMOGEN,"To your protection I commend me, gods."
29413,Cymbeline,5,2.2.12,IMOGEN,From fairies and the tempters of the night
29414,Cymbeline,5,2.2.13,IMOGEN,"Guard me, beseech ye."

29416,Cymbeline,6,2.2.14,IACHIMO,"The crickets sing, and man's o'er-labour'd sense"
29417,Cymbeline,6,2.2.15,IACHIMO,Repairs itself by rest. Our Tarquin thus
29418,Cymbeline,6,2.2.16,IACHIMO,"Did softly press the rushes, ere he waken'd"
29419,Cymbeline,6,2.2.17,IACHIMO,"The chastity he wounded. Cytherea,"
29420,Cymbeline,6,2.2.18,IACHIMO,"How bravely thou becomest thy bed, fresh lily,"
29421,Cymbeline,6,2.2.19,IACHIMO,And whiter than the sheets! That I might touch!
29422,Cymbeline,6,2.2.20,IACHIMO,"But kiss, one kiss! Rubies unparagon'd,"
29423,Cymbeline,6,2.2.21,IACHIMO,How dearly they do't! 'Tis her breathing that
29424,Cymbeline,6,2.2.22,IACHIMO,Perfumes the chamber thus: the flame o' the taper
29425,Cymbeline,6,2.2.23,IACHIMO,"Bows toward her, and would under-peep her lids,"
29426,Cymbeline,6,2.2.24,IACHIMO,"To see the enclosed lights, now canopied"
29427,Cymbeline,6,2.2.25,IACHIMO,"Under these windows, white and azure laced"
29428,Cymbeline,6,2.2.26,IACHIMO,"With blue of heaven's own tinct. But my design,"
29429,Cymbeline,6,2.2.27,IACHIMO,To note the chamber: I will write all down:
29430,Cymbeline,6,2.2.28,IACHIMO,"Such and such pictures, there the window, such"
29431,Cymbeline,6,2.2.29,IACHIMO,"The adornment of her bed, the arras, figures,"
29432,Cymbeline,6,2.2.30,IACHIMO,"Why, such and such, and the contents o' the story."
29433,Cymbeline,6,2.2.31,IACHIMO,"Ah, but some natural notes about her body,"
29434,Cymbeline,6,2.2.32,IACHIMO,Above ten thousand meaner moveables
29435,Cymbeline,6,2.2.33,IACHIMO,"Would testify, to enrich mine inventory."
29436,Cymbeline,6,2.2.34,IACHIMO,"O sleep, thou ape of death, lie dull upon her!"
29437,Cymbeline,6,2.2.35,IACHIMO,"And be her sense but as a monument,"
29438,Cymbeline,6,2.2.36,IACHIMO,"Thus in a chapel lying! Come off, come off:"
29439,Cymbeline,6,,IACHIMO,Taking off her bracelet
29440,Cymbeline,6,2.2.37,IACHIMO,As slippery as the Gordian knot was hard!
29441,Cymbeline,6,2.2.38,IACHIMO,"'Tis mine, and this will witness outwardly,"
29442,Cymbeline,6,2.2.39,IACHIMO,"As strongly as the conscience does within,"
29443,Cymbeline,6,2.2.40,IACHIMO,To the madding of her lord. On her left breast
29444,Cymbeline,6,2.2.41,IACHIMO,"A mole cinque-spotted, like the crimson drops"
29445,Cymbeline,6,2.2.42,IACHIMO,"I' the bottom of a cowslip: here's a voucher,"
29446,Cymbeline,6,2.2.43,IACHIMO,Stronger than ever law could make: this secret
29447,Cymbeline,6,2.2.44,IACHIMO,Will force him think I have pick'd the lock and ta'en
29448,Cymbeline,6,2.2.45,IACHIMO,The treasure of her honour. No more. To what end?
29449,Cymbeline,6,2.2.46,IACHIMO,"Why should I write this down, that's riveted,"
29450,Cymbeline,6,2.2.47,IACHIMO,Screw'd to my memory? She hath been reading late
29451,Cymbeline,6,2.2.48,IACHIMO,"The tale of Tereus, here the leaf's turn'd down"
29452,Cymbeline,6,2.2.49,IACHIMO,Where Philomel gave up. I have enough:
29453,Cymbeline,6,2.2.50,IACHIMO,"To the trunk again, and shut the spring of it."
29454,Cymbeline,6,2.2.51,IACHIMO,"Swift, swift, you dragons of the night, that dawning"

29456,Cymbeline,6,2.2.53,IACHIMO,"Though this a heavenly angel, hell is here."
29457,Cymbeline,6,,IACHIMO,Clock strikes
29458,Cymbeline,6,2.2.54,IACHIMO,"One, two, three: time, time!"

29460,Cymbeline,7,2.2.55,,An ante-chamber adjoining Imogen's apartments.

29463,Cymbeline,8,2.2.57,First Lord,most coldest that ever turned up ace.
29464,Cymbeline,9,2.2.58,CLOTEN,It would make any man cold to lose.
29465,Cymbeline,10,2.2.59,First Lord,But not every man patient after the noble temper of
29466,Cymbeline,10,2.2.60,First Lord,your lordship. You are most hot and furious when you win.
29467,Cymbeline,11,2.2.61,CLOTEN,Winning will put any man into courage. If I could
29468,Cymbeline,11,2.2.62,CLOTEN,"get this foolish Imogen, I should have gold enough."
29469,Cymbeline,11,2.2.63,CLOTEN,"It's almost morning, is't not?"
29470,Cymbeline,12,2.2.64,First Lord,"Day, my lord."
29471,Cymbeline,13,2.2.65,CLOTEN,I would this music would come: I am advised to give
29472,Cymbeline,13,2.2.66,CLOTEN,"her music o' mornings, they say it will penetrate."
29473,Cymbeline,13,,CLOTEN,Enter Musicians
29474,Cymbeline,13,2.2.67,CLOTEN,"Come on, tune: if you can penetrate her with your"
29475,Cymbeline,13,2.2.68,CLOTEN,"fingering, so, we'll try with tongue too: if none"
29476,Cymbeline,13,2.2.69,CLOTEN,"will do, let her remain, but I'll never give o'er."
29477,Cymbeline,13,2.2.70,CLOTEN,"First, a very excellent good-conceited thing,"
29478,Cymbeline,13,2.2.71,CLOTEN,"after, a wonderful sweet air, with admirable rich"
29479,Cymbeline,13,2.2.72,CLOTEN,words to it: and then let her consider.

29490,Cymbeline,14,2.2.82,CLOTEN,"So, get you gone. If this penetrate, I will"
29491,Cymbeline,14,2.2.83,CLOTEN,"consider your music the better: if it do not, it is"
29492,Cymbeline,14,2.2.84,CLOTEN,"a vice in her ears, which horse-hairs and"

29498,Cymbeline,16,2.2.89,CLOTEN,was up so early: he cannot choose but take this
29499,Cymbeline,16,2.2.90,CLOTEN,service I have done fatherly.
29500,Cymbeline,16,,CLOTEN,Enter CYMBELINE and QUEEN
29501,Cymbeline,16,2.2.91,CLOTEN,Good morrow to your majesty and to my gracious mother.
29502,Cymbeline,17,2.2.92,CYMBELINE,Attend you here the door of our stern daughter?
29503,Cymbeline,17,2.2.93,CYMBELINE,Will she not forth?
29504,Cymbeline,18,2.2.94,CLOTEN,"I have assailed her with music, but she vouchsafes no notice."
29505,Cymbeline,19,2.2.95,CYMBELINE,"The exile of her minion is too new,"
29506,Cymbeline,19,2.2.96,CYMBELINE,She hath not yet forgot him: some more time
29507,Cymbeline,19,2.2.97,CYMBELINE,"Must wear the print of his remembrance out,"
29508,Cymbeline,19,2.2.98,CYMBELINE,And then she's yours.
29509,Cymbeline,20,2.2.99,QUEEN,"You are most bound to the king,"
29510,Cymbeline,20,2.2.100,QUEEN,Who lets go by no vantages that may
29511,Cymbeline,20,2.2.101,QUEEN,Prefer you to his daughter. Frame yourself

29515,Cymbeline,20,2.2.105,QUEEN,You were inspired to do those duties which

29517,Cymbeline,20,2.2.107,QUEEN,"Save when command to your dismission tends,"
29518,Cymbeline,20,2.2.108,QUEEN,And therein you are senseless.
29519,Cymbeline,21,2.2.109,CLOTEN,Senseless! not so.
29520,Cymbeline,21,,CLOTEN,Enter a Messenger
29521,Cymbeline,22,2.2.110,Messenger,"So like you, sir, ambassadors from Rome,"
29522,Cymbeline,22,2.2.111,Messenger,The one is Caius Lucius.
29523,Cymbeline,23,2.2.112,CYMBELINE,"A worthy fellow,"
29524,Cymbeline,23,2.2.113,CYMBELINE,"Albeit he comes on angry purpose now,"
29525,Cymbeline,23,2.2.114,CYMBELINE,But that's no fault of his: we must receive him
29526,Cymbeline,23,2.2.115,CYMBELINE,"According to the honour of his sender,"
29527,Cymbeline,23,2.2.116,CYMBELINE,"And towards himself, his goodness forespent on us,"

29529,Cymbeline,23,2.2.118,CYMBELINE,"When you have given good morning to your mistress,"
29530,Cymbeline,23,2.2.119,CYMBELINE,"Attend the queen and us, we shall have need"
29531,Cymbeline,23,2.2.120,CYMBELINE,"To employ you towards this Roman. Come, our queen."

29535,Cymbeline,24,,CLOTEN,Knocks
29536,Cymbeline,24,2.2.123,CLOTEN,"By your leave, ho!"
29537,Cymbeline,24,2.2.124,CLOTEN,I Know her women are about her: what
29538,Cymbeline,24,2.2.125,CLOTEN,If I do line one of their hands? 'Tis gold
29539,Cymbeline,24,2.2.126,CLOTEN,"Which buys admittance, oft it doth, yea, and makes"
29540,Cymbeline,24,2.2.127,CLOTEN,"Diana's rangers false themselves, yield up"
29541,Cymbeline,24,2.2.128,CLOTEN,"Their deer to the stand o' the stealer, and 'tis gold"
29542,Cymbeline,24,2.2.129,CLOTEN,"Which makes the true man kill'd and saves the thief,"
29543,Cymbeline,24,2.2.130,CLOTEN,"Nay, sometime hangs both thief and true man: what"
29544,Cymbeline,24,2.2.131,CLOTEN,Can it not do and undo? I will make
29545,Cymbeline,24,2.2.132,CLOTEN,"One of her women lawyer to me, for"
29546,Cymbeline,24,2.2.133,CLOTEN,I yet not understand the case myself.
29547,Cymbeline,24,,CLOTEN,Knocks
29548,Cymbeline,24,2.2.134,CLOTEN,By your leave.
29549,Cymbeline,24,,CLOTEN,Enter a Lady
29550,Cymbeline,25,2.2.135,Lady,Who's there that knocks?
29551,Cymbeline,26,2.2.136,CLOTEN,A gentleman.
29552,Cymbeline,27,2.2.137,Lady,No more?
29553,Cymbeline,28,2.2.138,CLOTEN,"Yes, and a gentlewoman's son."
29554,Cymbeline,29,2.2.139,Lady,That's more
29555,Cymbeline,29,2.2.140,Lady,"Than some, whose tailors are as dear as yours,"
29556,Cymbeline,29,2.2.141,Lady,Can justly boast of. What's your lordship's pleasure?
29557,Cymbeline,30,2.2.142,CLOTEN,Your lady's person: is she ready?
29558,Cymbeline,31,2.2.143,Lady,"Ay,"
29559,Cymbeline,31,2.2.144,Lady,To keep her chamber.
29560,Cymbeline,32,2.2.145,CLOTEN,"There is gold for you,"
29561,Cymbeline,32,2.2.146,CLOTEN,Sell me your good report.
29562,Cymbeline,33,2.2.147,Lady,How! my good name? or to report of you
29563,Cymbeline,33,2.2.148,Lady,What I shall think is good?--The princess!
29564,Cymbeline,33,,Lady,Enter IMOGEN
29565,Cymbeline,34,2.2.149,CLOTEN,"Good morrow, fairest: sister, your sweet hand."
29566,Cymbeline,34,,CLOTEN,Exit Lady
29567,Cymbeline,35,2.2.150,IMOGEN,"Good morrow, sir. You lay out too much pains"
29568,Cymbeline,35,2.2.151,IMOGEN,"For purchasing but trouble, the thanks I give"
29569,Cymbeline,35,2.2.152,IMOGEN,Is telling you that I am poor of thanks
29570,Cymbeline,35,2.2.153,IMOGEN,And scarce can spare them.
29571,Cymbeline,36,2.2.154,CLOTEN,"Still, I swear I love you."
29572,Cymbeline,37,2.2.155,IMOGEN,"If you but said so, 'twere as deep with me:"
29573,Cymbeline,37,2.2.156,IMOGEN,"If you swear still, your recompense is still"
29574,Cymbeline,37,2.2.157,IMOGEN,That I regard it not.
29575,Cymbeline,38,2.2.158,CLOTEN,This is no answer.
29576,Cymbeline,39,2.2.159,IMOGEN,"But that you shall not say I yield being silent,"
29577,Cymbeline,39,2.2.160,IMOGEN,"I would not speak. I pray you, spare me: 'faith,"
29578,Cymbeline,39,2.2.161,IMOGEN,I shall unfold equal discourtesy
29579,Cymbeline,39,2.2.162,IMOGEN,To your best kindness: one of your great knowing
29580,Cymbeline,39,2.2.163,IMOGEN,"Should learn, being taught, forbearance."
29581,Cymbeline,40,2.2.164,CLOTEN,"To leave you in your madness, 'twere my sin:"
29582,Cymbeline,40,2.2.165,CLOTEN,I will not.
29583,Cymbeline,41,2.2.166,IMOGEN,Fools are not mad folks.
29584,Cymbeline,42,2.2.167,CLOTEN,Do you call me fool?
29585,Cymbeline,43,2.2.168,IMOGEN,"As I am mad, I do:"
29586,Cymbeline,43,2.2.169,IMOGEN,"If you'll be patient, I'll no more be mad,"
29587,Cymbeline,43,2.2.170,IMOGEN,"That cures us both. I am much sorry, sir,"
29588,Cymbeline,43,2.2.171,IMOGEN,"You put me to forget a lady's manners,"
29589,Cymbeline,43,2.2.172,IMOGEN,"By being so verbal: and learn now, for all,"
29590,Cymbeline,43,2.2.173,IMOGEN,"That I, which know my heart, do here pronounce,"
29591,Cymbeline,43,2.2.174,IMOGEN,"By the very truth of it, I care not for you,"
29592,Cymbeline,43,2.2.175,IMOGEN,And am so near the lack of charity--
29593,Cymbeline,43,2.2.176,IMOGEN,"To accuse myself--I hate you, which I had rather"
29594,Cymbeline,43,2.2.177,IMOGEN,You felt than make't my boast.
29595,Cymbeline,44,2.2.178,CLOTEN,You sin against
29596,Cymbeline,44,2.2.179,CLOTEN,"Obedience, which you owe your father. For"
29597,Cymbeline,44,2.2.180,CLOTEN,"The contract you pretend with that base wretch,"
29598,Cymbeline,44,2.2.181,CLOTEN,"One bred of alms and foster'd with cold dishes,"
29599,Cymbeline,44,2.2.182,CLOTEN,"With scraps o' the court, it is no contract, none:"
29600,Cymbeline,44,2.2.183,CLOTEN,And though it be allow'd in meaner parties--
29601,Cymbeline,44,2.2.184,CLOTEN,"Yet who than he more mean?--to knit their souls,"
29602,Cymbeline,44,2.2.185,CLOTEN,On whom there is no more dependency
29603,Cymbeline,44,2.2.186,CLOTEN,"But brats and beggary, in self-figured knot,"
29604,Cymbeline,44,2.2.187,CLOTEN,Yet you are curb'd from that enlargement by
29605,Cymbeline,44,2.2.188,CLOTEN,"The consequence o' the crown, and must not soil"
29606,Cymbeline,44,2.2.189,CLOTEN,The precious note of it with a base slave.
29607,Cymbeline,44,2.2.190,CLOTEN,"A hilding for a livery, a squire's cloth,"
29608,Cymbeline,44,2.2.191,CLOTEN,"A pantler, not so eminent."
29609,Cymbeline,45,2.2.192,IMOGEN,Profane fellow
29610,Cymbeline,45,2.2.193,IMOGEN,Wert thou the son of Jupiter and no more
29611,Cymbeline,45,2.2.194,IMOGEN,"But what thou art besides, thou wert too base"
29612,Cymbeline,45,2.2.195,IMOGEN,"To be his groom: thou wert dignified enough,"
29613,Cymbeline,45,2.2.196,IMOGEN,"Even to the point of envy, if 'twere made"
29614,Cymbeline,45,2.2.197,IMOGEN,"Comparative for your virtues, to be styled"
29615,Cymbeline,45,2.2.198,IMOGEN,"The under-hangman of his kingdom, and hated"
29616,Cymbeline,45,2.2.199,IMOGEN,For being preferred so well.
29617,Cymbeline,46,2.2.200,CLOTEN,The south-fog rot him!
29618,Cymbeline,47,2.2.201,IMOGEN,He never can meet more mischance than come
29619,Cymbeline,47,2.2.202,IMOGEN,"To be but named of thee. His meanest garment,"
29620,Cymbeline,47,2.2.203,IMOGEN,"That ever hath but clipp'd his body, is dearer"
29621,Cymbeline,47,2.2.204,IMOGEN,"In my respect than all the hairs above thee,"
29622,Cymbeline,47,2.2.205,IMOGEN,"Were they all made such men. How now, Pisanio!"
29623,Cymbeline,47,,IMOGEN,Enter PISANIO
29624,Cymbeline,48,2.2.206,CLOTEN,'His garment!' Now the devil--
29625,Cymbeline,49,2.2.207,IMOGEN,To Dorothy my woman hie thee presently--
29626,Cymbeline,50,2.2.208,CLOTEN,'His garment!'
29627,Cymbeline,51,2.2.209,IMOGEN,I am sprited with a fool.
29628,Cymbeline,51,2.2.210,IMOGEN,"Frighted, and anger'd worse: go bid my woman"
29629,Cymbeline,51,2.2.211,IMOGEN,Search for a jewel that too casually
29630,Cymbeline,51,2.2.212,IMOGEN,"Hath left mine arm: it was thy master's: 'shrew me,"
29631,Cymbeline,51,2.2.213,IMOGEN,If I would lose it for a revenue
29632,Cymbeline,51,2.2.214,IMOGEN,Of any king's in Europe. I do think
29633,Cymbeline,51,2.2.215,IMOGEN,I saw't this morning: confident I am
29634,Cymbeline,51,2.2.216,IMOGEN,"Last night 'twas on mine arm, I kiss'd it:"
29635,Cymbeline,51,2.2.217,IMOGEN,I hope it be not gone to tell my lord
29636,Cymbeline,51,2.2.218,IMOGEN,That I kiss aught but he.

29638,Cymbeline,53,2.2.220,IMOGEN,I hope so: go and search.
29639,Cymbeline,53,,IMOGEN,Exit PISANIO
29640,Cymbeline,54,2.2.221,CLOTEN,You have abused me:
29641,Cymbeline,54,2.2.222,CLOTEN,'His meanest garment!'
29642,Cymbeline,55,2.2.223,IMOGEN,"Ay, I said so, sir:"
29643,Cymbeline,55,2.2.224,IMOGEN,"If you will make't an action, call witness to't."
29644,Cymbeline,56,2.2.225,CLOTEN,I will inform your father.
29645,Cymbeline,57,2.2.226,IMOGEN,Your mother too:
29646,Cymbeline,57,2.2.227,IMOGEN,"She's my good lady, and will conceive, I hope,"
29647,Cymbeline,57,2.2.228,IMOGEN,"But the worst of me. So, I leave you, sir,"
29648,Cymbeline,57,2.2.229,IMOGEN,To the worst of discontent.
29649,Cymbeline,57,,IMOGEN,Exit
29650,Cymbeline,58,2.2.230,CLOTEN,I'll be revenged:
29651,Cymbeline,58,2.2.231,CLOTEN,'His meanest garment!' Well.
29652,Cymbeline,58,,CLOTEN,Exit
29653,Cymbeline,58,2.2.232,CLOTEN,CYMBELINE
29654,Cymbeline,58,2.2.232,CLOTEN,SCENE IV. Rome. Philario's house.
29655,Cymbeline,58,,CLOTEN,Enter POSTHUMUS and PHILARIO
29656,Cymbeline,1,2.4.1,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Fear it not, sir: I would I were so sure"
29657,Cymbeline,1,2.4.2,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,To win the king as I am bold her honour
29658,Cymbeline,1,2.4.3,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,Will remain hers.
29659,Cymbeline,2,2.4.4,PHILARIO,What means do you make to him?
29660,Cymbeline,3,2.4.5,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Not any, but abide the change of time,"
29661,Cymbeline,3,2.4.6,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,Quake in the present winter's state and wish
29662,Cymbeline,3,2.4.7,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"That warmer days would come: in these sear'd hopes,"
29663,Cymbeline,3,2.4.8,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"I barely gratify your love, they failing,"
29664,Cymbeline,3,2.4.9,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,I must die much your debtor.
29665,Cymbeline,4,2.4.10,PHILARIO,Your very goodness and your company
29666,Cymbeline,4,2.4.11,PHILARIO,"O'erpays all I can do. By this, your king"
29667,Cymbeline,4,2.4.12,PHILARIO,Hath heard of great Augustus: Caius Lucius
29668,Cymbeline,4,2.4.13,PHILARIO,Will do's commission throughly: and I think
29669,Cymbeline,4,2.4.14,PHILARIO,"He'll grant the tribute, send the arrearages,"
29670,Cymbeline,4,2.4.15,PHILARIO,"Or look upon our Romans, whose remembrance"
29671,Cymbeline,4,2.4.16,PHILARIO,Is yet fresh in their grief.
29672,Cymbeline,5,2.4.17,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"I do believe,"
29673,Cymbeline,5,2.4.18,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Statist though I am none, nor like to be,"
29674,Cymbeline,5,2.4.19,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"That this will prove a war, and you shall hear"
29675,Cymbeline,5,2.4.20,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,The legions now in Gallia sooner landed
29676,Cymbeline,5,2.4.21,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,In our not-fearing Britain than have tidings
29677,Cymbeline,5,2.4.22,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,Of any penny tribute paid. Our countrymen
29678,Cymbeline,5,2.4.23,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,Are men more order'd than when Julius Caesar
29679,Cymbeline,5,2.4.24,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Smiled at their lack of skill, but found"
29680,Cymbeline,5,2.4.25,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,their courage
29681,Cymbeline,5,2.4.26,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Worthy his frowning at: their discipline,"
29682,Cymbeline,5,2.4.27,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Now mingled with their courages, will make known"
29683,Cymbeline,5,2.4.28,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,To their approvers they are people such
29684,Cymbeline,5,2.4.29,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,That mend upon the world.
29685,Cymbeline,5,,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,Enter IACHIMO
29686,Cymbeline,6,2.4.30,PHILARIO,See! Iachimo!
29687,Cymbeline,7,2.4.31,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"The swiftest harts have posted you by land,"
29688,Cymbeline,7,2.4.32,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"And winds of all the comers kiss'd your sails,"
29689,Cymbeline,7,2.4.33,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,To make your vessel nimble.
29690,Cymbeline,8,2.4.34,PHILARIO,"Welcome, sir."
29691,Cymbeline,9,2.4.35,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,I hope the briefness of your answer made
29692,Cymbeline,9,2.4.36,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,The speediness of your return.
29693,Cymbeline,10,2.4.37,IACHIMO,Your lady
29694,Cymbeline,10,2.4.38,IACHIMO,Is one of the fairest that I have look'd upon.
29695,Cymbeline,11,2.4.39,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"And therewithal the best, or let her beauty"
29696,Cymbeline,11,2.4.40,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,Look through a casement to allure false hearts
29697,Cymbeline,11,2.4.41,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,And be false with them.
29698,Cymbeline,12,2.4.42,IACHIMO,Here are letters for you.
29699,Cymbeline,13,2.4.43,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Their tenor good, I trust."
29700,Cymbeline,14,2.4.44,IACHIMO,'Tis very like.
29701,Cymbeline,15,2.4.45,PHILARIO,Was Caius Lucius in the Britain court
29702,Cymbeline,15,2.4.46,PHILARIO,When you were there?
29703,Cymbeline,16,2.4.47,IACHIMO,"He was expected then,"
29704,Cymbeline,16,2.4.48,IACHIMO,But not approach'd.
29705,Cymbeline,17,2.4.49,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,All is well yet.
29706,Cymbeline,17,2.4.50,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,Sparkles this stone as it was wont? or is't not
29707,Cymbeline,17,2.4.51,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,Too dull for your good wearing?
29708,Cymbeline,18,2.4.52,IACHIMO,"If I had lost it,"
29709,Cymbeline,18,2.4.53,IACHIMO,I should have lost the worth of it in gold.
29710,Cymbeline,18,2.4.54,IACHIMO,"I'll make a journey twice as far, to enjoy"
29711,Cymbeline,18,2.4.55,IACHIMO,A second night of such sweet shortness which
29712,Cymbeline,18,2.4.56,IACHIMO,"Was mine in Britain, for the ring is won."
29713,Cymbeline,19,2.4.57,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,The stone's too hard to come by.
29714,Cymbeline,20,2.4.58,IACHIMO,"Not a whit,"
29715,Cymbeline,20,2.4.59,IACHIMO,Your lady being so easy.
29716,Cymbeline,21,2.4.60,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Make not, sir,"
29717,Cymbeline,21,2.4.61,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,Your loss your sport: I hope you know that we
29718,Cymbeline,21,2.4.62,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,Must not continue friends.
29719,Cymbeline,22,2.4.63,IACHIMO,"Good sir, we must,"
29720,Cymbeline,22,2.4.64,IACHIMO,If you keep covenant. Had I not brought
29721,Cymbeline,22,2.4.65,IACHIMO,"The knowledge of your mistress home, I grant"
29722,Cymbeline,22,2.4.66,IACHIMO,We were to question further: but I now
29723,Cymbeline,22,2.4.67,IACHIMO,"Profess myself the winner of her honour,"
29724,Cymbeline,22,2.4.68,IACHIMO,"Together with your ring, and not the wronger"
29725,Cymbeline,22,2.4.69,IACHIMO,"Of her or you, having proceeded but"
29726,Cymbeline,22,2.4.70,IACHIMO,By both your wills.
29727,Cymbeline,23,2.4.71,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,If you can make't apparent
29728,Cymbeline,23,2.4.72,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"That you have tasted her in bed, my hand"
29729,Cymbeline,23,2.4.73,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"And ring is yours, if not, the foul opinion"
29730,Cymbeline,23,2.4.74,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,You had of her pure honour gains or loses
29731,Cymbeline,23,2.4.75,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Your sword or mine, or masterless leaves both"
29732,Cymbeline,23,2.4.76,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,To who shall find them.
29733,Cymbeline,24,2.4.77,IACHIMO,"Sir, my circumstances,"
29734,Cymbeline,24,2.4.78,IACHIMO,"Being so near the truth as I will make them,"
29735,Cymbeline,24,2.4.79,IACHIMO,Must first induce you to believe: whose strength
29736,Cymbeline,24,2.4.80,IACHIMO,"I will confirm with oath, which, I doubt not,"
29737,Cymbeline,24,2.4.81,IACHIMO,"You'll give me leave to spare, when you shall find"
29738,Cymbeline,24,2.4.82,IACHIMO,You need it not.
29739,Cymbeline,25,2.4.83,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,Proceed.
29740,Cymbeline,26,2.4.84,IACHIMO,"First, her bedchamber,--"
29741,Cymbeline,26,2.4.85,IACHIMO,"Where, I confess, I slept not, but profess"
29742,Cymbeline,26,2.4.86,IACHIMO,Had that was well worth watching--it was hang'd
29743,Cymbeline,26,2.4.87,IACHIMO,"With tapesty of silk and silver, the story"
29744,Cymbeline,26,2.4.88,IACHIMO,"Proud Cleopatra, when she met her Roman,"
29745,Cymbeline,26,2.4.89,IACHIMO,"And Cydnus swell'd above the banks, or for"
29746,Cymbeline,26,2.4.90,IACHIMO,The press of boats or pride: a piece of work
29747,Cymbeline,26,2.4.91,IACHIMO,"So bravely done, so rich, that it did strive"
29748,Cymbeline,26,2.4.92,IACHIMO,"In workmanship and value, which I wonder'd"
29749,Cymbeline,26,2.4.93,IACHIMO,"Could be so rarely and exactly wrought,"
29750,Cymbeline,26,2.4.94,IACHIMO,Since the true life on't was--
29751,Cymbeline,27,2.4.95,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"This is true,"
29752,Cymbeline,27,2.4.96,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"And this you might have heard of here, by me,"
29753,Cymbeline,27,2.4.97,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,Or by some other.
29754,Cymbeline,28,2.4.98,IACHIMO,More particulars
29755,Cymbeline,28,2.4.99,IACHIMO,Must justify my knowledge.
29756,Cymbeline,29,2.4.100,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"So they must,"
29757,Cymbeline,29,2.4.101,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,Or do your honour injury.
29758,Cymbeline,30,2.4.102,IACHIMO,The chimney
29759,Cymbeline,30,2.4.103,IACHIMO,"Is south the chamber, and the chimney-piece"
29760,Cymbeline,30,2.4.104,IACHIMO,Chaste Dian bathing: never saw I figures
29761,Cymbeline,30,2.4.105,IACHIMO,So likely to report themselves: the cutter
29762,Cymbeline,30,2.4.106,IACHIMO,"Was as another nature, dumb, outwent her,"
29763,Cymbeline,30,2.4.107,IACHIMO,Motion and breath left out.
29764,Cymbeline,31,2.4.108,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,This is a thing
29765,Cymbeline,31,2.4.109,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Which you might from relation likewise reap,"
29766,Cymbeline,31,2.4.110,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Being, as it is, much spoke of."
29767,Cymbeline,32,2.4.111,IACHIMO,The roof o' the chamber
29768,Cymbeline,32,2.4.112,IACHIMO,With golden cherubins is fretted: her andirons--
29769,Cymbeline,32,2.4.113,IACHIMO,I had forgot them--were two winking Cupids
29770,Cymbeline,32,2.4.114,IACHIMO,"Of silver, each on one foot standing, nicely"
29771,Cymbeline,32,2.4.115,IACHIMO,Depending on their brands.
29772,Cymbeline,33,2.4.116,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,This is her honour!
29773,Cymbeline,33,2.4.117,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,Let it be granted you have seen all this--and praise
29774,Cymbeline,33,2.4.118,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,Be given to your remembrance--the description
29775,Cymbeline,33,2.4.119,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,Of what is in her chamber nothing saves
29776,Cymbeline,33,2.4.120,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,The wager you have laid.
29777,Cymbeline,34,2.4.121,IACHIMO,"Then, if you can,"
29778,Cymbeline,34,,IACHIMO,Showing the bracelet
29779,Cymbeline,34,2.4.122,IACHIMO,"Be pale: I beg but leave to air this jewel, see!"
29780,Cymbeline,34,2.4.123,IACHIMO,And now 'tis up again: it must be married
29781,Cymbeline,34,2.4.124,IACHIMO,"To that your diamond, I'll keep them."
29782,Cymbeline,35,2.4.125,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,Jove!
29783,Cymbeline,35,2.4.126,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,Once more let me behold it: is it that
29784,Cymbeline,35,2.4.127,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,Which I left with her?
29785,Cymbeline,36,2.4.128,IACHIMO,Sir--I thank her--that:
29786,Cymbeline,36,2.4.129,IACHIMO,"She stripp'd it from her arm, I see her yet,"
29787,Cymbeline,36,2.4.130,IACHIMO,"Her pretty action did outsell her gift,"
29788,Cymbeline,36,2.4.131,IACHIMO,"And yet enrich'd it too: she gave it me, and said"
29789,Cymbeline,36,2.4.132,IACHIMO,She prized it once.
29790,Cymbeline,37,2.4.133,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,May be she pluck'd it off
29791,Cymbeline,37,2.4.134,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,To send it me.
29792,Cymbeline,38,2.4.135,IACHIMO,"She writes so to you, doth she?"
29793,Cymbeline,39,2.4.136,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"O, no, no, no! 'tis true. Here, take this too,"
29794,Cymbeline,39,,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,Gives the ring
29795,Cymbeline,39,2.4.137,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"It is a basilisk unto mine eye,"
29796,Cymbeline,39,2.4.138,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,Kills me to look on't. Let there be no honour
29797,Cymbeline,39,2.4.139,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Where there is beauty, truth, where semblance, love,"
29798,Cymbeline,39,2.4.140,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,Where there's another man: the vows of women
29799,Cymbeline,39,2.4.141,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Of no more bondage be, to where they are made,"
29800,Cymbeline,39,2.4.142,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Than they are to their virtues, which is nothing."
29801,Cymbeline,39,2.4.143,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"O, above measure false!"
29802,Cymbeline,40,2.4.144,PHILARIO,"Have patience, sir,"
29803,Cymbeline,40,2.4.145,PHILARIO,"And take your ring again, 'tis not yet won:"
29804,Cymbeline,40,2.4.146,PHILARIO,"It may be probable she lost it, or"
29805,Cymbeline,40,2.4.147,PHILARIO,"Who knows if one of her women, being corrupted,"
29806,Cymbeline,40,2.4.148,PHILARIO,Hath stol'n it from her?
29807,Cymbeline,41,2.4.149,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Very true,"
29808,Cymbeline,41,2.4.150,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"And so, I hope, he came by't. Back my ring:"
29809,Cymbeline,41,2.4.151,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Render to me some corporal sign about her,"
29810,Cymbeline,41,2.4.152,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"More evident than this, for this was stolen."
29811,Cymbeline,42,2.4.153,IACHIMO,"By Jupiter, I had it from her arm."
29812,Cymbeline,43,2.4.154,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Hark you, he swears, by Jupiter he swears."
29813,Cymbeline,43,2.4.155,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"'Tis true:--nay, keep the ring--'tis true: I am sure"
29814,Cymbeline,43,2.4.156,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,She would not lose it: her attendants are
29815,Cymbeline,43,2.4.157,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,All sworn and honourable:--they induced to steal it!
29816,Cymbeline,43,2.4.158,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"And by a stranger!--No, he hath enjoyed her:"
29817,Cymbeline,43,2.4.159,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,The cognizance of her incontinency
29818,Cymbeline,43,2.4.160,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,Is this: she hath bought the name of whore
29819,Cymbeline,43,2.4.161,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,thus dearly.
29820,Cymbeline,43,2.4.162,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"There, take thy hire, and all the fiends of hell"
29821,Cymbeline,43,2.4.163,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,Divide themselves between you!
29822,Cymbeline,44,2.4.164,PHILARIO,"Sir, be patient:"
29823,Cymbeline,44,2.4.165,PHILARIO,This is not strong enough to be believed
29824,Cymbeline,44,2.4.166,PHILARIO,Of one persuaded well of--
29825,Cymbeline,45,2.4.167,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Never talk on't,"
29826,Cymbeline,45,2.4.168,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,She hath been colted by him.
29827,Cymbeline,46,2.4.169,IACHIMO,If you seek
29828,Cymbeline,46,2.4.170,IACHIMO,"For further satisfying, under her breast--"
29829,Cymbeline,46,2.4.171,IACHIMO,"Worthy the pressing--lies a mole, right proud"
29830,Cymbeline,46,2.4.172,IACHIMO,"Of that most delicate lodging: by my life,"
29831,Cymbeline,46,2.4.173,IACHIMO,"I kiss'd it, and it gave me present hunger"
29832,Cymbeline,46,2.4.174,IACHIMO,"To feed again, though full. You do remember"
29833,Cymbeline,46,2.4.175,IACHIMO,This stain upon her?
29834,Cymbeline,47,2.4.176,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Ay, and it doth confirm"
29835,Cymbeline,47,2.4.177,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Another stain, as big as hell can hold,"
29836,Cymbeline,47,2.4.178,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,Were there no more but it.
29837,Cymbeline,48,2.4.179,IACHIMO,Will you hear more?
29838,Cymbeline,49,2.4.180,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Spare your arithmetic: never count the turns,"
29839,Cymbeline,49,2.4.181,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Once, and a million!"
29840,Cymbeline,50,2.4.182,IACHIMO,I'll be sworn--
29841,Cymbeline,51,2.4.183,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,No swearing.
29842,Cymbeline,51,2.4.184,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"If you will swear you have not done't, you lie,"
29843,Cymbeline,51,2.4.185,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"And I will kill thee, if thou dost deny"
29844,Cymbeline,51,2.4.186,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,Thou'st made me cuckold.
29845,Cymbeline,52,2.4.187,IACHIMO,I'll deny nothing.
29846,Cymbeline,53,2.4.188,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"O, that I had her here, to tear her limb-meal!"
29847,Cymbeline,53,2.4.189,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"I will go there and do't, i' the court, before"
29848,Cymbeline,53,2.4.190,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,Her father. I'll do something--
29849,Cymbeline,53,,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,Exit
29850,Cymbeline,54,2.4.191,PHILARIO,Quite besides
29851,Cymbeline,54,2.4.192,PHILARIO,The government of patience! You have won:
29852,Cymbeline,54,2.4.193,PHILARIO,"Let's follow him, and pervert the present wrath"
29853,Cymbeline,54,2.4.194,PHILARIO,He hath against himself.
29854,Cymbeline,55,2.4.195,IACHIMO,With an my heart.
29855,Cymbeline,55,,IACHIMO,Exeunt
29856,Cymbeline,55,,IACHIMO,SCENE V. Another room in Philario's house.
29857,Cymbeline,55,,IACHIMO,Enter POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

29866,Cymbeline,1,2.5.9,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,Me of my lawful pleasure she restrain'd

29876,Cymbeline,1,2.5.19,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,Should from encounter guard. Could I find out
29877,Cymbeline,1,2.5.20,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,The woman's part in me! For there's no motion
29878,Cymbeline,1,2.5.21,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"That tends to vice in man, but I affirm"
29879,Cymbeline,1,2.5.22,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"It is the woman's part: be it lying, note it,"

29895,Cymbeline,1,,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,SCENE I. Britain. A hall in Cymbeline's palace.
29896,Cymbeline,1,,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Enter in state, CYMBELINE, QUEEN, CLOTEN,  and Lords at one door, and at another, CAIUS LUCIUS and Attendants"
29897,Cymbeline,1,3.1.1,CYMBELINE,"Now say, what would Augustus Caesar with us?"
29898,Cymbeline,2,3.1.2,CAIUS LUCIUS,"When Julius Caesar, whose remembrance yet"
29899,Cymbeline,2,3.1.3,CAIUS LUCIUS,Lives in men's eyes and will to ears and tongues
29900,Cymbeline,2,3.1.4,CAIUS LUCIUS,"Be theme and hearing ever, was in this Britain"
29901,Cymbeline,2,3.1.5,CAIUS LUCIUS,"And conquer'd it, Cassibelan, thine uncle,--"
29902,Cymbeline,2,3.1.6,CAIUS LUCIUS,"Famous in Caesar's praises, no whit less"
29903,Cymbeline,2,3.1.7,CAIUS LUCIUS,Than in his feats deserving it--for him
29904,Cymbeline,2,3.1.8,CAIUS LUCIUS,"And his succession granted Rome a tribute,"
29905,Cymbeline,2,3.1.9,CAIUS LUCIUS,"Yearly three thousand pounds, which by thee lately"
29906,Cymbeline,2,3.1.10,CAIUS LUCIUS,Is left untender'd.
29907,Cymbeline,3,3.1.11,QUEEN,"And, to kill the marvel,"
29908,Cymbeline,3,3.1.12,QUEEN,Shall be so ever.
29909,Cymbeline,4,3.1.13,CLOTEN,"There be many Caesars,"
29910,Cymbeline,4,3.1.14,CLOTEN,Ere such another Julius. Britain is
29911,Cymbeline,4,3.1.15,CLOTEN,"A world by itself, and we will nothing pay"
29912,Cymbeline,4,3.1.16,CLOTEN,For wearing our own noses.
29913,Cymbeline,5,3.1.17,QUEEN,That opportunity
29914,Cymbeline,5,3.1.18,QUEEN,"Which then they had to take from 's, to resume"
29915,Cymbeline,5,3.1.19,QUEEN,"We have again. Remember, sir, my liege,"
29916,Cymbeline,5,3.1.20,QUEEN,"The kings your ancestors, together with"
29917,Cymbeline,5,3.1.21,QUEEN,"The natural bravery of your isle, which stands"
29918,Cymbeline,5,3.1.22,QUEEN,"As Neptune's park, ribbed and paled in"
29919,Cymbeline,5,3.1.23,QUEEN,"With rocks unscalable and roaring waters,"
29920,Cymbeline,5,3.1.24,QUEEN,"With sands that will not bear your enemies' boats,"
29921,Cymbeline,5,3.1.25,QUEEN,But suck them up to the topmast. A kind of conquest
29922,Cymbeline,5,3.1.26,QUEEN,"Caesar made here, but made not here his brag"
29923,Cymbeline,5,3.1.27,QUEEN,Of 'Came' and 'saw' and 'overcame: ' with shame--
29924,Cymbeline,5,3.1.28,QUEEN,That first that ever touch'd him--he was carried
29925,Cymbeline,5,3.1.29,QUEEN,"From off our coast, twice beaten, and his shipping--"
29926,Cymbeline,5,3.1.30,QUEEN,"Poor ignorant baubles!-- upon our terrible seas,"
29927,Cymbeline,5,3.1.31,QUEEN,"Like egg-shells moved upon their surges, crack'd"
29928,Cymbeline,5,3.1.32,QUEEN,As easily 'gainst our rocks: for joy whereof
29929,Cymbeline,5,3.1.33,QUEEN,"The famed Cassibelan, who was once at point--"
29930,Cymbeline,5,3.1.34,QUEEN,"O giglot fortune!--to master Caesar's sword,"
29931,Cymbeline,5,3.1.35,QUEEN,Made Lud's town with rejoicing fires bright
29932,Cymbeline,5,3.1.36,QUEEN,And Britons strut with courage.
29933,Cymbeline,6,3.1.37,CLOTEN,"Come, there's no more tribute to be paid: our"
29934,Cymbeline,6,3.1.38,CLOTEN,"kingdom is stronger than it was at that time, and,"
29935,Cymbeline,6,3.1.39,CLOTEN,"as I said, there is no moe such Caesars: other of"
29936,Cymbeline,6,3.1.40,CLOTEN,"them may have crook'd noses, but to owe such"
29937,Cymbeline,6,3.1.41,CLOTEN,"straight arms, none."
29938,Cymbeline,7,3.1.42,CYMBELINE,"Son, let your mother end."
29939,Cymbeline,8,3.1.43,CLOTEN,We have yet many among us can gripe as hard as
29940,Cymbeline,8,3.1.44,CLOTEN,"Cassibelan: I do not say I am one, but I have a"
29941,Cymbeline,8,3.1.45,CLOTEN,hand. Why tribute? why should we pay tribute? If
29942,Cymbeline,8,3.1.46,CLOTEN,"Caesar can hide the sun from us with a blanket, or"
29943,Cymbeline,8,3.1.47,CLOTEN,"put the moon in his pocket, we will pay him tribute"
29944,Cymbeline,8,3.1.48,CLOTEN,"for light, else, sir, no more tribute, pray you now."
29945,Cymbeline,9,3.1.49,CYMBELINE,"You must know,"
29946,Cymbeline,9,3.1.50,CYMBELINE,Till the injurious Romans did extort
29947,Cymbeline,9,3.1.51,CYMBELINE,"This tribute from us, we were free:"
29948,Cymbeline,9,3.1.52,CYMBELINE,"Caesar's ambition,"
29949,Cymbeline,9,3.1.53,CYMBELINE,Which swell'd so much that it did almost stretch
29950,Cymbeline,9,3.1.54,CYMBELINE,"The sides o' the world, against all colour here"
29951,Cymbeline,9,3.1.55,CYMBELINE,"Did put the yoke upon 's, which to shake off"
29952,Cymbeline,9,3.1.56,CYMBELINE,"Becomes a warlike people, whom we reckon"
29953,Cymbeline,9,3.1.57,CYMBELINE,Ourselves to be.
29954,Cymbeline,11,3.1.58,Lords,We do.
29955,Cymbeline,12,3.1.59,CYMBELINE,"Say, then, to Caesar,"
29956,Cymbeline,12,3.1.60,CYMBELINE,Our ancestor was that Mulmutius which
29957,Cymbeline,12,3.1.61,CYMBELINE,"Ordain'd our laws, whose use the sword of Caesar"
29958,Cymbeline,12,3.1.62,CYMBELINE,"Hath too much mangled, whose repair and franchise"
29959,Cymbeline,12,3.1.63,CYMBELINE,"Shall, by the power we hold, be our good deed,"
29960,Cymbeline,12,3.1.64,CYMBELINE,"Though Rome be therefore angry: Mulmutius made our laws,"
29961,Cymbeline,12,3.1.65,CYMBELINE,Who was the first of Britain which did put
29962,Cymbeline,12,3.1.66,CYMBELINE,His brows within a golden crown and call'd
29963,Cymbeline,12,3.1.67,CYMBELINE,Himself a king.
29964,Cymbeline,13,3.1.68,CAIUS LUCIUS,"I am sorry, Cymbeline,"
29965,Cymbeline,13,3.1.69,CAIUS LUCIUS,That I am to pronounce Augustus Caesar--

29969,Cymbeline,13,3.1.73,CAIUS LUCIUS,In Caesar's name pronounce I 'gainst thee: look
29970,Cymbeline,13,3.1.74,CAIUS LUCIUS,"For fury not to be resisted. Thus defied,"
29971,Cymbeline,13,3.1.75,CAIUS LUCIUS,I thank thee for myself.
29972,Cymbeline,14,3.1.76,CYMBELINE,"Thou art welcome, Caius."
29973,Cymbeline,14,3.1.77,CYMBELINE,"Thy Caesar knighted me, my youth I spent"
29974,Cymbeline,14,3.1.78,CYMBELINE,"Much under him, of him I gather'd honour,"
29975,Cymbeline,14,3.1.79,CYMBELINE,"Which he to seek of me again, perforce,"
29976,Cymbeline,14,3.1.80,CYMBELINE,Behoves me keep at utterance. I am perfect
29977,Cymbeline,14,3.1.81,CYMBELINE,That the Pannonians and Dalmatians for
29978,Cymbeline,14,3.1.82,CYMBELINE,"Their liberties are now in arms, a precedent"
29979,Cymbeline,14,3.1.83,CYMBELINE,Which not to read would show the Britons cold:
29980,Cymbeline,14,3.1.84,CYMBELINE,So Caesar shall not find them.
29981,Cymbeline,15,3.1.85,CAIUS LUCIUS,Let proof speak.
29982,Cymbeline,16,3.1.86,CLOTEN,His majesty bids you welcome. Make
29983,Cymbeline,16,3.1.87,CLOTEN,"pastime with us a day or two, or longer: if"
29984,Cymbeline,16,3.1.88,CLOTEN,"you seek us afterwards in other terms, you"
29985,Cymbeline,16,3.1.89,CLOTEN,shall find us in our salt-water girdle: if you
29986,Cymbeline,16,3.1.90,CLOTEN,"beat us out of it, it is yours, if you fall in"
29987,Cymbeline,16,3.1.91,CLOTEN,"the adventure, our crows shall fare the better"
29988,Cymbeline,16,3.1.92,CLOTEN,"for you, and there's an end."
29989,Cymbeline,17,3.1.93,CAIUS LUCIUS,"So, sir."
29990,Cymbeline,18,3.1.94,CYMBELINE,I know your master's pleasure and he mine:
29991,Cymbeline,18,3.1.95,CYMBELINE,All the remain is 'Welcome!'

29994,Cymbeline,18,,CYMBELINE,"Enter PISANIO, with a letter"
29995,Cymbeline,1,3.2.1,PISANIO,How? of adultery? Wherefore write you not

29997,Cymbeline,1,3.2.3,PISANIO,O master! what a strange infection

29999,Cymbeline,1,3.2.5,PISANIO,"As poisonous-tongued as handed, hath prevail'd"
30000,Cymbeline,1,3.2.6,PISANIO,On thy too ready hearing? Disloyal! No:
30001,Cymbeline,1,3.2.7,PISANIO,"She's punish'd for her truth, and undergoes,"
30002,Cymbeline,1,3.2.8,PISANIO,"More goddess-like than wife-like, such assaults"
30003,Cymbeline,1,3.2.9,PISANIO,As would take in some virtue. O my master!
30004,Cymbeline,1,3.2.10,PISANIO,Thy mind to her is now as low as were

30010,Cymbeline,1,3.2.16,PISANIO,That I should seem to lack humanity
30011,Cymbeline,1,3.2.17,PISANIO,so much as this fact comes to?

30048,Cymbeline,4,3.2.51,IMOGEN,"He is at Milford-Haven: read, and tell me"
30049,Cymbeline,4,3.2.52,IMOGEN,How far 'tis thither. If one of mean affairs

30080,Cymbeline,6,3.2.82,IMOGEN,A franklin's housewife.
30081,Cymbeline,7,3.2.83,PISANIO,"Madam, you're best consider."
30082,Cymbeline,8,3.2.84,IMOGEN,"I see before me, man: nor here, nor here,"
30083,Cymbeline,8,3.2.85,IMOGEN,"Nor what ensues, but have a fog in them,"
30084,Cymbeline,8,3.2.86,IMOGEN,"That I cannot look through. Away, I prithee,"
30085,Cymbeline,8,3.2.87,IMOGEN,"Do as I bid thee: there's no more to say,"
30086,Cymbeline,8,3.2.88,IMOGEN,Accessible is none but Milford way.
30087,Cymbeline,8,,IMOGEN,Exeunt
30088,Cymbeline,8,,IMOGEN,SCENE III. Wales: a mountainous country with a cave.
30089,Cymbeline,8,,IMOGEN,"Enter, from the cave, BELARIUS, GUIDERIUS, and ARVIRAGUS following"
30090,Cymbeline,1,3.3.1,BELARIUS,"A goodly day not to keep house, with such"
30091,Cymbeline,1,3.3.2,BELARIUS,"Whose roof's as low as ours! Stoop, boys, this gate"
30092,Cymbeline,1,3.3.3,BELARIUS,Instructs you how to adore the heavens and bows you
30093,Cymbeline,1,3.3.4,BELARIUS,To a morning's holy office: the gates of monarchs
30094,Cymbeline,1,3.3.5,BELARIUS,Are arch'd so high that giants may jet through
30095,Cymbeline,1,3.3.6,BELARIUS,"And keep their impious turbans on, without"
30096,Cymbeline,1,3.3.7,BELARIUS,"Good morrow to the sun. Hail, thou fair heaven!"
30097,Cymbeline,1,3.3.8,BELARIUS,"We house i' the rock, yet use thee not so hardly"
30098,Cymbeline,1,3.3.9,BELARIUS,As prouder livers do.
30099,Cymbeline,2,3.3.10,GUIDERIUS,"Hail, heaven!"
30100,Cymbeline,3,3.3.11,ARVIRAGUS,"Hail, heaven!"
30101,Cymbeline,4,3.3.12,BELARIUS,"Now for our mountain sport: up to yond hill,"
30102,Cymbeline,4,3.3.13,BELARIUS,"Your legs are young, I'll tread these flats. Consider,"
30103,Cymbeline,4,3.3.14,BELARIUS,"When you above perceive me like a crow,"
30104,Cymbeline,4,3.3.15,BELARIUS,"That it is place which lessens and sets off,"
30105,Cymbeline,4,3.3.16,BELARIUS,And you may then revolve what tales I have told you
30106,Cymbeline,4,3.3.17,BELARIUS,"Of courts, of princes, of the tricks in war:"
30107,Cymbeline,4,3.3.18,BELARIUS,"This service is not service, so being done,"
30108,Cymbeline,4,3.3.19,BELARIUS,"But being so allow'd: to apprehend thus,"
30109,Cymbeline,4,3.3.20,BELARIUS,"Draws us a profit from all things we see,"
30110,Cymbeline,4,3.3.21,BELARIUS,"And often, to our comfort, shall we find"
30111,Cymbeline,4,3.3.22,BELARIUS,The sharded beetle in a safer hold
30112,Cymbeline,4,3.3.23,BELARIUS,"Than is the full-wing'd eagle. O, this life"
30113,Cymbeline,4,3.3.24,BELARIUS,"Is nobler than attending for a cheque,"
30114,Cymbeline,4,3.3.25,BELARIUS,"Richer than doing nothing for a bauble,"
30115,Cymbeline,4,3.3.26,BELARIUS,Prouder than rustling in unpaid-for silk:
30116,Cymbeline,4,3.3.27,BELARIUS,"Such gain the cap of him that makes 'em fine,"
30117,Cymbeline,4,3.3.28,BELARIUS,Yet keeps his book uncross'd: no life to ours.
30118,Cymbeline,5,3.3.29,GUIDERIUS,"Out of your proof you speak: we, poor unfledged,"
30119,Cymbeline,5,3.3.30,GUIDERIUS,"Have never wing'd from view o' the nest, nor know not"
30120,Cymbeline,5,3.3.31,GUIDERIUS,"What air's from home. Haply this life is best,"
30121,Cymbeline,5,3.3.32,GUIDERIUS,"If quiet life be best, sweeter to you"
30122,Cymbeline,5,3.3.33,GUIDERIUS,"That have a sharper known, well corresponding"
30123,Cymbeline,5,3.3.34,GUIDERIUS,With your stiff age: but unto us it is
30124,Cymbeline,5,3.3.35,GUIDERIUS,"A cell of ignorance, travelling a-bed,"
30125,Cymbeline,5,3.3.36,GUIDERIUS,"A prison for a debtor, that not dares"
30126,Cymbeline,5,3.3.37,GUIDERIUS,To stride a limit.
30127,Cymbeline,6,3.3.38,ARVIRAGUS,What should we speak of
30128,Cymbeline,6,3.3.39,ARVIRAGUS,When we are old as you? when we shall hear
30129,Cymbeline,6,3.3.40,ARVIRAGUS,"The rain and wind beat dark December, how,"
30130,Cymbeline,6,3.3.41,ARVIRAGUS,"In this our pinching cave, shall we discourse"
30131,Cymbeline,6,3.3.42,ARVIRAGUS,"The freezing hours away? We have seen nothing,"
30132,Cymbeline,6,3.3.43,ARVIRAGUS,"We are beastly, subtle as the fox for prey,"
30133,Cymbeline,6,3.3.44,ARVIRAGUS,"Like warlike as the wolf for what we eat,"
30134,Cymbeline,6,3.3.45,ARVIRAGUS,"Our valour is to chase what flies, our cage"
30135,Cymbeline,6,3.3.46,ARVIRAGUS,"We make a quire, as doth the prison'd bird,"
30136,Cymbeline,6,3.3.47,ARVIRAGUS,And sing our bondage freely.
30137,Cymbeline,7,3.3.48,BELARIUS,How you speak!
30138,Cymbeline,7,3.3.49,BELARIUS,Did you but know the city's usuries
30139,Cymbeline,7,3.3.50,BELARIUS,"And felt them knowingly, the art o' the court"
30140,Cymbeline,7,3.3.51,BELARIUS,"As hard to leave as keep, whose top to climb"
30141,Cymbeline,7,3.3.52,BELARIUS,"Is certain falling, or so slippery that"
30142,Cymbeline,7,3.3.53,BELARIUS,"The fear's as bad as falling, the toil o' the war,"
30143,Cymbeline,7,3.3.54,BELARIUS,A pain that only seems to seek out danger
30144,Cymbeline,7,3.3.55,BELARIUS,"I' the name of fame and honour, which dies i'"
30145,Cymbeline,7,3.3.56,BELARIUS,"the search,"
30146,Cymbeline,7,3.3.57,BELARIUS,And hath as oft a slanderous epitaph
30147,Cymbeline,7,3.3.58,BELARIUS,"As record of fair act, nay, many times,"
30148,Cymbeline,7,3.3.59,BELARIUS,"Doth ill deserve by doing well, what's worse,"
30149,Cymbeline,7,3.3.60,BELARIUS,"Must court'sy at the censure:--O boys, this story"
30150,Cymbeline,7,3.3.61,BELARIUS,The world may read in me: my body's mark'd
30151,Cymbeline,7,3.3.62,BELARIUS,"With Roman swords, and my report was once"
30152,Cymbeline,7,3.3.63,BELARIUS,"First with the best of note: Cymbeline loved me,"
30153,Cymbeline,7,3.3.64,BELARIUS,"And when a soldier was the theme, my name"
30154,Cymbeline,7,3.3.65,BELARIUS,Was not far off: then was I as a tree
30155,Cymbeline,7,3.3.66,BELARIUS,"Whose boughs did bend with fruit: but in one night,"
30156,Cymbeline,7,3.3.67,BELARIUS,"A storm or robbery, call it what you will,"
30157,Cymbeline,7,3.3.68,BELARIUS,"Shook down my mellow hangings, nay, my leaves,"
30158,Cymbeline,7,3.3.69,BELARIUS,And left me bare to weather.
30159,Cymbeline,8,3.3.70,GUIDERIUS,Uncertain favour!
30160,Cymbeline,9,3.3.71,BELARIUS,My fault being nothing--as I have told you oft--
30161,Cymbeline,9,3.3.72,BELARIUS,"But that two villains, whose false oaths prevail'd"
30162,Cymbeline,9,3.3.73,BELARIUS,"Before my perfect honour, swore to Cymbeline"
30163,Cymbeline,9,3.3.74,BELARIUS,I was confederate with the Romans: so
30164,Cymbeline,9,3.3.75,BELARIUS,"Follow'd my banishment, and this twenty years"
30165,Cymbeline,9,3.3.76,BELARIUS,"This rock and these demesnes have been my world,"
30166,Cymbeline,9,3.3.77,BELARIUS,"Where I have lived at honest freedom, paid"
30167,Cymbeline,9,3.3.78,BELARIUS,More pious debts to heaven than in all
30168,Cymbeline,9,3.3.79,BELARIUS,The fore-end of my time. But up to the mountains!
30169,Cymbeline,9,3.3.80,BELARIUS,This is not hunters' language: he that strikes
30170,Cymbeline,9,3.3.81,BELARIUS,"The venison first shall be the lord o' the feast,"
30171,Cymbeline,9,3.3.82,BELARIUS,"To him the other two shall minister,"
30172,Cymbeline,9,3.3.83,BELARIUS,"And we will fear no poison, which attends"
30173,Cymbeline,9,3.3.84,BELARIUS,In place of greater state. I'll meet you in the valleys.
30174,Cymbeline,9,,BELARIUS,Exeunt GUIDERIUS and ARVIRAGUS
30175,Cymbeline,9,3.3.85,BELARIUS,How hard it is to hide the sparks of nature!
30176,Cymbeline,9,3.3.86,BELARIUS,"These boys know little they are sons to the king,"
30177,Cymbeline,9,3.3.87,BELARIUS,Nor Cymbeline dreams that they are alive.
30178,Cymbeline,9,3.3.88,BELARIUS,"They think they are mine, and though train'd"
30179,Cymbeline,9,3.3.89,BELARIUS,up thus meanly
30180,Cymbeline,9,3.3.90,BELARIUS,"I' the cave wherein they bow, their thoughts do hit"
30181,Cymbeline,9,3.3.91,BELARIUS,"The roofs of palaces, and nature prompts them"
30182,Cymbeline,9,3.3.92,BELARIUS,In simple and low things to prince it much
30183,Cymbeline,9,3.3.93,BELARIUS,"Beyond the trick of others. This Polydore,"
30184,Cymbeline,9,3.3.94,BELARIUS,"The heir of Cymbeline and Britain, who"
30185,Cymbeline,9,3.3.95,BELARIUS,"The king his father call'd Guiderius,--Jove!"
30186,Cymbeline,9,3.3.96,BELARIUS,When on my three-foot stool I sit and tell
30187,Cymbeline,9,3.3.97,BELARIUS,"The warlike feats I have done, his spirits fly out"
30188,Cymbeline,9,3.3.98,BELARIUS,"Into my story: say 'Thus, mine enemy fell,"
30189,Cymbeline,9,3.3.99,BELARIUS,"And thus I set my foot on 's neck,' even then"
30190,Cymbeline,9,3.3.100,BELARIUS,"The princely blood flows in his cheek, he sweats,"
30191,Cymbeline,9,3.3.101,BELARIUS,Strains his young nerves and puts himself in posture
30192,Cymbeline,9,3.3.102,BELARIUS,"That acts my words. The younger brother, Cadwal,"
30193,Cymbeline,9,3.3.103,BELARIUS,"Once Arviragus, in as like a figure,"
30194,Cymbeline,9,3.3.104,BELARIUS,Strikes life into my speech and shows much more
30195,Cymbeline,9,3.3.105,BELARIUS,"His own conceiving.--Hark, the game is roused!"
30196,Cymbeline,9,3.3.106,BELARIUS,O Cymbeline! heaven and my conscience knows
30197,Cymbeline,9,3.3.107,BELARIUS,"Thou didst unjustly banish me: whereon,"
30198,Cymbeline,9,3.3.108,BELARIUS,"At three and two years old, I stole these babes,"
30199,Cymbeline,9,3.3.109,BELARIUS,"Thinking to bar thee of succession, as"
30200,Cymbeline,9,3.3.110,BELARIUS,"Thou reft'st me of my lands. Euriphile,"
30201,Cymbeline,9,3.3.111,BELARIUS,"Thou wast their nurse, they took thee for"
30202,Cymbeline,9,3.3.112,BELARIUS,"their mother,"
30203,Cymbeline,9,3.3.113,BELARIUS,And every day do honour to her grave:
30204,Cymbeline,9,3.3.114,BELARIUS,"Myself, Belarius, that am Morgan call'd,"
30205,Cymbeline,9,3.3.115,BELARIUS,They take for natural father. The game is up.
30206,Cymbeline,9,,BELARIUS,Exit
30207,Cymbeline,9,,BELARIUS,SCENE IV. Country near Milford-Haven.
30208,Cymbeline,9,,BELARIUS,Enter PISANIO and IMOGEN
30209,Cymbeline,1,3.4.1,IMOGEN,"Thou told'st me, when we came from horse, the place"
30210,Cymbeline,1,3.4.2,IMOGEN,Was near at hand: ne'er long'd my mother so
30211,Cymbeline,1,3.4.3,IMOGEN,"To see me first, as I have now. Pisanio! man!"
30212,Cymbeline,1,3.4.4,IMOGEN,"Where is Posthumus? What is in thy mind,"
30213,Cymbeline,1,3.4.5,IMOGEN,That makes thee stare thus? Wherefore breaks that sigh
30214,Cymbeline,1,3.4.6,IMOGEN,"From the inward of thee? One, but painted thus,"
30215,Cymbeline,1,3.4.7,IMOGEN,Would be interpreted a thing perplex'd
30216,Cymbeline,1,3.4.8,IMOGEN,Beyond self-explication: put thyself
30217,Cymbeline,1,3.4.9,IMOGEN,"Into a havior of less fear, ere wildness"
30218,Cymbeline,1,3.4.10,IMOGEN,Vanquish my staider senses. What's the matter?
30219,Cymbeline,1,3.4.11,IMOGEN,"Why tender'st thou that paper to me, with"
30220,Cymbeline,1,3.4.12,IMOGEN,"A look untender? If't be summer news,"
30221,Cymbeline,1,3.4.13,IMOGEN,"Smile to't before, if winterly, thou need'st"
30222,Cymbeline,1,3.4.14,IMOGEN,But keep that countenance still. My husband's hand!
30223,Cymbeline,1,3.4.15,IMOGEN,"That drug-damn'd Italy hath out-craftied him,"
30224,Cymbeline,1,3.4.16,IMOGEN,"And he's at some hard point. Speak, man: thy tongue"
30225,Cymbeline,1,3.4.17,IMOGEN,"May take off some extremity, which to read"
30226,Cymbeline,1,3.4.18,IMOGEN,Would be even mortal to me.
30227,Cymbeline,2,3.4.19,PISANIO,"Please you, read,"
30228,Cymbeline,2,3.4.20,PISANIO,"And you shall find me, wretched man, a thing"
30229,Cymbeline,2,3.4.21,PISANIO,The most disdain'd of fortune.
30230,Cymbeline,3,3.4.22,IMOGEN,"[Reads]  'Thy mistress, Pisanio, hath played the"
30231,Cymbeline,3,3.4.23,IMOGEN,"strumpet in my bed, the testimonies whereof lie"
30232,Cymbeline,3,3.4.24,IMOGEN,"bleeding in me. I speak not out of weak surmises,"
30233,Cymbeline,3,3.4.25,IMOGEN,but from proof as strong as my grief and as certain
30234,Cymbeline,3,3.4.26,IMOGEN,"as I expect my revenge. That part thou, Pisanio,"
30235,Cymbeline,3,3.4.27,IMOGEN,"must act for me, if thy faith be not tainted with"
30236,Cymbeline,3,3.4.28,IMOGEN,the breach of hers. Let thine own hands take away
30237,Cymbeline,3,3.4.29,IMOGEN,her life: I shall give thee opportunity at
30238,Cymbeline,3,3.4.30,IMOGEN,Milford-Haven. She hath my letter for the purpose
30239,Cymbeline,3,3.4.31,IMOGEN,"where, if thou fear to strike and to make me certain"
30240,Cymbeline,3,3.4.32,IMOGEN,"it is done, thou art the pandar to her dishonour and"
30241,Cymbeline,3,3.4.33,IMOGEN,equally to me disloyal.'
30242,Cymbeline,4,3.4.34,PISANIO,What shall I need to draw my sword? the paper
30243,Cymbeline,4,3.4.35,PISANIO,"Hath cut her throat already. No, 'tis slander,"
30244,Cymbeline,4,3.4.36,PISANIO,"Whose edge is sharper than the sword, whose tongue"
30245,Cymbeline,4,3.4.37,PISANIO,"Outvenoms all the worms of Nile, whose breath"
30246,Cymbeline,4,3.4.38,PISANIO,Rides on the posting winds and doth belie
30247,Cymbeline,4,3.4.39,PISANIO,"All corners of the world: kings, queens and states,"
30248,Cymbeline,4,3.4.40,PISANIO,"Maids, matrons, nay, the secrets of the grave"
30249,Cymbeline,4,3.4.41,PISANIO,"This viperous slander enters. What cheer, madam?"
30250,Cymbeline,5,3.4.42,IMOGEN,False to his bed! What is it to be false?
30251,Cymbeline,5,3.4.43,IMOGEN,To lie in watch there and to think on him?
30252,Cymbeline,5,3.4.44,IMOGEN,To weep 'twixt clock and clock? if sleep
30253,Cymbeline,5,3.4.45,IMOGEN,"charge nature,"
30254,Cymbeline,5,3.4.46,IMOGEN,To break it with a fearful dream of him
30255,Cymbeline,5,3.4.47,IMOGEN,"And cry myself awake? that's false to's bed, is it?"
30256,Cymbeline,6,3.4.48,PISANIO,"Alas, good lady!"
30257,Cymbeline,7,3.4.49,IMOGEN,"I false! Thy conscience witness: Iachimo,"
30258,Cymbeline,7,3.4.50,IMOGEN,"Thou didst accuse him of incontinency,"
30259,Cymbeline,7,3.4.51,IMOGEN,"Thou then look'dst like a villain, now methinks"
30260,Cymbeline,7,3.4.52,IMOGEN,Thy favour's good enough. Some jay of Italy
30261,Cymbeline,7,3.4.53,IMOGEN,"Whose mother was her painting, hath betray'd him:"
30262,Cymbeline,7,3.4.54,IMOGEN,"Poor I am stale, a garment out of fashion,"
30263,Cymbeline,7,3.4.55,IMOGEN,"And, for I am richer than to hang by the walls,"
30264,Cymbeline,7,3.4.56,IMOGEN,"I must be ripp'd:--to pieces with me!--O,"
30265,Cymbeline,7,3.4.57,IMOGEN,"Men's vows are women's traitors! All good seeming,"
30266,Cymbeline,7,3.4.58,IMOGEN,"By thy revolt, O husband, shall be thought"
30267,Cymbeline,7,3.4.59,IMOGEN,"Put on for villany, not born where't grows,"
30268,Cymbeline,7,3.4.60,IMOGEN,But worn a bait for ladies.
30269,Cymbeline,8,3.4.61,PISANIO,"Good madam, hear me."
30270,Cymbeline,9,3.4.62,IMOGEN,"True honest men being heard, like false Aeneas,"
30271,Cymbeline,9,3.4.63,IMOGEN,"Were in his time thought false, and Sinon's weeping"
30272,Cymbeline,9,3.4.64,IMOGEN,"Did scandal many a holy tear, took pity"
30273,Cymbeline,9,3.4.65,IMOGEN,"From most true wretchedness: so thou, Posthumus,"
30274,Cymbeline,9,3.4.66,IMOGEN,"Wilt lay the leaven on all proper men,"
30275,Cymbeline,9,3.4.67,IMOGEN,Goodly and gallant shall be false and perjured
30276,Cymbeline,9,3.4.68,IMOGEN,"From thy great fall. Come, fellow, be thou honest:"
30277,Cymbeline,9,3.4.69,IMOGEN,"Do thou thy master's bidding: when thou see'st him,"
30278,Cymbeline,9,3.4.70,IMOGEN,A little witness my obedience: look!
30279,Cymbeline,9,3.4.71,IMOGEN,"I draw the sword myself: take it, and hit"
30280,Cymbeline,9,3.4.72,IMOGEN,"The innocent mansion of my love, my heart,"
30281,Cymbeline,9,3.4.73,IMOGEN,"Fear not, 'tis empty of all things but grief,"
30282,Cymbeline,9,3.4.74,IMOGEN,"Thy master is not there, who was indeed"
30283,Cymbeline,9,3.4.75,IMOGEN,"The riches of it: do his bidding, strike"
30284,Cymbeline,9,3.4.76,IMOGEN,"Thou mayst be valiant in a better cause,"
30285,Cymbeline,9,3.4.77,IMOGEN,But now thou seem'st a coward.
30286,Cymbeline,10,3.4.78,PISANIO,"Hence, vile instrument!"
30287,Cymbeline,10,3.4.79,PISANIO,Thou shalt not damn my hand.
30288,Cymbeline,11,3.4.80,IMOGEN,"Why, I must die,"
30289,Cymbeline,11,3.4.81,IMOGEN,"And if I do not by thy hand, thou art"
30290,Cymbeline,11,3.4.82,IMOGEN,No servant of thy master's. Against self-slaughter
30291,Cymbeline,11,3.4.83,IMOGEN,There is a prohibition so divine
30292,Cymbeline,11,3.4.84,IMOGEN,"That cravens my weak hand. Come, here's my heart."
30293,Cymbeline,11,3.4.85,IMOGEN,"Something's afore't. Soft, soft! we'll no defence,"
30294,Cymbeline,11,3.4.86,IMOGEN,Obedient as the scabbard. What is here?
30295,Cymbeline,11,3.4.87,IMOGEN,"The scriptures of the loyal Leonatus,"
30296,Cymbeline,11,3.4.88,IMOGEN,"All turn'd to heresy? Away, away,"
30297,Cymbeline,11,3.4.89,IMOGEN,Corrupters of my faith! you shall no more
30298,Cymbeline,11,3.4.90,IMOGEN,Be stomachers to my heart. Thus may poor fools
30299,Cymbeline,11,3.4.91,IMOGEN,Believe false teachers: though those that
30300,Cymbeline,11,3.4.92,IMOGEN,are betray'd
30301,Cymbeline,11,3.4.93,IMOGEN,"Do feel the treason sharply, yet the traitor"
30302,Cymbeline,11,3.4.94,IMOGEN,Stands in worse case of woe.
30303,Cymbeline,11,3.4.95,IMOGEN,"And thou, Posthumus, thou that didst set up"
30304,Cymbeline,11,3.4.96,IMOGEN,My disobedience 'gainst the king my father
30305,Cymbeline,11,3.4.97,IMOGEN,And make me put into contempt the suits
30306,Cymbeline,11,3.4.98,IMOGEN,"Of princely fellows, shalt hereafter find"
30307,Cymbeline,11,3.4.99,IMOGEN,"It is no act of common passage, but"
30308,Cymbeline,11,3.4.100,IMOGEN,A strain of rareness: and I grieve myself
30309,Cymbeline,11,3.4.101,IMOGEN,"To think, when thou shalt be disedged by her"
30310,Cymbeline,11,3.4.102,IMOGEN,"That now thou tirest on, how thy memory"
30311,Cymbeline,11,3.4.103,IMOGEN,"Will then be pang'd by me. Prithee, dispatch:"
30312,Cymbeline,11,3.4.104,IMOGEN,The lamb entreats the butcher: where's thy knife?
30313,Cymbeline,11,3.4.105,IMOGEN,"Thou art too slow to do thy master's bidding,"
30314,Cymbeline,11,3.4.106,IMOGEN,When I desire it too.
30315,Cymbeline,12,3.4.107,PISANIO,"O gracious lady,"
30316,Cymbeline,12,3.4.108,PISANIO,Since I received command to do this business
30317,Cymbeline,12,3.4.109,PISANIO,I have not slept one wink.
30318,Cymbeline,13,3.4.110,IMOGEN,"Do't, and to bed then."
30319,Cymbeline,14,3.4.111,PISANIO,I'll wake mine eye-balls blind first.
30320,Cymbeline,15,3.4.112,IMOGEN,Wherefore then
30321,Cymbeline,15,3.4.113,IMOGEN,Didst undertake it? Why hast thou abused
30322,Cymbeline,15,3.4.114,IMOGEN,So many miles with a pretence? this place?
30323,Cymbeline,15,3.4.115,IMOGEN,Mine action and thine own? our horses' labour?
30324,Cymbeline,15,3.4.116,IMOGEN,"The time inviting thee? the perturb'd court,"
30325,Cymbeline,15,3.4.117,IMOGEN,For my being absent? whereunto I never
30326,Cymbeline,15,3.4.118,IMOGEN,"Purpose return. Why hast thou gone so far,"
30327,Cymbeline,15,3.4.119,IMOGEN,"To be unbent when thou hast ta'en thy stand,"
30328,Cymbeline,15,3.4.120,IMOGEN,The elected deer before thee?
30329,Cymbeline,16,3.4.121,PISANIO,But to win time
30330,Cymbeline,16,3.4.122,PISANIO,"To lose so bad employment, in the which"
30331,Cymbeline,16,3.4.123,PISANIO,"I have consider'd of a course. Good lady,"
30332,Cymbeline,16,3.4.124,PISANIO,Hear me with patience.
30333,Cymbeline,17,3.4.125,IMOGEN,"Talk thy tongue weary, speak"
30334,Cymbeline,17,3.4.126,IMOGEN,"I have heard I am a strumpet, and mine ear"
30335,Cymbeline,17,3.4.127,IMOGEN,"Therein false struck, can take no greater wound,"
30336,Cymbeline,17,3.4.128,IMOGEN,Nor tent to bottom that. But speak.
30337,Cymbeline,18,3.4.129,PISANIO,"Then, madam,"
30338,Cymbeline,18,3.4.130,PISANIO,I thought you would not back again.
30339,Cymbeline,19,3.4.131,IMOGEN,"Most like,"
30340,Cymbeline,19,3.4.132,IMOGEN,Bringing me here to kill me.
30341,Cymbeline,20,3.4.133,PISANIO,"Not so, neither:"
30342,Cymbeline,20,3.4.134,PISANIO,"But if I were as wise as honest, then"
30343,Cymbeline,20,3.4.135,PISANIO,My purpose would prove well. It cannot be
30344,Cymbeline,20,3.4.136,PISANIO,But that my master is abused:
30345,Cymbeline,20,3.4.137,PISANIO,"Some villain, ay, and singular in his art."
30346,Cymbeline,20,3.4.138,PISANIO,Hath done you both this cursed injury.
30347,Cymbeline,21,3.4.139,IMOGEN,Some Roman courtezan.
30348,Cymbeline,22,3.4.140,PISANIO,"No, on my life."
30349,Cymbeline,22,3.4.141,PISANIO,I'll give but notice you are dead and send him
30350,Cymbeline,22,3.4.142,PISANIO,"Some bloody sign of it, for 'tis commanded"
30351,Cymbeline,22,3.4.143,PISANIO,"I should do so: you shall be miss'd at court,"
30352,Cymbeline,22,3.4.144,PISANIO,And that will well confirm it.
30353,Cymbeline,23,3.4.145,IMOGEN,"Why good fellow,"
30354,Cymbeline,23,3.4.146,IMOGEN,What shall I do the where? where bide? how live?
30355,Cymbeline,23,3.4.147,IMOGEN,"Or in my life what comfort, when I am"
30356,Cymbeline,23,3.4.148,IMOGEN,Dead to my husband?
30357,Cymbeline,24,3.4.149,PISANIO,If you'll back to the court--
30358,Cymbeline,25,3.4.150,IMOGEN,"No court, no father, nor no more ado"
30359,Cymbeline,25,3.4.151,IMOGEN,"With that harsh, noble, simple nothing,"
30360,Cymbeline,25,3.4.152,IMOGEN,"That Cloten, whose love-suit hath been to me"
30361,Cymbeline,25,3.4.153,IMOGEN,As fearful as a siege.
30362,Cymbeline,26,3.4.154,PISANIO,"If not at court,"
30363,Cymbeline,26,3.4.155,PISANIO,Then not in Britain must you bide.
30364,Cymbeline,27,3.4.156,IMOGEN,Where then
30365,Cymbeline,27,3.4.157,IMOGEN,"Hath Britain all the sun that shines? Day, night,"
30366,Cymbeline,27,3.4.158,IMOGEN,Are they not but in Britain? I' the world's volume
30367,Cymbeline,27,3.4.159,IMOGEN,"Our Britain seems as of it, but not in 't,"
30368,Cymbeline,27,3.4.160,IMOGEN,"In a great pool a swan's nest: prithee, think"
30369,Cymbeline,27,3.4.161,IMOGEN,There's livers out of Britain.
30370,Cymbeline,28,3.4.162,PISANIO,I am most glad
30371,Cymbeline,28,3.4.163,PISANIO,"You think of other place. The ambassador,"
30372,Cymbeline,28,3.4.164,PISANIO,"Lucius the Roman, comes to Milford-Haven"
30373,Cymbeline,28,3.4.165,PISANIO,"To-morrow: now, if you could wear a mind"
30374,Cymbeline,28,3.4.166,PISANIO,"Dark as your fortune is, and but disguise"
30375,Cymbeline,28,3.4.167,PISANIO,"That which, to appear itself, must not yet be"
30376,Cymbeline,28,3.4.168,PISANIO,"But by self-danger, you should tread a course"
30377,Cymbeline,28,3.4.169,PISANIO,"Pretty and full of view, yea, haply, near"
30378,Cymbeline,28,3.4.170,PISANIO,"The residence of Posthumus, so nigh at least"
30379,Cymbeline,28,3.4.171,PISANIO,"That though his actions were not visible, yet"
30380,Cymbeline,28,3.4.172,PISANIO,Report should render him hourly to your ear
30381,Cymbeline,28,3.4.173,PISANIO,As truly as he moves.
30382,Cymbeline,29,3.4.174,IMOGEN,"O, for such means!"
30383,Cymbeline,29,3.4.175,IMOGEN,"Though peril to my modesty, not death on't,"
30384,Cymbeline,29,3.4.176,IMOGEN,I would adventure.
30385,Cymbeline,30,3.4.177,PISANIO,"Well, then, here's the point:"
30386,Cymbeline,30,3.4.178,PISANIO,"You must forget to be a woman, change"
30387,Cymbeline,30,3.4.179,PISANIO,Command into obedience: fear and niceness--
30388,Cymbeline,30,3.4.180,PISANIO,"The handmaids of all women, or, more truly,"
30389,Cymbeline,30,3.4.181,PISANIO,Woman its pretty self--into a waggish courage:
30390,Cymbeline,30,3.4.182,PISANIO,"Ready in gibes, quick-answer'd, saucy and"
30391,Cymbeline,30,3.4.183,PISANIO,"As quarrelous as the weasel, nay, you must"
30392,Cymbeline,30,3.4.184,PISANIO,"Forget that rarest treasure of your cheek,"
30393,Cymbeline,30,3.4.185,PISANIO,"Exposing it--but, O, the harder heart!"
30394,Cymbeline,30,3.4.186,PISANIO,"Alack, no remedy!--to the greedy touch"
30395,Cymbeline,30,3.4.187,PISANIO,"Of common-kissing Titan, and forget"
30396,Cymbeline,30,3.4.188,PISANIO,"Your laboursome and dainty trims, wherein"
30397,Cymbeline,30,3.4.189,PISANIO,You made great Juno angry.
30398,Cymbeline,31,3.4.190,IMOGEN,"Nay, be brief"
30399,Cymbeline,31,3.4.191,IMOGEN,"I see into thy end, and am almost"
30400,Cymbeline,31,3.4.192,IMOGEN,A man already.
30401,Cymbeline,32,3.4.193,PISANIO,"First, make yourself but like one."
30402,Cymbeline,32,3.4.194,PISANIO,"Fore-thinking this, I have already fit--"
30403,Cymbeline,32,3.4.195,PISANIO,"'Tis in my cloak-bag--doublet, hat, hose, all"
30404,Cymbeline,32,3.4.196,PISANIO,"That answer to them: would you in their serving,"
30405,Cymbeline,32,3.4.197,PISANIO,And with what imitation you can borrow
30406,Cymbeline,32,3.4.198,PISANIO,"From youth of such a season, 'fore noble Lucius"
30407,Cymbeline,32,3.4.199,PISANIO,"Present yourself, desire his service, tell him"
30408,Cymbeline,32,3.4.200,PISANIO,"wherein you're happy,--which you'll make him know,"
30409,Cymbeline,32,3.4.201,PISANIO,"If that his head have ear in music,--doubtless"
30410,Cymbeline,32,3.4.202,PISANIO,"With joy he will embrace you, for he's honourable"
30411,Cymbeline,32,3.4.203,PISANIO,"And doubling that, most holy. Your means abroad,"
30412,Cymbeline,32,3.4.204,PISANIO,"You have me, rich, and I will never fail"
30413,Cymbeline,32,3.4.205,PISANIO,Beginning nor supplyment.
30414,Cymbeline,33,3.4.206,IMOGEN,Thou art all the comfort
30415,Cymbeline,33,3.4.207,IMOGEN,"The gods will diet me with. Prithee, away:"
30416,Cymbeline,33,3.4.208,IMOGEN,"There's more to be consider'd, but we'll even"
30417,Cymbeline,33,3.4.209,IMOGEN,All that good time will give us: this attempt
30418,Cymbeline,33,3.4.210,IMOGEN,"I am soldier to, and will abide it with"
30419,Cymbeline,33,3.4.211,IMOGEN,"A prince's courage. Away, I prithee."
30420,Cymbeline,34,3.4.212,PISANIO,"Well, madam, we must take a short farewell,"
30421,Cymbeline,34,3.4.213,PISANIO,"Lest, being miss'd, I be suspected of"
30422,Cymbeline,34,3.4.214,PISANIO,"Your carriage from the court. My noble mistress,"
30423,Cymbeline,34,3.4.215,PISANIO,"Here is a box, I had it from the queen:"
30424,Cymbeline,34,3.4.216,PISANIO,"What's in't is precious, if you are sick at sea,"
30425,Cymbeline,34,3.4.217,PISANIO,"Or stomach-qualm'd at land, a dram of this"
30426,Cymbeline,34,3.4.218,PISANIO,"Will drive away distemper. To some shade,"
30427,Cymbeline,34,3.4.219,PISANIO,And fit you to your manhood. May the gods
30428,Cymbeline,34,3.4.220,PISANIO,Direct you to the best!
30429,Cymbeline,35,3.4.221,IMOGEN,Amen: I thank thee.
30430,Cymbeline,35,,IMOGEN,"Exeunt, severally"
30431,Cymbeline,35,,IMOGEN,SCENE V. A room in Cymbeline's palace.
30432,Cymbeline,35,,IMOGEN,"Enter CYMBELINE, QUEEN, CLOTEN, LUCIUS, Lords, and Attendants"
30433,Cymbeline,1,3.5.1,CYMBELINE,"Thus far, and so farewell."
30434,Cymbeline,2,3.5.2,CAIUS LUCIUS,"Thanks, royal sir."
30435,Cymbeline,2,3.5.3,CAIUS LUCIUS,"My emperor hath wrote, I must from hence,"
30436,Cymbeline,2,3.5.4,CAIUS LUCIUS,And am right sorry that I must report ye
30437,Cymbeline,2,3.5.5,CAIUS LUCIUS,My master's enemy.
30438,Cymbeline,3,3.5.6,CYMBELINE,"Our subjects, sir,"
30439,Cymbeline,3,3.5.7,CYMBELINE,"Will not endure his yoke, and for ourself"
30440,Cymbeline,3,3.5.8,CYMBELINE,"To show less sovereignty than they, must needs"
30441,Cymbeline,3,3.5.9,CYMBELINE,Appear unkinglike.
30442,Cymbeline,4,3.5.10,CAIUS LUCIUS,"So, sir: I desire of you"
30443,Cymbeline,4,3.5.11,CAIUS LUCIUS,A conduct over-land to Milford-Haven.
30444,Cymbeline,4,3.5.12,CAIUS LUCIUS,"Madam, all joy befal your grace!"
30445,Cymbeline,5,3.5.13,QUEEN,And you!
30446,Cymbeline,6,3.5.14,CYMBELINE,"My lords, you are appointed for that office,"
30447,Cymbeline,6,3.5.15,CYMBELINE,The due of honour in no point omit.
30448,Cymbeline,6,3.5.16,CYMBELINE,"So farewell, noble Lucius."
30449,Cymbeline,7,3.5.17,CAIUS LUCIUS,"Your hand, my lord."
30450,Cymbeline,8,3.5.18,CLOTEN,"Receive it friendly, but from this time forth"
30451,Cymbeline,8,3.5.19,CLOTEN,I wear it as your enemy.
30452,Cymbeline,9,3.5.20,CAIUS LUCIUS,"Sir, the event"
30453,Cymbeline,9,3.5.21,CAIUS LUCIUS,Is yet to name the winner: fare you well.
30454,Cymbeline,10,3.5.22,CYMBELINE,"Leave not the worthy Lucius, good my lords,"
30455,Cymbeline,10,3.5.23,CYMBELINE,Till he have cross'd the Severn. Happiness!
30456,Cymbeline,10,,CYMBELINE,Exeunt LUCIUS and Lords
30457,Cymbeline,11,3.5.24,QUEEN,He goes hence frowning: but it honours us
30458,Cymbeline,11,3.5.25,QUEEN,That we have given him cause.
30459,Cymbeline,12,3.5.26,CLOTEN,"'Tis all the better,"
30460,Cymbeline,12,3.5.27,CLOTEN,Your valiant Britons have their wishes in it.
30461,Cymbeline,13,3.5.28,CYMBELINE,Lucius hath wrote already to the emperor
30462,Cymbeline,13,3.5.29,CYMBELINE,How it goes here. It fits us therefore ripely
30463,Cymbeline,13,3.5.30,CYMBELINE,Our chariots and our horsemen be in readiness:
30464,Cymbeline,13,3.5.31,CYMBELINE,The powers that he already hath in Gallia
30465,Cymbeline,13,3.5.32,CYMBELINE,"Will soon be drawn to head, from whence he moves"
30466,Cymbeline,13,3.5.33,CYMBELINE,His war for Britain.
30467,Cymbeline,14,3.5.34,QUEEN,"'Tis not sleepy business,"
30468,Cymbeline,14,3.5.35,QUEEN,But must be look'd to speedily and strongly.
30469,Cymbeline,15,3.5.36,CYMBELINE,Our expectation that it would be thus
30470,Cymbeline,15,3.5.37,CYMBELINE,"Hath made us forward. But, my gentle queen,"
30471,Cymbeline,15,3.5.38,CYMBELINE,Where is our daughter? She hath not appear'd
30472,Cymbeline,15,3.5.39,CYMBELINE,"Before the Roman, nor to us hath tender'd"
30473,Cymbeline,15,3.5.40,CYMBELINE,The duty of the day: she looks us like
30474,Cymbeline,15,3.5.41,CYMBELINE,A thing more made of malice than of duty:
30475,Cymbeline,15,3.5.42,CYMBELINE,"We have noted it. Call her before us, for"
30476,Cymbeline,15,3.5.43,CYMBELINE,We have been too slight in sufferance.
30477,Cymbeline,15,,CYMBELINE,Exit an Attendant
30478,Cymbeline,16,3.5.44,QUEEN,"Royal sir,"
30479,Cymbeline,16,3.5.45,QUEEN,"Since the exile of Posthumus, most retired"
30480,Cymbeline,16,3.5.46,QUEEN,"Hath her life been, the cure whereof, my lord,"
30481,Cymbeline,16,3.5.47,QUEEN,"'Tis time must do. Beseech your majesty,"
30482,Cymbeline,16,3.5.48,QUEEN,Forbear sharp speeches to her: she's a lady
30483,Cymbeline,16,3.5.49,QUEEN,So tender of rebukes that words are strokes
30484,Cymbeline,16,3.5.50,QUEEN,And strokes death to her.
30485,Cymbeline,16,,QUEEN,Re-enter Attendant
30486,Cymbeline,17,3.5.51,CYMBELINE,"Where is she, sir? How"
30487,Cymbeline,17,3.5.52,CYMBELINE,Can her contempt be answer'd?
30488,Cymbeline,18,3.5.53,Attendant,"Please you, sir,"
30489,Cymbeline,18,3.5.54,Attendant,"Her chambers are all lock'd, and there's no answer"
30490,Cymbeline,18,3.5.55,Attendant,That will be given to the loudest noise we make.
30491,Cymbeline,19,3.5.56,QUEEN,"My lord, when last I went to visit her,"
30492,Cymbeline,19,3.5.57,QUEEN,"She pray'd me to excuse her keeping close,"
30493,Cymbeline,19,3.5.58,QUEEN,"Whereto constrain'd by her infirmity,"
30494,Cymbeline,19,3.5.59,QUEEN,"She should that duty leave unpaid to you,"
30495,Cymbeline,19,3.5.60,QUEEN,Which daily she was bound to proffer: this
30496,Cymbeline,19,3.5.61,QUEEN,"She wish'd me to make known, but our great court"
30497,Cymbeline,19,3.5.62,QUEEN,Made me to blame in memory.
30498,Cymbeline,20,3.5.63,CYMBELINE,Her doors lock'd?
30499,Cymbeline,20,3.5.64,CYMBELINE,"Not seen of late? Grant, heavens, that which I fear"
30500,Cymbeline,20,3.5.65,CYMBELINE,Prove false!
30501,Cymbeline,20,,CYMBELINE,Exit
30502,Cymbeline,21,3.5.66,QUEEN,"Son, I say, follow the king."
30503,Cymbeline,22,3.5.67,CLOTEN,"That man of hers, Pisanio, her old servant,"
30504,Cymbeline,22,3.5.68,CLOTEN,have not seen these two days.
30505,Cymbeline,23,3.5.69,QUEEN,"Go, look after."
30506,Cymbeline,23,,QUEEN,Exit CLOTEN
30507,Cymbeline,23,3.5.70,QUEEN,"Pisanio, thou that stand'st so for Posthumus!"
30508,Cymbeline,23,3.5.71,QUEEN,"He hath a drug of mine, I pray his absence"
30509,Cymbeline,23,3.5.72,QUEEN,"Proceed by swallowing that, for he believes"
30510,Cymbeline,23,3.5.73,QUEEN,"It is a thing most precious. But for her,"
30511,Cymbeline,23,3.5.74,QUEEN,"Where is she gone? Haply, despair hath seized her,"
30512,Cymbeline,23,3.5.75,QUEEN,"Or, wing'd with fervor of her love, she's flown"
30513,Cymbeline,23,3.5.76,QUEEN,To her desired Posthumus: gone she is
30514,Cymbeline,23,3.5.77,QUEEN,"To death or to dishonour, and my end"
30515,Cymbeline,23,3.5.78,QUEEN,"Can make good use of either: she being down,"
30516,Cymbeline,23,3.5.79,QUEEN,I have the placing of the British crown.
30517,Cymbeline,23,,QUEEN,Re-enter CLOTEN
30518,Cymbeline,23,3.5.80,QUEEN,"How now, my son!"
30519,Cymbeline,24,3.5.81,CLOTEN,'Tis certain she is fled.
30520,Cymbeline,24,3.5.82,CLOTEN,"Go in and cheer the king: he rages, none"
30521,Cymbeline,24,3.5.83,CLOTEN,Dare come about him.
30522,Cymbeline,25,3.5.84,QUEEN,[Aside]            All the better: may

30524,Cymbeline,25,,QUEEN,Exit
30525,Cymbeline,26,3.5.86,CLOTEN,"I love and hate her: for she's fair and royal,"
30526,Cymbeline,26,3.5.87,CLOTEN,And that she hath all courtly parts more exquisite
30527,Cymbeline,26,3.5.88,CLOTEN,"Than lady, ladies, woman, from every one"
30528,Cymbeline,26,3.5.89,CLOTEN,"The best she hath, and she, of all compounded,"
30529,Cymbeline,26,3.5.90,CLOTEN,"Outsells them all, I love her therefore: but"
30530,Cymbeline,26,3.5.91,CLOTEN,Disdaining me and throwing favours on
30531,Cymbeline,26,3.5.92,CLOTEN,The low Posthumus slanders so her judgment
30532,Cymbeline,26,3.5.93,CLOTEN,"That what's else rare is choked, and in that point"
30533,Cymbeline,26,3.5.94,CLOTEN,"I will conclude to hate her, nay, indeed,"
30534,Cymbeline,26,3.5.95,CLOTEN,To be revenged upon her. For when fools Shall--
30535,Cymbeline,26,,CLOTEN,Enter PISANIO
30536,Cymbeline,26,3.5.96,CLOTEN,"Who is here? What, are you packing, sirrah?"
30537,Cymbeline,26,3.5.97,CLOTEN,"Come hither: ah, you precious pander! Villain,"
30538,Cymbeline,26,3.5.98,CLOTEN,"Where is thy lady? In a word, or else"
30539,Cymbeline,26,3.5.99,CLOTEN,Thou art straightway with the fiends.
30540,Cymbeline,27,3.5.100,PISANIO,"O, good my lord!"
30541,Cymbeline,28,3.5.101,CLOTEN,"Where is thy lady? Or, by Jupiter,--"
30542,Cymbeline,28,3.5.102,CLOTEN,"I will not ask again. Close villain,"
30543,Cymbeline,28,3.5.103,CLOTEN,"I'll have this secret from thy heart, or rip"
30544,Cymbeline,28,3.5.104,CLOTEN,Thy heart to find it. Is she with Posthumus?
30545,Cymbeline,28,3.5.105,CLOTEN,From whose so many weights of baseness cannot
30546,Cymbeline,28,3.5.106,CLOTEN,A dram of worth be drawn.
30547,Cymbeline,29,3.5.107,PISANIO,"Alas, my lord,"
30548,Cymbeline,29,3.5.108,PISANIO,How can she be with him? When was she missed?
30549,Cymbeline,29,3.5.109,PISANIO,He is in Rome.
30550,Cymbeline,30,3.5.110,CLOTEN,"Where is she, sir? Come nearer,"
30551,Cymbeline,30,3.5.111,CLOTEN,No further halting: satisfy me home
30552,Cymbeline,30,3.5.112,CLOTEN,What is become of her.
30553,Cymbeline,31,3.5.113,PISANIO,"O, my all-worthy lord!"
30554,Cymbeline,32,3.5.114,CLOTEN,All-worthy villain!
30555,Cymbeline,32,3.5.115,CLOTEN,"Discover where thy mistress is at once,"
30556,Cymbeline,32,3.5.116,CLOTEN,At the next word: no more of 'worthy lord!'
30557,Cymbeline,32,3.5.117,CLOTEN,"Speak, or thy silence on the instant is"
30558,Cymbeline,32,3.5.118,CLOTEN,Thy condemnation and thy death.
30559,Cymbeline,33,3.5.119,PISANIO,"Then, sir,"
30560,Cymbeline,33,3.5.120,PISANIO,This paper is the history of my knowledge
30561,Cymbeline,33,3.5.121,PISANIO,Touching her flight.
30562,Cymbeline,33,,PISANIO,Presenting a letter
30563,Cymbeline,34,3.5.122,CLOTEN,Let's see't. I will pursue her
30564,Cymbeline,34,3.5.123,CLOTEN,Even to Augustus' throne.
30565,Cymbeline,35,3.5.124,PISANIO,"[Aside]                 Or this, or perish."
30566,Cymbeline,35,3.5.125,PISANIO,"She's far enough, and what he learns by this"
30567,Cymbeline,35,3.5.126,PISANIO,"May prove his travel, not her danger."
30568,Cymbeline,36,3.5.127,CLOTEN,Hum!
30569,Cymbeline,37,3.5.128,PISANIO,"[Aside]  I'll write to my lord she's dead. O Imogen,"
30570,Cymbeline,37,3.5.129,PISANIO,"Safe mayst thou wander, safe return again!"
30571,Cymbeline,38,3.5.130,CLOTEN,"Sirrah, is this letter true?"
30572,Cymbeline,39,3.5.131,PISANIO,"Sir, as I think."
30573,Cymbeline,40,3.5.132,CLOTEN,"It is Posthumus' hand, I know't. Sirrah, if thou"
30574,Cymbeline,40,3.5.133,CLOTEN,"wouldst not be a villain, but do me true service,"
30575,Cymbeline,40,3.5.134,CLOTEN,undergo those employments wherein I should have
30576,Cymbeline,40,3.5.135,CLOTEN,"cause to use thee with a serious industry, that is,"
30577,Cymbeline,40,3.5.136,CLOTEN,"what villany soe'er I bid thee do, to perform it"
30578,Cymbeline,40,3.5.137,CLOTEN,"directly and truly, I would think thee an honest"
30579,Cymbeline,40,3.5.138,CLOTEN,man: thou shouldst neither want my means for thy
30580,Cymbeline,40,3.5.139,CLOTEN,relief nor my voice for thy preferment.
30581,Cymbeline,41,3.5.140,PISANIO,"Well, my good lord."
30582,Cymbeline,42,3.5.141,CLOTEN,Wilt thou serve me? for since patiently and
30583,Cymbeline,42,3.5.142,CLOTEN,constantly thou hast stuck to the bare fortune of
30584,Cymbeline,42,3.5.143,CLOTEN,"that beggar Posthumus, thou canst not, in the"
30585,Cymbeline,42,3.5.144,CLOTEN,"course of gratitude, but be a diligent follower of"
30586,Cymbeline,42,3.5.145,CLOTEN,mine: wilt thou serve me?
30587,Cymbeline,43,3.5.146,PISANIO,"Sir, I will."
30588,Cymbeline,44,3.5.147,CLOTEN,"Give me thy hand, here's my purse. Hast any of thy"
30589,Cymbeline,44,3.5.148,CLOTEN,late master's garments in thy possession?
30590,Cymbeline,45,3.5.149,PISANIO,"I have, my lord, at my lodging, the same suit he"
30591,Cymbeline,45,3.5.150,PISANIO,wore when he took leave of my lady and mistress.
30592,Cymbeline,46,3.5.151,CLOTEN,"The first service thou dost me, fetch that suit"
30593,Cymbeline,46,3.5.152,CLOTEN,"hither: let it be thy lint service, go."
30594,Cymbeline,47,3.5.153,PISANIO,"I shall, my lord."
30595,Cymbeline,47,,PISANIO,Exit
30596,Cymbeline,48,3.5.154,CLOTEN,Meet thee at Milford-Haven!--I forgot to ask him one
30597,Cymbeline,48,3.5.155,CLOTEN,"thing, I'll remember't anon:--even there, thou"
30598,Cymbeline,48,3.5.156,CLOTEN,"villain Posthumus, will I kill thee. I would these"
30599,Cymbeline,48,3.5.157,CLOTEN,garments were come. She said upon a time--the
30600,Cymbeline,48,3.5.158,CLOTEN,bitterness of it I now belch from my heart--that she
30601,Cymbeline,48,3.5.159,CLOTEN,held the very garment of Posthumus in more respect
30602,Cymbeline,48,3.5.160,CLOTEN,than my noble and natural person together with the
30603,Cymbeline,48,3.5.161,CLOTEN,adornment of my qualities. With that suit upon my
30604,Cymbeline,48,3.5.162,CLOTEN,"back, will I ravish her: first kill him, and in her"
30605,Cymbeline,48,3.5.163,CLOTEN,"eyes, there shall she see my valour, which will then"
30606,Cymbeline,48,3.5.164,CLOTEN,"be a torment to her contempt. He on the ground, my"
30607,Cymbeline,48,3.5.165,CLOTEN,"speech of insultment ended on his dead body, and"
30608,Cymbeline,48,3.5.166,CLOTEN,"when my lust hath dined,--which, as I say, to vex"
30609,Cymbeline,48,3.5.167,CLOTEN,her I will execute in the clothes that she so
30610,Cymbeline,48,3.5.168,CLOTEN,"praised,--to the court I'll knock her back, foot"
30611,Cymbeline,48,3.5.169,CLOTEN,"her home again. She hath despised me rejoicingly,"
30612,Cymbeline,48,3.5.170,CLOTEN,and I'll be merry in my revenge.
30613,Cymbeline,48,,CLOTEN,"Re-enter PISANIO, with the clothes"
30614,Cymbeline,48,3.5.171,CLOTEN,Be those the garments?
30615,Cymbeline,49,3.5.172,PISANIO,"Ay, my noble lord."
30616,Cymbeline,50,3.5.173,CLOTEN,How long is't since she went to Milford-Haven?
30617,Cymbeline,51,3.5.174,PISANIO,She can scarce be there yet.
30618,Cymbeline,52,3.5.175,CLOTEN,"Bring this apparel to my chamber, that is the second"
30619,Cymbeline,52,3.5.176,CLOTEN,"thing that I have commanded thee: the third is,"
30620,Cymbeline,52,3.5.177,CLOTEN,that thou wilt be a voluntary mute to my design. Be
30621,Cymbeline,52,3.5.178,CLOTEN,"but duteous, and true preferment shall tender itself"
30622,Cymbeline,52,3.5.179,CLOTEN,to thee. My revenge is now at Milford: would I had
30623,Cymbeline,52,3.5.180,CLOTEN,"wings to follow it! Come, and be true."
30624,Cymbeline,52,,CLOTEN,Exit
30625,Cymbeline,53,3.5.181,PISANIO,Thou bid'st me to my loss: for true to thee
30626,Cymbeline,53,3.5.182,PISANIO,"Were to prove false, which I will never be,"
30627,Cymbeline,53,3.5.183,PISANIO,"To him that is most true. To Milford go,"
30628,Cymbeline,53,3.5.184,PISANIO,"And find not her whom thou pursuest. Flow, flow,"
30629,Cymbeline,53,3.5.185,PISANIO,"You heavenly blessings, on her! This fool's speed"
30630,Cymbeline,53,3.5.186,PISANIO,"Be cross'd with slowness, labour be his meed!"
30631,Cymbeline,53,,PISANIO,Exit
30632,Cymbeline,53,,PISANIO,SCENE VI. Wales. Before the cave of Belarius.
30633,Cymbeline,53,,PISANIO,"Enter IMOGEN, in boy's clothes"
30634,Cymbeline,1,3.6.1,IMOGEN,I see a man's life is a tedious one:
30635,Cymbeline,1,3.6.2,IMOGEN,"I have tired myself, and for two nights together"
30636,Cymbeline,1,3.6.3,IMOGEN,"Have made the ground my bed. I should be sick,"
30637,Cymbeline,1,3.6.4,IMOGEN,"But that my resolution helps me. Milford,"
30638,Cymbeline,1,3.6.5,IMOGEN,"When from the mountain-top Pisanio show'd thee,"
30639,Cymbeline,1,3.6.6,IMOGEN,Thou wast within a ken: O Jove! I think
30640,Cymbeline,1,3.6.7,IMOGEN,"Foundations fly the wretched, such, I mean,"
30641,Cymbeline,1,3.6.8,IMOGEN,Where they should be relieved. Two beggars told me
30642,Cymbeline,1,3.6.9,IMOGEN,"I could not miss my way: will poor folks lie,"
30643,Cymbeline,1,3.6.10,IMOGEN,"That have afflictions on them, knowing 'tis"
30644,Cymbeline,1,3.6.11,IMOGEN,"A punishment or trial? Yes, no wonder,"
30645,Cymbeline,1,3.6.12,IMOGEN,When rich ones scarce tell true. To lapse in fulness
30646,Cymbeline,1,3.6.13,IMOGEN,"Is sorer than to lie for need, and falsehood"
30647,Cymbeline,1,3.6.14,IMOGEN,Is worse in kings than beggars. My dear lord!
30648,Cymbeline,1,3.6.15,IMOGEN,"Thou art one o' the false ones. Now I think on thee,"
30649,Cymbeline,1,3.6.16,IMOGEN,"My hunger's gone, but even before, I was"
30650,Cymbeline,1,3.6.17,IMOGEN,At point to sink for food. But what is this?
30651,Cymbeline,1,3.6.18,IMOGEN,Here is a path to't: 'tis some savage hold:
30652,Cymbeline,1,3.6.19,IMOGEN,"I were best not to call, I dare not call:"
30653,Cymbeline,1,3.6.20,IMOGEN,"yet famine,"
30654,Cymbeline,1,3.6.21,IMOGEN,"Ere clean it o'erthrow nature, makes it valiant,"
30655,Cymbeline,1,3.6.22,IMOGEN,Plenty and peace breeds cowards: hardness ever
30656,Cymbeline,1,3.6.23,IMOGEN,Of hardiness is mother. Ho! who's here?
30657,Cymbeline,1,3.6.24,IMOGEN,"If any thing that's civil, speak, if savage,"
30658,Cymbeline,1,3.6.25,IMOGEN,Take or lend. Ho! No answer? Then I'll enter.
30659,Cymbeline,1,3.6.26,IMOGEN,Best draw my sword: and if mine enemy
30660,Cymbeline,1,3.6.27,IMOGEN,"But fear the sword like me, he'll scarcely look on't."
30661,Cymbeline,1,3.6.28,IMOGEN,"Such a foe, good heavens!"
30662,Cymbeline,1,,IMOGEN,"Exit, to the cave"
30663,Cymbeline,1,,IMOGEN,"Enter BELARIUS, GUIDERIUS, and ARVIRAGUS"
30664,Cymbeline,2,3.6.29,BELARIUS,"You, Polydote, have proved best woodman and"
30665,Cymbeline,2,3.6.30,BELARIUS,Are master of the feast: Cadwal and I
30666,Cymbeline,2,3.6.31,BELARIUS,"Will play the cook and servant, 'tis our match:"
30667,Cymbeline,2,3.6.32,BELARIUS,"The sweat of industry would dry and die,"
30668,Cymbeline,2,3.6.33,BELARIUS,"But for the end it works to. Come, our stomachs"
30669,Cymbeline,2,3.6.34,BELARIUS,Will make what's homely savoury: weariness
30670,Cymbeline,2,3.6.35,BELARIUS,"Can snore upon the flint, when resty sloth"
30671,Cymbeline,2,3.6.36,BELARIUS,"Finds the down pillow hard. Now peace be here,"
30672,Cymbeline,2,3.6.37,BELARIUS,"Poor house, that keep'st thyself!"
30673,Cymbeline,3,3.6.38,GUIDERIUS,I am thoroughly weary.
30674,Cymbeline,4,3.6.39,ARVIRAGUS,"I am weak with toil, yet strong in appetite."
30675,Cymbeline,5,3.6.40,GUIDERIUS,"There is cold meat i' the cave, we'll browse on that,"
30676,Cymbeline,5,3.6.41,GUIDERIUS,Whilst what we have kill'd be cook'd.
30677,Cymbeline,6,3.6.42,BELARIUS,[Looking into the cave]
30678,Cymbeline,6,3.6.43,BELARIUS,"Stay, come not in."
30679,Cymbeline,6,3.6.44,BELARIUS,"But that it eats our victuals, I should think"
30680,Cymbeline,6,3.6.45,BELARIUS,Here were a fairy.
30681,Cymbeline,7,3.6.46,GUIDERIUS,"What's the matter, sir?"
30682,Cymbeline,8,3.6.47,BELARIUS,"By Jupiter, an angel! or, if not,"
30683,Cymbeline,8,3.6.48,BELARIUS,An earthly paragon! Behold divineness
30684,Cymbeline,8,3.6.49,BELARIUS,No elder than a boy!
30685,Cymbeline,8,,BELARIUS,Re-enter IMOGEN
30686,Cymbeline,9,3.6.50,IMOGEN,"Good masters, harm me not:"
30687,Cymbeline,9,3.6.51,IMOGEN,"Before I enter'd here, I call'd, and thought"
30688,Cymbeline,9,3.6.52,IMOGEN,To have begg'd or bought what I have took:
30689,Cymbeline,9,3.6.53,IMOGEN,"good troth,"
30690,Cymbeline,9,3.6.54,IMOGEN,"I have stol'n nought, nor would not, though I had found"
30691,Cymbeline,9,3.6.55,IMOGEN,Gold strew'd i' the floor. Here's money for my meat:
30692,Cymbeline,9,3.6.56,IMOGEN,I would have left it on the board so soon
30693,Cymbeline,9,3.6.57,IMOGEN,"As I had made my meal, and parted"
30694,Cymbeline,9,3.6.58,IMOGEN,With prayers for the provider.
30695,Cymbeline,10,3.6.59,GUIDERIUS,"Money, youth?"
30696,Cymbeline,11,3.6.60,ARVIRAGUS,All gold and silver rather turn to dirt!
30697,Cymbeline,11,3.6.61,ARVIRAGUS,"As 'tis no better reckon'd, but of those"
30698,Cymbeline,11,3.6.62,ARVIRAGUS,Who worship dirty gods.
30699,Cymbeline,12,3.6.63,IMOGEN,I see you're angry:
30700,Cymbeline,12,3.6.64,IMOGEN,"Know, if you kill me for my fault, I should"
30701,Cymbeline,12,3.6.65,IMOGEN,Have died had I not made it.
30702,Cymbeline,13,3.6.66,BELARIUS,Whither bound?
30703,Cymbeline,14,3.6.67,IMOGEN,To Milford-Haven.
30704,Cymbeline,15,3.6.68,BELARIUS,What's your name?
30705,Cymbeline,16,3.6.69,IMOGEN,"Fidele, sir. I have a kinsman who"
30706,Cymbeline,16,3.6.70,IMOGEN,"Is bound for Italy, he embark'd at Milford,"
30707,Cymbeline,16,3.6.71,IMOGEN,"To whom being going, almost spent with hunger,"
30708,Cymbeline,16,3.6.72,IMOGEN,I am fall'n in this offence.
30709,Cymbeline,17,3.6.73,BELARIUS,"Prithee, fair youth,"
30710,Cymbeline,17,3.6.74,BELARIUS,"Think us no churls, nor measure our good minds"
30711,Cymbeline,17,3.6.75,BELARIUS,By this rude place we live in. Well encounter'd!
30712,Cymbeline,17,3.6.76,BELARIUS,'Tis almost night: you shall have better cheer
30713,Cymbeline,17,3.6.77,BELARIUS,Ere you depart: and thanks to stay and eat it.
30714,Cymbeline,17,3.6.78,BELARIUS,"Boys, bid him welcome."
30715,Cymbeline,18,3.6.79,GUIDERIUS,"Were you a woman, youth,"
30716,Cymbeline,18,3.6.80,GUIDERIUS,"I should woo hard but be your groom. In honesty,"
30717,Cymbeline,18,3.6.81,GUIDERIUS,I bid for you as I'd buy.
30718,Cymbeline,19,3.6.82,ARVIRAGUS,I'll make't my comfort
30719,Cymbeline,19,3.6.83,ARVIRAGUS,"He is a man, I'll love him as my brother:"
30720,Cymbeline,19,3.6.84,ARVIRAGUS,And such a welcome as I'd give to him
30721,Cymbeline,19,3.6.85,ARVIRAGUS,"After long absence, such is yours: most welcome!"
30722,Cymbeline,19,3.6.86,ARVIRAGUS,"Be sprightly, for you fall 'mongst friends."
30723,Cymbeline,20,3.6.87,IMOGEN,"'Mongst friends,"
30724,Cymbeline,20,3.6.88,IMOGEN,If brothers.
30725,Cymbeline,20,,IMOGEN,Aside
30726,Cymbeline,20,3.6.89,IMOGEN,"Would it had been so, that they"
30727,Cymbeline,20,3.6.90,IMOGEN,Had been my father's sons! then had my prize
30728,Cymbeline,20,3.6.91,IMOGEN,"Been less, and so more equal ballasting"
30729,Cymbeline,20,3.6.92,IMOGEN,"To thee, Posthumus."
30730,Cymbeline,21,3.6.93,BELARIUS,He wrings at some distress.
30731,Cymbeline,22,3.6.94,GUIDERIUS,Would I could free't!
30732,Cymbeline,23,3.6.95,ARVIRAGUS,"Or I, whate'er it be,"
30733,Cymbeline,23,3.6.96,ARVIRAGUS,"What pain it cost, what danger. God's!"
30734,Cymbeline,24,3.6.97,BELARIUS,"Hark, boys."
30735,Cymbeline,24,,BELARIUS,Whispering
30736,Cymbeline,25,3.6.98,IMOGEN,"Great men,"
30737,Cymbeline,25,3.6.99,IMOGEN,"That had a court no bigger than this cave,"
30738,Cymbeline,25,3.6.100,IMOGEN,That did attend themselves and had the virtue
30739,Cymbeline,25,3.6.101,IMOGEN,Which their own conscience seal'd them--laying by
30740,Cymbeline,25,3.6.102,IMOGEN,That nothing-gift of differing multitudes--
30741,Cymbeline,25,3.6.103,IMOGEN,"Could not out-peer these twain. Pardon me, gods!"
30742,Cymbeline,25,3.6.104,IMOGEN,"I'd change my sex to be companion with them,"

30744,Cymbeline,26,3.6.106,BELARIUS,It shall be so.
30745,Cymbeline,26,3.6.107,BELARIUS,"Boys, we'll go dress our hunt. Fair youth, come in:"
30746,Cymbeline,26,3.6.108,BELARIUS,"Discourse is heavy, fasting, when we have supp'd,"
30747,Cymbeline,26,3.6.109,BELARIUS,"We'll mannerly demand thee of thy story,"
30748,Cymbeline,26,3.6.110,BELARIUS,So far as thou wilt speak it.
30749,Cymbeline,27,3.6.111,GUIDERIUS,"Pray, draw near."
30750,Cymbeline,28,3.6.112,ARVIRAGUS,The night to the owl and morn to the lark
30751,Cymbeline,28,3.6.113,ARVIRAGUS,less welcome.

30756,Cymbeline,30,,ARVIRAGUS,Enter two Senators and Tribunes
30757,Cymbeline,1,3.7.1,First Senator,This is the tenor of the emperor's writ:
30758,Cymbeline,1,3.7.2,First Senator,That since the common men are now in action
30759,Cymbeline,1,3.7.3,First Senator,"'Gainst the Pannonians and Dalmatians,"
30760,Cymbeline,1,3.7.4,First Senator,And that the legions now in Gallia are
30761,Cymbeline,1,3.7.5,First Senator,Full weak to undertake our wars against
30762,Cymbeline,1,3.7.6,First Senator,"The fall'n-off Britons, that we do incite"
30763,Cymbeline,1,3.7.7,First Senator,The gentry to this business. He creates
30764,Cymbeline,1,3.7.8,First Senator,"Lucius preconsul: and to you the tribunes,"
30765,Cymbeline,1,3.7.9,First Senator,"For this immediate levy, he commends"
30766,Cymbeline,1,3.7.10,First Senator,His absolute commission. Long live Caesar!
30767,Cymbeline,2,3.7.11,First Tribune,Is Lucius general of the forces?
30768,Cymbeline,3,3.7.12,Second Senator,Ay.
30769,Cymbeline,4,3.7.13,First Tribune,Remaining now in Gallia?
30770,Cymbeline,5,3.7.14,First Senator,With those legions
30771,Cymbeline,5,3.7.15,First Senator,"Which I have spoke of, whereunto your levy"
30772,Cymbeline,5,3.7.16,First Senator,Must be supplyant: the words of your commission
30773,Cymbeline,5,3.7.17,First Senator,Will tie you to the numbers and the time
30774,Cymbeline,5,3.7.18,First Senator,Of their dispatch.

30779,Cymbeline,6,,First Tribune,Enter CLOTEN
30780,Cymbeline,1,4.1.1,CLOTEN,"I am near to the place where they should meet, if"
30781,Cymbeline,1,4.1.2,CLOTEN,Pisanio have mapped it truly. How fit his garments
30782,Cymbeline,1,4.1.3,CLOTEN,"serve me! Why should his mistress, who was made by"
30783,Cymbeline,1,4.1.4,CLOTEN,"him that made the tailor, not be fit too? the"
30784,Cymbeline,1,4.1.5,CLOTEN,rather--saving reverence of the word--for 'tis said
30785,Cymbeline,1,4.1.6,CLOTEN,a woman's fitness comes by fits. Therein I must
30786,Cymbeline,1,4.1.7,CLOTEN,play the workman. I dare speak it to myself--for it
30787,Cymbeline,1,4.1.8,CLOTEN,is not vain-glory for a man and his glass to confer
30788,Cymbeline,1,4.1.9,CLOTEN,"in his own chamber--I mean, the lines of my body are"
30789,Cymbeline,1,4.1.10,CLOTEN,"as well drawn as his, no less young, more strong,"
30790,Cymbeline,1,4.1.11,CLOTEN,"not beneath him in fortunes, beyond him in the"
30791,Cymbeline,1,4.1.12,CLOTEN,"advantage of the time, above him in birth, alike"
30792,Cymbeline,1,4.1.13,CLOTEN,"conversant in general services, and more remarkable"
30793,Cymbeline,1,4.1.14,CLOTEN,in single oppositions: yet this imperceiverant
30794,Cymbeline,1,4.1.15,CLOTEN,thing loves him in my despite. What mortality is!
30795,Cymbeline,1,4.1.16,CLOTEN,"Posthumus, thy head, which now is growing upon thy"
30796,Cymbeline,1,4.1.17,CLOTEN,"shoulders, shall within this hour be off, thy"
30797,Cymbeline,1,4.1.18,CLOTEN,"mistress enforced, thy garments cut to pieces before"
30798,Cymbeline,1,4.1.19,CLOTEN,"thy face: and all this done, spurn her home to her"
30799,Cymbeline,1,4.1.20,CLOTEN,"father, who may haply be a little angry for my so"
30800,Cymbeline,1,4.1.21,CLOTEN,"rough usage, but my mother, having power of his"
30801,Cymbeline,1,4.1.22,CLOTEN,"testiness, shall turn all into my commendations. My"
30802,Cymbeline,1,4.1.23,CLOTEN,"horse is tied up safe: out, sword, and to a sore"
30803,Cymbeline,1,4.1.24,CLOTEN,"purpose! Fortune, put them into my hand! This is"
30804,Cymbeline,1,4.1.25,CLOTEN,"the very description of their meeting-place, and"
30805,Cymbeline,1,4.1.26,CLOTEN,the fellow dares not deceive me.
30806,Cymbeline,1,,CLOTEN,Exit
30807,Cymbeline,1,,CLOTEN,SCENE II. Before the cave of Belarius.
30808,Cymbeline,1,,CLOTEN,"Enter, from the cave, BELARIUS, GUIDERIUS, ARVIRAGUS, and IMOGEN"
30809,Cymbeline,1,4.2.1,BELARIUS,"[To IMOGEN]  You are not well: remain here in the cave,"
30810,Cymbeline,1,4.2.2,BELARIUS,We'll come to you after hunting.
30811,Cymbeline,2,4.2.3,ARVIRAGUS,"[To IMOGEN]	Brother, stay here"
30812,Cymbeline,2,4.2.4,ARVIRAGUS,Are we not brothers?
30813,Cymbeline,3,4.2.5,IMOGEN,"So man and man should be,"
30814,Cymbeline,3,4.2.6,IMOGEN,"But clay and clay differs in dignity,"
30815,Cymbeline,3,4.2.7,IMOGEN,Whose dust is both alike. I am very sick.
30816,Cymbeline,4,4.2.8,GUIDERIUS,"Go you to hunting, I'll abide with him."
30817,Cymbeline,5,4.2.9,IMOGEN,"So sick I am not, yet I am not well,"
30818,Cymbeline,5,4.2.10,IMOGEN,But not so citizen a wanton as
30819,Cymbeline,5,4.2.11,IMOGEN,"To seem to die ere sick: so please you, leave me,"
30820,Cymbeline,5,4.2.12,IMOGEN,Stick to your journal course: the breach of custom
30821,Cymbeline,5,4.2.13,IMOGEN,"Is breach of all. I am ill, but your being by me"
30822,Cymbeline,5,4.2.14,IMOGEN,"Cannot amend me, society is no comfort"
30823,Cymbeline,5,4.2.15,IMOGEN,"To one not sociable: I am not very sick,"
30824,Cymbeline,5,4.2.16,IMOGEN,"Since I can reason of it. Pray you, trust me here:"
30825,Cymbeline,5,4.2.17,IMOGEN,"I'll rob none but myself, and let me die,"
30826,Cymbeline,5,4.2.18,IMOGEN,Stealing so poorly.
30827,Cymbeline,6,4.2.19,GUIDERIUS,"I love thee, I have spoke it"
30828,Cymbeline,6,4.2.20,GUIDERIUS,"How much the quantity, the weight as much,"
30829,Cymbeline,6,4.2.21,GUIDERIUS,As I do love my father.
30830,Cymbeline,7,4.2.22,BELARIUS,What! how! how!
30831,Cymbeline,8,4.2.23,ARVIRAGUS,"If it be sin to say so, I yoke me"
30832,Cymbeline,8,4.2.24,ARVIRAGUS,In my good brother's fault: I know not why
30833,Cymbeline,8,4.2.25,ARVIRAGUS,"I love this youth, and I have heard you say,"
30834,Cymbeline,8,4.2.26,ARVIRAGUS,"Love's reason's without reason: the bier at door,"
30835,Cymbeline,8,4.2.27,ARVIRAGUS,"And a demand who is't shall die, I'd say"
30836,Cymbeline,8,4.2.28,ARVIRAGUS,"'My father, not this youth.'"
30837,Cymbeline,9,4.2.29,BELARIUS,"[Aside]	O noble strain!"
30838,Cymbeline,9,4.2.30,BELARIUS,O worthiness of nature! breed of greatness!
30839,Cymbeline,9,4.2.31,BELARIUS,Cowards father cowards and base things sire base:
30840,Cymbeline,9,4.2.32,BELARIUS,"Nature hath meal and bran, contempt and grace."
30841,Cymbeline,9,4.2.33,BELARIUS,"I'm not their father, yet who this should be,"
30842,Cymbeline,9,4.2.34,BELARIUS,"Doth miracle itself, loved before me."
30843,Cymbeline,9,4.2.35,BELARIUS,'Tis the ninth hour o' the morn.
30844,Cymbeline,10,4.2.36,ARVIRAGUS,"Brother, farewell."
30845,Cymbeline,11,4.2.37,IMOGEN,I wish ye sport.
30846,Cymbeline,12,4.2.38,ARVIRAGUS,"You health. So please you, sir."
30847,Cymbeline,13,4.2.39,IMOGEN,"[Aside]  These are kind creatures. Gods, what lies"
30848,Cymbeline,13,4.2.40,IMOGEN,I have heard!
30849,Cymbeline,13,4.2.41,IMOGEN,Our courtiers say all's savage but at court:
30850,Cymbeline,13,4.2.42,IMOGEN,"Experience, O, thou disprovest report!"
30851,Cymbeline,13,4.2.43,IMOGEN,"The imperious seas breed monsters, for the dish"
30852,Cymbeline,13,4.2.44,IMOGEN,Poor tributary rivers as sweet fish.
30853,Cymbeline,13,4.2.45,IMOGEN,"I am sick still, heart-sick. Pisanio,"
30854,Cymbeline,13,4.2.46,IMOGEN,I'll now taste of thy drug.
30855,Cymbeline,13,,IMOGEN,Swallows some
30856,Cymbeline,14,4.2.47,GUIDERIUS,I could not stir him:
30857,Cymbeline,14,4.2.48,GUIDERIUS,"He said he was gentle, but unfortunate,"
30858,Cymbeline,14,4.2.49,GUIDERIUS,"Dishonestly afflicted, but yet honest."
30859,Cymbeline,15,4.2.50,ARVIRAGUS,"Thus did he answer me: yet said, hereafter"
30860,Cymbeline,15,4.2.51,ARVIRAGUS,I might know more.
30861,Cymbeline,16,4.2.52,BELARIUS,"To the field, to the field!"
30862,Cymbeline,16,4.2.53,BELARIUS,We'll leave you for this time: go in and rest.
30863,Cymbeline,17,4.2.54,ARVIRAGUS,We'll not be long away.
30864,Cymbeline,18,4.2.55,BELARIUS,"Pray, be not sick,"
30865,Cymbeline,18,4.2.56,BELARIUS,For you must be our housewife.
30866,Cymbeline,19,4.2.57,IMOGEN,"Well or ill,"
30867,Cymbeline,19,4.2.58,IMOGEN,I am bound to you.
30868,Cymbeline,20,4.2.59,BELARIUS,And shalt be ever.
30869,Cymbeline,20,,BELARIUS,"Exit IMOGEN, to the cave"
30870,Cymbeline,20,4.2.60,BELARIUS,"This youth, how'er distress'd, appears he hath had"
30871,Cymbeline,20,4.2.61,BELARIUS,Good ancestors.
30872,Cymbeline,21,4.2.62,ARVIRAGUS,How angel-like he sings!
30873,Cymbeline,22,4.2.63,GUIDERIUS,But his neat cookery! he cut our roots
30874,Cymbeline,22,4.2.64,GUIDERIUS,"In characters,"
30875,Cymbeline,22,4.2.65,GUIDERIUS,"And sauced our broths, as Juno had been sick"
30876,Cymbeline,22,4.2.66,GUIDERIUS,And he her dieter.
30877,Cymbeline,23,4.2.67,ARVIRAGUS,Nobly he yokes
30878,Cymbeline,23,4.2.68,ARVIRAGUS,"A smiling with a sigh, as if the sigh"
30879,Cymbeline,23,4.2.69,ARVIRAGUS,"Was that it was, for not being such a smile,"
30880,Cymbeline,23,4.2.70,ARVIRAGUS,"The smile mocking the sigh, that it would fly"
30881,Cymbeline,23,4.2.71,ARVIRAGUS,"From so divine a temple, to commix"
30882,Cymbeline,23,4.2.72,ARVIRAGUS,With winds that sailors rail at.
30883,Cymbeline,24,4.2.73,GUIDERIUS,I do note
30884,Cymbeline,24,4.2.74,GUIDERIUS,"That grief and patience, rooted in him both,"
30885,Cymbeline,24,4.2.75,GUIDERIUS,Mingle their spurs together.
30886,Cymbeline,25,4.2.76,ARVIRAGUS,"Grow, patience!"
30887,Cymbeline,25,4.2.77,ARVIRAGUS,"And let the stinking elder, grief, untwine"
30888,Cymbeline,25,4.2.78,ARVIRAGUS,His perishing root with the increasing vine!
30889,Cymbeline,26,4.2.79,BELARIUS,"It is great morning. Come, away!--"
30890,Cymbeline,26,4.2.80,BELARIUS,Who's there?
30891,Cymbeline,26,,BELARIUS,Enter CLOTEN
30892,Cymbeline,27,4.2.81,CLOTEN,"I cannot find those runagates, that villain"
30893,Cymbeline,27,4.2.82,CLOTEN,Hath mock'd me. I am faint.
30894,Cymbeline,28,4.2.83,BELARIUS,'Those runagates!'
30895,Cymbeline,28,4.2.84,BELARIUS,Means he not us? I partly know him: 'tis
30896,Cymbeline,28,4.2.85,BELARIUS,"Cloten, the son o' the queen. I fear some ambush."
30897,Cymbeline,28,4.2.86,BELARIUS,"I saw him not these many years, and yet"
30898,Cymbeline,28,4.2.87,BELARIUS,I know 'tis he. We are held as outlaws: hence!
30899,Cymbeline,29,4.2.88,GUIDERIUS,He is but one: you and my brother search
30900,Cymbeline,29,4.2.89,GUIDERIUS,"What companies are near: pray you, away,"
30901,Cymbeline,29,4.2.90,GUIDERIUS,Let me alone with him.
30902,Cymbeline,29,,GUIDERIUS,Exeunt BELARIUS and ARVIRAGUS
30903,Cymbeline,30,4.2.91,CLOTEN,Soft! What are you
30904,Cymbeline,30,4.2.92,CLOTEN,That fly me thus? some villain mountaineers?
30905,Cymbeline,30,4.2.93,CLOTEN,I have heard of such. What slave art thou?
30906,Cymbeline,31,4.2.94,GUIDERIUS,A thing
30907,Cymbeline,31,4.2.95,GUIDERIUS,More slavish did I ne'er than answering
30908,Cymbeline,31,4.2.96,GUIDERIUS,A slave without a knock.
30909,Cymbeline,32,4.2.97,CLOTEN,"Thou art a robber,"
30910,Cymbeline,32,4.2.98,CLOTEN,"A law-breaker, a villain: yield thee, thief."
30911,Cymbeline,33,4.2.99,GUIDERIUS,To who? to thee? What art thou? Have not I
30912,Cymbeline,33,4.2.100,GUIDERIUS,An arm as big as thine? a heart as big?
30913,Cymbeline,33,4.2.101,GUIDERIUS,"Thy words, I grant, are bigger, for I wear not"
30914,Cymbeline,33,4.2.102,GUIDERIUS,"My dagger in my mouth. Say what thou art,"
30915,Cymbeline,33,4.2.103,GUIDERIUS,Why I should yield to thee?
30916,Cymbeline,34,4.2.104,CLOTEN,"Thou villain base,"
30917,Cymbeline,34,4.2.105,CLOTEN,Know'st me not by my clothes?
30918,Cymbeline,35,4.2.106,GUIDERIUS,"No, nor thy tailor, rascal,"
30919,Cymbeline,35,4.2.107,GUIDERIUS,"Who is thy grandfather: he made those clothes,"
30920,Cymbeline,35,4.2.108,GUIDERIUS,"Which, as it seems, make thee."
30921,Cymbeline,36,4.2.109,CLOTEN,"Thou precious varlet,"
30922,Cymbeline,36,4.2.110,CLOTEN,My tailor made them not.
30923,Cymbeline,37,4.2.111,GUIDERIUS,"Hence, then, and thank"
30924,Cymbeline,37,4.2.112,GUIDERIUS,"The man that gave them thee. Thou art some fool,"
30925,Cymbeline,37,4.2.113,GUIDERIUS,I am loath to beat thee.
30926,Cymbeline,38,4.2.114,CLOTEN,"Thou injurious thief,"
30927,Cymbeline,38,4.2.115,CLOTEN,"Hear but my name, and tremble."
30928,Cymbeline,39,4.2.116,GUIDERIUS,What's thy name?
30929,Cymbeline,40,4.2.117,CLOTEN,"Cloten, thou villain."
30930,Cymbeline,41,4.2.118,GUIDERIUS,"Cloten, thou double villain, be thy name,"
30931,Cymbeline,41,4.2.119,GUIDERIUS,"I cannot tremble at it: were it Toad, or"
30932,Cymbeline,41,4.2.120,GUIDERIUS,"Adder, Spider,"
30933,Cymbeline,41,4.2.121,GUIDERIUS,'Twould move me sooner.
30934,Cymbeline,42,4.2.122,CLOTEN,"To thy further fear,"
30935,Cymbeline,42,4.2.123,CLOTEN,"Nay, to thy mere confusion, thou shalt know"
30936,Cymbeline,42,4.2.124,CLOTEN,I am son to the queen.
30937,Cymbeline,43,4.2.125,GUIDERIUS,"I am sorry for 't, not seeming"
30938,Cymbeline,43,4.2.126,GUIDERIUS,So worthy as thy birth.
30939,Cymbeline,44,4.2.127,CLOTEN,Art not afeard?
30940,Cymbeline,45,4.2.128,GUIDERIUS,"Those that I reverence those I fear, the wise:"
30941,Cymbeline,45,4.2.129,GUIDERIUS,"At fools I laugh, not fear them."
30942,Cymbeline,46,4.2.130,CLOTEN,Die the death:
30943,Cymbeline,46,4.2.131,CLOTEN,"When I have slain thee with my proper hand,"
30944,Cymbeline,46,4.2.132,CLOTEN,"I'll follow those that even now fled hence,"
30945,Cymbeline,46,4.2.133,CLOTEN,And on the gates of Lud's-town set your heads:
30946,Cymbeline,46,4.2.134,CLOTEN,"Yield, rustic mountaineer."
30947,Cymbeline,46,,CLOTEN,"Exeunt, fighting"
30948,Cymbeline,46,,CLOTEN,Re-enter BELARIUS and ARVIRAGUS
30949,Cymbeline,47,4.2.135,BELARIUS,No companies abroad?
30950,Cymbeline,48,4.2.136,ARVIRAGUS,"None in the world: you did mistake him, sure."
30951,Cymbeline,49,4.2.137,BELARIUS,"I cannot tell: long is it since I saw him,"
30952,Cymbeline,49,4.2.138,BELARIUS,But time hath nothing blurr'd those lines of favour
30953,Cymbeline,49,4.2.139,BELARIUS,"Which then he wore, the snatches in his voice,"
30954,Cymbeline,49,4.2.140,BELARIUS,"And burst of speaking, were as his: I am absolute"
30955,Cymbeline,49,4.2.141,BELARIUS,'Twas very Cloten.
30956,Cymbeline,50,4.2.142,ARVIRAGUS,In this place we left them:

30958,Cymbeline,50,4.2.144,ARVIRAGUS,You say he is so fell.
30959,Cymbeline,51,4.2.145,BELARIUS,"Being scarce made up,"
30960,Cymbeline,51,4.2.146,BELARIUS,"I mean, to man, he had not apprehension"
30961,Cymbeline,51,4.2.147,BELARIUS,"Of roaring terrors, for the effect of judgment"
30962,Cymbeline,51,4.2.148,BELARIUS,"Is oft the cause of fear. But, see, thy brother."
30963,Cymbeline,51,,BELARIUS,"Re-enter GUIDERIUS, with CLOTEN'S head"
30964,Cymbeline,52,4.2.149,GUIDERIUS,"This Cloten was a fool, an empty purse,"
30965,Cymbeline,52,4.2.150,GUIDERIUS,There was no money in't: not Hercules
30966,Cymbeline,52,4.2.151,GUIDERIUS,"Could have knock'd out his brains, for he had none:"
30967,Cymbeline,52,4.2.152,GUIDERIUS,"Yet I not doing this, the fool had borne"
30968,Cymbeline,52,4.2.153,GUIDERIUS,My head as I do his.
30969,Cymbeline,53,4.2.154,BELARIUS,What hast thou done?
30970,Cymbeline,54,4.2.155,GUIDERIUS,"I am perfect what: cut off one Cloten's head,"
30971,Cymbeline,54,4.2.156,GUIDERIUS,"Son to the queen, after his own report,"
30972,Cymbeline,54,4.2.157,GUIDERIUS,"Who call'd me traitor, mountaineer, and swore"
30973,Cymbeline,54,4.2.158,GUIDERIUS,With his own single hand he'ld take us in
30974,Cymbeline,54,4.2.159,GUIDERIUS,"Displace our heads where--thank the gods!--they grow,"
30975,Cymbeline,54,4.2.160,GUIDERIUS,And set them on Lud's-town.
30976,Cymbeline,55,4.2.161,BELARIUS,We are all undone.
30977,Cymbeline,56,4.2.162,GUIDERIUS,"Why, worthy father, what have we to lose,"
30978,Cymbeline,56,4.2.163,GUIDERIUS,"But that he swore to take, our lives? The law"
30979,Cymbeline,56,4.2.164,GUIDERIUS,Protects not us: then why should we be tender
30980,Cymbeline,56,4.2.165,GUIDERIUS,"To let an arrogant piece of flesh threat us,"
30981,Cymbeline,56,4.2.166,GUIDERIUS,"Play judge and executioner all himself,"
30982,Cymbeline,56,4.2.167,GUIDERIUS,For we do fear the law? What company
30983,Cymbeline,56,4.2.168,GUIDERIUS,Discover you abroad?
30984,Cymbeline,57,4.2.169,BELARIUS,No single soul
30985,Cymbeline,57,4.2.170,BELARIUS,"Can we set eye on, but in all safe reason"
30986,Cymbeline,57,4.2.171,BELARIUS,He must have some attendants. Though his humour
30987,Cymbeline,57,4.2.172,BELARIUS,"Was nothing but mutation, ay, and that"
30988,Cymbeline,57,4.2.173,BELARIUS,"From one bad thing to worse, not frenzy, not"
30989,Cymbeline,57,4.2.174,BELARIUS,Absolute madness could so far have raved
30990,Cymbeline,57,4.2.175,BELARIUS,"To bring him here alone, although perhaps"
30991,Cymbeline,57,4.2.176,BELARIUS,It may be heard at court that such as we
30992,Cymbeline,57,4.2.177,BELARIUS,"Cave here, hunt here, are outlaws, and in time"
30993,Cymbeline,57,4.2.178,BELARIUS,"May make some stronger head, the which he hearing--"
30994,Cymbeline,57,4.2.179,BELARIUS,"As it is like him--might break out, and swear"
30995,Cymbeline,57,4.2.180,BELARIUS,"He'ld fetch us in, yet is't not probable"
30996,Cymbeline,57,4.2.181,BELARIUS,"To come alone, either he so undertaking,"
30997,Cymbeline,57,4.2.182,BELARIUS,"Or they so suffering: then on good ground we fear,"
30998,Cymbeline,57,4.2.183,BELARIUS,If we do fear this body hath a tail
30999,Cymbeline,57,4.2.184,BELARIUS,More perilous than the head.
31000,Cymbeline,58,4.2.185,ARVIRAGUS,Let ordinance
31001,Cymbeline,58,4.2.186,ARVIRAGUS,"Come as the gods foresay it: howsoe'er,"
31002,Cymbeline,58,4.2.187,ARVIRAGUS,My brother hath done well.
31003,Cymbeline,59,4.2.188,BELARIUS,I had no mind
31004,Cymbeline,59,4.2.189,BELARIUS,To hunt this day: the boy Fidele's sickness
31005,Cymbeline,59,4.2.190,BELARIUS,Did make my way long forth.
31006,Cymbeline,60,4.2.191,GUIDERIUS,"With his own sword,"
31007,Cymbeline,60,4.2.192,GUIDERIUS,"Which he did wave against my throat, I have ta'en"
31008,Cymbeline,60,4.2.193,GUIDERIUS,His head from him: I'll throw't into the creek
31009,Cymbeline,60,4.2.194,GUIDERIUS,"Behind our rock, and let it to the sea,"
31010,Cymbeline,60,4.2.195,GUIDERIUS,"And tell the fishes he's the queen's son, Cloten:"
31011,Cymbeline,60,4.2.196,GUIDERIUS,That's all I reck.
31012,Cymbeline,60,,GUIDERIUS,Exit
31013,Cymbeline,61,4.2.197,BELARIUS,I fear 'twill be revenged:
31014,Cymbeline,61,4.2.198,BELARIUS,"Would, Polydote, thou hadst not done't! though valour"
31015,Cymbeline,61,4.2.199,BELARIUS,Becomes thee well enough.
31016,Cymbeline,62,4.2.200,ARVIRAGUS,Would I had done't
31017,Cymbeline,62,4.2.201,ARVIRAGUS,"So the revenge alone pursued me! Polydore,"
31018,Cymbeline,62,4.2.202,ARVIRAGUS,"I love thee brotherly, but envy much"
31019,Cymbeline,62,4.2.203,ARVIRAGUS,"Thou hast robb'd me of this deed: I would revenges,"
31020,Cymbeline,62,4.2.204,ARVIRAGUS,"That possible strength might meet, would seek us through"
31021,Cymbeline,62,4.2.205,ARVIRAGUS,And put us to our answer.
31022,Cymbeline,63,4.2.206,BELARIUS,"Well, 'tis done:"
31023,Cymbeline,63,4.2.207,BELARIUS,"We'll hunt no more to-day, nor seek for danger"
31024,Cymbeline,63,4.2.208,BELARIUS,"Where there's no profit. I prithee, to our rock,"
31025,Cymbeline,63,4.2.209,BELARIUS,You and Fidele play the cooks: I'll stay
31026,Cymbeline,63,4.2.210,BELARIUS,"Till hasty Polydote return, and bring him"
31027,Cymbeline,63,4.2.211,BELARIUS,To dinner presently.
31028,Cymbeline,64,4.2.212,ARVIRAGUS,Poor sick Fidele!
31029,Cymbeline,64,4.2.213,ARVIRAGUS,I'll weringly to him: to gain his colour
31030,Cymbeline,64,4.2.214,ARVIRAGUS,"I'ld let a parish of such Clotens' blood,"
31031,Cymbeline,64,4.2.215,ARVIRAGUS,And praise myself for charity.
31032,Cymbeline,64,,ARVIRAGUS,Exit
31033,Cymbeline,65,4.2.216,BELARIUS,"O thou goddess,"
31034,Cymbeline,65,4.2.217,BELARIUS,"Thou divine Nature, how thyself thou blazon'st"
31035,Cymbeline,65,4.2.218,BELARIUS,In these two princely boys! They are as gentle
31036,Cymbeline,65,4.2.219,BELARIUS,"As zephyrs blowing below the violet,"
31037,Cymbeline,65,4.2.220,BELARIUS,"Not wagging his sweet head, and yet as rough,"
31038,Cymbeline,65,4.2.221,BELARIUS,"Their royal blood enchafed, as the rudest wind,"
31039,Cymbeline,65,4.2.222,BELARIUS,"That by the top doth take the mountain pine,"
31040,Cymbeline,65,4.2.223,BELARIUS,And make him stoop to the vale. 'Tis wonder
31041,Cymbeline,65,4.2.224,BELARIUS,That an invisible instinct should frame them
31042,Cymbeline,65,4.2.225,BELARIUS,"To royalty unlearn'd, honour untaught,"
31043,Cymbeline,65,4.2.226,BELARIUS,"Civility not seen from other, valour"
31044,Cymbeline,65,4.2.227,BELARIUS,"That wildly grows in them, but yields a crop"
31045,Cymbeline,65,4.2.228,BELARIUS,As if it had been sow'd. Yet still it's strange
31046,Cymbeline,65,4.2.229,BELARIUS,"What Cloten's being here to us portends,"
31047,Cymbeline,65,4.2.230,BELARIUS,Or what his death will bring us.
31048,Cymbeline,65,,BELARIUS,Re-enter GUIDERIUS
31049,Cymbeline,66,4.2.231,GUIDERIUS,Where's my brother?
31050,Cymbeline,66,4.2.232,GUIDERIUS,"I have sent Cloten's clotpoll down the stream,"
31051,Cymbeline,66,4.2.233,GUIDERIUS,In embassy to his mother: his body's hostage
31052,Cymbeline,66,4.2.234,GUIDERIUS,For his return.
31053,Cymbeline,66,,GUIDERIUS,Solemn music
31054,Cymbeline,67,4.2.235,BELARIUS,My ingenious instrument!
31055,Cymbeline,67,4.2.236,BELARIUS,"Hark, Polydore, it sounds! But what occasion"
31056,Cymbeline,67,4.2.237,BELARIUS,Hath Cadwal now to give it motion? Hark!
31057,Cymbeline,68,4.2.238,GUIDERIUS,Is he at home?
31058,Cymbeline,69,4.2.239,BELARIUS,He went hence even now.
31059,Cymbeline,70,4.2.240,GUIDERIUS,What does he mean? since death of my dear'st mother
31060,Cymbeline,70,4.2.241,GUIDERIUS,it did not speak before. All solemn things
31061,Cymbeline,70,4.2.242,GUIDERIUS,Should answer solemn accidents. The matter?
31062,Cymbeline,70,4.2.243,GUIDERIUS,Triumphs for nothing and lamenting toys
31063,Cymbeline,70,4.2.244,GUIDERIUS,Is jollity for apes and grief for boys.
31064,Cymbeline,70,4.2.245,GUIDERIUS,Is Cadwal mad?
31065,Cymbeline,71,4.2.246,BELARIUS,"Look, here he comes,"
31066,Cymbeline,71,4.2.247,BELARIUS,And brings the dire occasion in his arms
31067,Cymbeline,71,4.2.248,BELARIUS,Of what we blame him for.
31068,Cymbeline,71,,BELARIUS,"Re-enter ARVIRAGUS, with IMOGEN, as dead, bearing her in his arms"
31069,Cymbeline,72,4.2.249,ARVIRAGUS,The bird is dead
31070,Cymbeline,72,4.2.250,ARVIRAGUS,That we have made so much on. I had rather
31071,Cymbeline,72,4.2.251,ARVIRAGUS,"Have skipp'd from sixteen years of age to sixty,"
31072,Cymbeline,72,4.2.252,ARVIRAGUS,"To have turn'd my leaping-time into a crutch,"
31073,Cymbeline,72,4.2.253,ARVIRAGUS,Than have seen this.
31074,Cymbeline,73,4.2.254,GUIDERIUS,"O sweetest, fairest lily!"
31075,Cymbeline,73,4.2.255,GUIDERIUS,My brother wears thee not the one half so well
31076,Cymbeline,73,4.2.256,GUIDERIUS,As when thou grew'st thyself.
31077,Cymbeline,74,4.2.257,BELARIUS,O melancholy!
31078,Cymbeline,74,4.2.258,BELARIUS,Who ever yet could sound thy bottom? find
31079,Cymbeline,74,4.2.259,BELARIUS,"The ooze, to show what coast thy sluggish crare"
31080,Cymbeline,74,4.2.260,BELARIUS,Might easiliest harbour in? Thou blessed thing!
31081,Cymbeline,74,4.2.261,BELARIUS,"Jove knows what man thou mightst have made, but I,"
31082,Cymbeline,74,4.2.262,BELARIUS,"Thou diedst, a most rare boy, of melancholy."
31083,Cymbeline,74,4.2.263,BELARIUS,How found you him?
31084,Cymbeline,75,4.2.264,ARVIRAGUS,"Stark, as you see:"
31085,Cymbeline,75,4.2.265,ARVIRAGUS,"Thus smiling, as some fly hid tickled slumber,"
31086,Cymbeline,75,4.2.266,ARVIRAGUS,"Not as death's dart, being laugh'd at, his"
31087,Cymbeline,75,4.2.267,ARVIRAGUS,right cheek
31088,Cymbeline,75,4.2.268,ARVIRAGUS,Reposing on a cushion.
31089,Cymbeline,76,4.2.269,GUIDERIUS,Where?
31090,Cymbeline,77,4.2.270,ARVIRAGUS,"O' the floor,"
31091,Cymbeline,77,4.2.271,ARVIRAGUS,"His arms thus leagued: I thought he slept, and put"
31092,Cymbeline,77,4.2.272,ARVIRAGUS,"My clouted brogues from off my feet, whose rudeness"
31093,Cymbeline,77,4.2.273,ARVIRAGUS,Answer'd my steps too loud.
31094,Cymbeline,78,4.2.274,GUIDERIUS,"Why, he but sleeps:"
31095,Cymbeline,78,4.2.275,GUIDERIUS,"If he be gone, he'll make his grave a bed,"
31096,Cymbeline,78,4.2.276,GUIDERIUS,"With female fairies will his tomb be haunted,"
31097,Cymbeline,78,4.2.277,GUIDERIUS,And worms will not come to thee.
31098,Cymbeline,79,4.2.278,ARVIRAGUS,With fairest flowers
31099,Cymbeline,79,4.2.279,ARVIRAGUS,"Whilst summer lasts and I live here, Fidele,"
31100,Cymbeline,79,4.2.280,ARVIRAGUS,I'll sweeten thy sad grave: thou shalt not lack
31101,Cymbeline,79,4.2.281,ARVIRAGUS,"The flower that's like thy face, pale primrose, nor"
31102,Cymbeline,79,4.2.282,ARVIRAGUS,"The azured harebell, like thy veins, no, nor"
31103,Cymbeline,79,4.2.283,ARVIRAGUS,"The leaf of eglantine, whom not to slander,"
31104,Cymbeline,79,4.2.284,ARVIRAGUS,"Out-sweeten'd not thy breath: the ruddock would,"
31105,Cymbeline,79,4.2.285,ARVIRAGUS,"With charitable bill,--O bill, sore-shaming"
31106,Cymbeline,79,4.2.286,ARVIRAGUS,Those rich-left heirs that let their fathers lie
31107,Cymbeline,79,4.2.287,ARVIRAGUS,"Without a monument!--bring thee all this,"
31108,Cymbeline,79,4.2.288,ARVIRAGUS,"Yea, and furr'd moss besides, when flowers are none,"
31109,Cymbeline,79,4.2.289,ARVIRAGUS,To winter-ground thy corse.
31110,Cymbeline,80,4.2.290,GUIDERIUS,"Prithee, have done,"
31111,Cymbeline,80,4.2.291,GUIDERIUS,And do not play in wench-like words with that
31112,Cymbeline,80,4.2.292,GUIDERIUS,"Which is so serious. Let us bury him,"
31113,Cymbeline,80,4.2.293,GUIDERIUS,And not protract with admiration what
31114,Cymbeline,80,4.2.294,GUIDERIUS,Is now due debt. To the grave!
31115,Cymbeline,81,4.2.295,ARVIRAGUS,"Say, where shall's lay him?"
31116,Cymbeline,82,4.2.296,GUIDERIUS,"By good Euriphile, our mother."
31117,Cymbeline,83,4.2.297,ARVIRAGUS,Be't so:
31118,Cymbeline,83,4.2.298,ARVIRAGUS,"And let us, Polydore, though now our voices"
31119,Cymbeline,83,4.2.299,ARVIRAGUS,"Have got the mannish crack, sing him to the ground,"
31120,Cymbeline,83,4.2.300,ARVIRAGUS,"As once our mother, use like note and words,"
31121,Cymbeline,83,4.2.301,ARVIRAGUS,Save that Euriphile must be Fidele.
31122,Cymbeline,84,4.2.302,GUIDERIUS,"Cadwal,"
31123,Cymbeline,84,4.2.303,GUIDERIUS,"I cannot sing: I'll weep, and word it with thee,"
31124,Cymbeline,84,4.2.304,GUIDERIUS,For notes of sorrow out of tune are worse
31125,Cymbeline,84,4.2.305,GUIDERIUS,Than priests and fanes that lie.
31126,Cymbeline,85,4.2.306,ARVIRAGUS,"We'll speak it, then."
31127,Cymbeline,86,4.2.307,BELARIUS,"Great griefs, I see, medicine the less, for Cloten"
31128,Cymbeline,86,4.2.308,BELARIUS,"Is quite forgot. He was a queen's son, boys,"
31129,Cymbeline,86,4.2.309,BELARIUS,"And though he came our enemy, remember"
31130,Cymbeline,86,4.2.310,BELARIUS,He was paid for that: though mean and
31131,Cymbeline,86,4.2.311,BELARIUS,"mighty, rotting"
31132,Cymbeline,86,4.2.312,BELARIUS,"Together, have one dust, yet reverence,"
31133,Cymbeline,86,4.2.313,BELARIUS,"That angel of the world, doth make distinction"
31134,Cymbeline,86,4.2.314,BELARIUS,Of place 'tween high and low. Our foe was princely
31135,Cymbeline,86,4.2.315,BELARIUS,"And though you took his life, as being our foe,"
31136,Cymbeline,86,4.2.316,BELARIUS,Yet bury him as a prince.
31137,Cymbeline,87,4.2.317,GUIDERIUS,"Pray You, fetch him hither."
31138,Cymbeline,87,4.2.318,GUIDERIUS,"Thersites' body is as good as Ajax',"
31139,Cymbeline,87,4.2.319,GUIDERIUS,When neither are alive.
31140,Cymbeline,88,4.2.320,ARVIRAGUS,"If you'll go fetch him,"
31141,Cymbeline,88,4.2.321,ARVIRAGUS,"We'll say our song the whilst. Brother, begin."
31142,Cymbeline,88,,ARVIRAGUS,Exit BELARIUS
31143,Cymbeline,89,4.2.322,GUIDERIUS,"Nay, Cadwal, we must lay his head to the east,"
31144,Cymbeline,89,4.2.323,GUIDERIUS,My father hath a reason for't.
31145,Cymbeline,90,4.2.324,ARVIRAGUS,'Tis true.
31146,Cymbeline,91,4.2.325,GUIDERIUS,"Come on then, and remove him."
31147,Cymbeline,92,4.2.326,ARVIRAGUS,So. Begin.
31148,Cymbeline,92,,ARVIRAGUS,SONG
31149,Cymbeline,93,4.2.327,GUIDERIUS,"Fear no more the heat o' the sun,"
31150,Cymbeline,93,4.2.328,GUIDERIUS,"Nor the furious winter's rages,"
31151,Cymbeline,93,4.2.329,GUIDERIUS,"Thou thy worldly task hast done,"
31152,Cymbeline,93,4.2.330,GUIDERIUS,"Home art gone, and ta'en thy wages:"
31153,Cymbeline,93,4.2.331,GUIDERIUS,"Golden lads and girls all must,"
31154,Cymbeline,93,4.2.332,GUIDERIUS,"As chimney-sweepers, come to dust."
31155,Cymbeline,94,4.2.333,ARVIRAGUS,"Fear no more the frown o' the great,"
31156,Cymbeline,94,4.2.334,ARVIRAGUS,"Thou art past the tyrant's stroke,"
31157,Cymbeline,94,4.2.335,ARVIRAGUS,"Care no more to clothe and eat,"
31158,Cymbeline,94,4.2.336,ARVIRAGUS,To thee the reed is as the oak:
31159,Cymbeline,94,4.2.337,ARVIRAGUS,"The sceptre, learning, physic, must"
31160,Cymbeline,94,4.2.338,ARVIRAGUS,"All follow this, and come to dust."
31161,Cymbeline,95,4.2.339,GUIDERIUS,"Fear no more the lightning flash,"
31162,Cymbeline,96,4.2.340,ARVIRAGUS,"Nor the all-dreaded thunder-stone,"
31163,Cymbeline,97,4.2.341,GUIDERIUS,"Fear not slander, censure rash,"
31164,Cymbeline,98,4.2.342,ARVIRAGUS,Thou hast finish'd joy and moan:
31165,Cymbeline,100,4.2.343,ARVIRAGUS,"All lovers young, all lovers must"
31166,Cymbeline,100,4.2.344,ARVIRAGUS,"Consign to thee, and come to dust."
31167,Cymbeline,101,4.2.345,GUIDERIUS,No exorciser harm thee!
31168,Cymbeline,102,4.2.346,ARVIRAGUS,Nor no witchcraft charm thee!
31169,Cymbeline,103,4.2.347,GUIDERIUS,Ghost unlaid forbear thee!
31170,Cymbeline,104,4.2.348,ARVIRAGUS,Nothing ill come near thee!
31171,Cymbeline,106,4.2.349,ARVIRAGUS,"Quiet consummation have,"
31172,Cymbeline,106,4.2.350,ARVIRAGUS,And renowned be thy grave!
31173,Cymbeline,106,,ARVIRAGUS,"Re-enter BELARIUS, with the body of CLOTEN"
31174,Cymbeline,107,4.2.351,GUIDERIUS,"We have done our obsequies: come, lay him down."
31175,Cymbeline,108,4.2.352,BELARIUS,"Here's a few flowers, but 'bout midnight, more:"
31176,Cymbeline,108,4.2.353,BELARIUS,The herbs that have on them cold dew o' the night
31177,Cymbeline,108,4.2.354,BELARIUS,Are strewings fitt'st for graves. Upon their faces.
31178,Cymbeline,108,4.2.355,BELARIUS,"You were as flowers, now wither'd: even so"
31179,Cymbeline,108,4.2.356,BELARIUS,"These herblets shall, which we upon you strew."
31180,Cymbeline,108,4.2.357,BELARIUS,"Come on, away: apart upon our knees."
31181,Cymbeline,108,4.2.358,BELARIUS,The ground that gave them first has them again:
31182,Cymbeline,108,4.2.359,BELARIUS,"Their pleasures here are past, so is their pain."
31183,Cymbeline,108,,BELARIUS,"Exeunt BELARIUS, GUIDERIUS, and ARVIRAGUS"
31184,Cymbeline,109,4.2.360,IMOGEN,"[Awaking]  Yes, sir, to Milford-Haven, which is"

31192,Cymbeline,109,4.2.367,IMOGEN,"This bloody man, the care on't. I hope I dream,"
31193,Cymbeline,109,4.2.368,IMOGEN,"For so I thought I was a cave-keeper,"
31194,Cymbeline,109,4.2.369,IMOGEN,"And cook to honest creatures: but 'tis not so,"
31195,Cymbeline,109,4.2.370,IMOGEN,"'Twas but a bolt of nothing, shot at nothing,"
31196,Cymbeline,109,4.2.371,IMOGEN,Which the brain makes of fumes: our very eyes

31218,Cymbeline,109,4.2.393,IMOGEN,"Pisanio might have kill'd thee at the heart,"
31219,Cymbeline,109,4.2.394,IMOGEN,And left this head on. How should this be? Pisanio?

31236,Cymbeline,112,4.2.409,Captain,The senate hath stirr'd up the confiners
31237,Cymbeline,112,4.2.410,Captain,"And gentlemen of Italy, most willing spirits,"

31243,Cymbeline,115,4.2.416,CAIUS LUCIUS,This forwardness

31246,Cymbeline,115,4.2.419,CAIUS LUCIUS,What have you dream'd of late of this war's purpose?

31255,Cymbeline,117,4.2.428,CAIUS LUCIUS,"And never false. Soft, ho! what trunk is here"
31256,Cymbeline,117,4.2.429,CAIUS LUCIUS,Without his top? The ruin speaks that sometime
31257,Cymbeline,117,4.2.430,CAIUS LUCIUS,It was a worthy building. How! a page!
31258,Cymbeline,117,4.2.431,CAIUS LUCIUS,"Or dead, or sleeping on him? But dead rather,"
31259,Cymbeline,117,4.2.432,CAIUS LUCIUS,For nature doth abhor to make his bed
31260,Cymbeline,117,4.2.433,CAIUS LUCIUS,"With the defunct, or sleep upon the dead."
31261,Cymbeline,117,4.2.434,CAIUS LUCIUS,Let's see the boy's face.

31267,Cymbeline,119,4.2.440,CAIUS LUCIUS,"That, otherwise than noble nature did,"
31268,Cymbeline,119,4.2.441,CAIUS LUCIUS,Hath alter'd that good picture? What's thy interest
31269,Cymbeline,119,4.2.442,CAIUS LUCIUS,In this sad wreck? How came it? Who is it?
31270,Cymbeline,119,4.2.443,CAIUS LUCIUS,What art thou?
31271,Cymbeline,120,4.2.444,IMOGEN,"I am nothing: or if not,"
31272,Cymbeline,120,4.2.445,IMOGEN,"Nothing to be were better. This was my master,"
31273,Cymbeline,120,4.2.446,IMOGEN,"A very valiant Briton and a good,"
31274,Cymbeline,120,4.2.447,IMOGEN,That here by mountaineers lies slain. Alas!
31275,Cymbeline,120,4.2.448,IMOGEN,There is no more such masters: I may wander

31280,Cymbeline,121,4.2.453,CAIUS LUCIUS,Thou movest no less with thy complaining than
31281,Cymbeline,121,4.2.454,CAIUS LUCIUS,"Thy master in bleeding: say his name, good friend."
31282,Cymbeline,122,4.2.455,IMOGEN,Richard du Champ.

31286,Cymbeline,122,4.2.458,IMOGEN,"They'll pardon it.--Say you, sir?"
31287,Cymbeline,123,4.2.459,CAIUS LUCIUS,Thy name?
31288,Cymbeline,124,4.2.460,IMOGEN,"Fidele, sir."
31289,Cymbeline,125,4.2.461,CAIUS LUCIUS,Thou dost approve thyself the very same:

31293,Cymbeline,125,4.2.465,CAIUS LUCIUS,"No less beloved. The Roman emperor's letters,"
31294,Cymbeline,125,4.2.466,CAIUS LUCIUS,"Sent by a consul to me, should not sooner"
31295,Cymbeline,125,4.2.467,CAIUS LUCIUS,Than thine own worth prefer thee: go with me.
31296,Cymbeline,126,4.2.468,IMOGEN,"I'll follow, sir. But first, an't please the gods,"
31297,Cymbeline,126,4.2.469,IMOGEN,"I'll hide my master from the flies, as deep"
31298,Cymbeline,126,4.2.470,IMOGEN,"As these poor pickaxes can dig, and when"

31300,Cymbeline,126,4.2.472,IMOGEN,"And on it said a century of prayers,"
31301,Cymbeline,126,4.2.473,IMOGEN,"Such as I can, twice o'er, I'll weep and sigh,"
31302,Cymbeline,126,4.2.474,IMOGEN,"And leaving so his service, follow you,"
31303,Cymbeline,126,4.2.475,IMOGEN,So please you entertain me.

31305,Cymbeline,127,4.2.477,CAIUS LUCIUS,And rather father thee than master thee.
31306,Cymbeline,127,4.2.478,CAIUS LUCIUS,"My friends,"
31307,Cymbeline,127,4.2.479,CAIUS LUCIUS,The boy hath taught us manly duties: let us
31308,Cymbeline,127,4.2.480,CAIUS LUCIUS,"Find out the prettiest daisied plot we can,"
31309,Cymbeline,127,4.2.481,CAIUS LUCIUS,And make him with our pikes and partisans
31310,Cymbeline,127,4.2.482,CAIUS LUCIUS,"A grave: come, arm him. Boy, he is preferr'd"
31311,Cymbeline,127,4.2.483,CAIUS LUCIUS,"By thee to us, and he shall be interr'd"
31312,Cymbeline,127,4.2.484,CAIUS LUCIUS,"As soldiers can. Be cheerful, wipe thine eyes"

31319,Cymbeline,1,4.3.2,CYMBELINE,"A fever with the absence of her son,"
31320,Cymbeline,1,4.3.3,CYMBELINE,"A madness, of which her life's in danger. Heavens,"
31321,Cymbeline,1,4.3.4,CYMBELINE,"How deeply you at once do touch me! Imogen,"
31322,Cymbeline,1,4.3.5,CYMBELINE,"The great part of my comfort, gone, my queen"
31323,Cymbeline,1,4.3.6,CYMBELINE,"Upon a desperate bed, and in a time"
31324,Cymbeline,1,4.3.7,CYMBELINE,"When fearful wars point at me, her son gone,"
31325,Cymbeline,1,4.3.8,CYMBELINE,"So needful for this present: it strikes me, past"
31326,Cymbeline,1,4.3.9,CYMBELINE,"The hope of comfort. But for thee, fellow,"
31327,Cymbeline,1,4.3.10,CYMBELINE,Who needs must know of her departure and
31328,Cymbeline,1,4.3.11,CYMBELINE,"Dost seem so ignorant, we'll enforce it from thee"
31329,Cymbeline,1,4.3.12,CYMBELINE,By a sharp torture.
31330,Cymbeline,2,4.3.13,PISANIO,"Sir, my life is yours,"

31332,Cymbeline,2,4.3.15,PISANIO,"I nothing know where she remains, why gone,"
31333,Cymbeline,2,4.3.16,PISANIO,"Nor when she purposes return. Beseech your highness,"
31334,Cymbeline,2,4.3.17,PISANIO,Hold me your loyal servant.
31335,Cymbeline,3,4.3.18,First Lord,"Good my liege,"
31336,Cymbeline,3,4.3.19,First Lord,The day that she was missing he was here:

31339,Cymbeline,3,4.3.22,First Lord,"There wants no diligence in seeking him,"
31340,Cymbeline,3,4.3.23,First Lord,"And will, no doubt, be found."
31341,Cymbeline,4,4.3.24,CYMBELINE,The time is troublesome.

31343,Cymbeline,4,4.3.25,CYMBELINE,"We'll slip you for a season, but our jealousy"
31344,Cymbeline,4,4.3.26,CYMBELINE,Does yet depend.
31345,Cymbeline,5,4.3.27,First Lord,"So please your majesty,"
31346,Cymbeline,5,4.3.28,First Lord,"The Roman legions, all from Gallia drawn,"

31351,Cymbeline,7,4.3.33,First Lord,"Good my liege,"
31352,Cymbeline,7,4.3.34,First Lord,Your preparation can affront no less
31353,Cymbeline,7,4.3.35,First Lord,"Than what you hear of: come more, for more"
31354,Cymbeline,7,4.3.36,First Lord,you're ready:
31355,Cymbeline,7,4.3.37,First Lord,The want is but to put those powers in motion
31356,Cymbeline,7,4.3.38,First Lord,That long to move.
31357,Cymbeline,8,4.3.39,CYMBELINE,"I thank you. Let's withdraw,"

31359,Cymbeline,8,4.3.41,CYMBELINE,"What can from Italy annoy us, but"
31360,Cymbeline,8,4.3.42,CYMBELINE,We grieve at chances here. Away!

31362,Cymbeline,9,4.3.43,PISANIO,I heard no letter from my master since
31363,Cymbeline,9,4.3.44,PISANIO,I wrote him Imogen was slain: 'tis strange:
31364,Cymbeline,9,4.3.45,PISANIO,Nor hear I from my mistress who did promise
31365,Cymbeline,9,4.3.46,PISANIO,To yield me often tidings: neither know I
31366,Cymbeline,9,4.3.47,PISANIO,"What is betid to Cloten, but remain"
31367,Cymbeline,9,4.3.48,PISANIO,Perplex'd in all. The heavens still must work.
31368,Cymbeline,9,4.3.49,PISANIO,"Wherein I am false I am honest, not true, to be true."
31369,Cymbeline,9,4.3.50,PISANIO,"These present wars shall find I love my country,"
31370,Cymbeline,9,4.3.51,PISANIO,"Even to the note o' the king, or I'll fall in them."
31371,Cymbeline,9,4.3.52,PISANIO,"All other doubts, by time let them be clear'd:"
31372,Cymbeline,9,4.3.53,PISANIO,Fortune brings in some boats that are not steer'd.

31375,Cymbeline,9,,PISANIO,"Enter BELARIUS, GUIDERIUS, and ARVIRAGUS."
31376,Cymbeline,1,4.4.1,GUIDERIUS,The noise is round about us.
31377,Cymbeline,2,4.4.2,BELARIUS,Let us from it.
31378,Cymbeline,3,4.4.3,ARVIRAGUS,"What pleasure, sir, find we in life, to lock it"
31379,Cymbeline,3,4.4.4,ARVIRAGUS,From action and adventure?
31380,Cymbeline,4,4.4.5,GUIDERIUS,"Nay, what hope"
31381,Cymbeline,4,4.4.6,GUIDERIUS,"Have we in hiding us? This way, the Romans"
31382,Cymbeline,4,4.4.7,GUIDERIUS,"Must or for Britons slay us, or receive us"
31383,Cymbeline,4,4.4.8,GUIDERIUS,For barbarous and unnatural revolts
31384,Cymbeline,4,4.4.9,GUIDERIUS,"During their use, and slay us after."
31385,Cymbeline,5,4.4.10,BELARIUS,"Sons,"

31387,Cymbeline,5,4.4.12,BELARIUS,To the king's party there's no going: newness
31388,Cymbeline,5,4.4.13,BELARIUS,"Of Cloten's death--we being not known, not muster'd"
31389,Cymbeline,5,4.4.14,BELARIUS,Among the bands--may drive us to a render
31390,Cymbeline,5,4.4.15,BELARIUS,"Where we have lived, and so extort from's that"
31391,Cymbeline,5,4.4.16,BELARIUS,"Which we have done, whose answer would be death"
31392,Cymbeline,5,4.4.17,BELARIUS,Drawn on with torture.
31393,Cymbeline,6,4.4.18,GUIDERIUS,"This is, sir, a doubt"
31394,Cymbeline,6,4.4.19,GUIDERIUS,"In such a time nothing becoming you,"
31395,Cymbeline,6,4.4.20,GUIDERIUS,Nor satisfying us.
31396,Cymbeline,7,4.4.21,ARVIRAGUS,It is not likely
31397,Cymbeline,7,4.4.22,ARVIRAGUS,"That when they hear the Roman horses neigh,"
31398,Cymbeline,7,4.4.23,ARVIRAGUS,"Behold their quarter'd fires, have both their eyes"
31399,Cymbeline,7,4.4.24,ARVIRAGUS,"And ears so cloy'd importantly as now,"
31400,Cymbeline,7,4.4.25,ARVIRAGUS,"That they will waste their time upon our note,"
31401,Cymbeline,7,4.4.26,ARVIRAGUS,To know from whence we are.
31402,Cymbeline,8,4.4.27,BELARIUS,"O, I am known"
31403,Cymbeline,8,4.4.28,BELARIUS,"Of many in the army: many years,"
31404,Cymbeline,8,4.4.29,BELARIUS,"Though Cloten then but young, you see, not wore him"
31405,Cymbeline,8,4.4.30,BELARIUS,"From my remembrance. And, besides, the king"
31406,Cymbeline,8,4.4.31,BELARIUS,"Hath not deserved my service nor your loves,"
31407,Cymbeline,8,4.4.32,BELARIUS,"Who find in my exile the want of breeding,"
31408,Cymbeline,8,4.4.33,BELARIUS,"The certainty of this hard life, aye hopeless"
31409,Cymbeline,8,4.4.34,BELARIUS,"To have the courtesy your cradle promised,"
31410,Cymbeline,8,4.4.35,BELARIUS,But to be still hot summer's tamings and
31411,Cymbeline,8,4.4.36,BELARIUS,The shrinking slaves of winter.
31412,Cymbeline,9,4.4.37,GUIDERIUS,Than be so
31413,Cymbeline,9,4.4.38,GUIDERIUS,"Better to cease to be. Pray, sir, to the army:"
31414,Cymbeline,9,4.4.39,GUIDERIUS,"I and my brother are not known, yourself"
31415,Cymbeline,9,4.4.40,GUIDERIUS,"So out of thought, and thereto so o'ergrown,"
31416,Cymbeline,9,4.4.41,GUIDERIUS,Cannot be question'd.
31417,Cymbeline,10,4.4.42,ARVIRAGUS,"By this sun that shines,"
31418,Cymbeline,10,4.4.43,ARVIRAGUS,I'll thither: what thing is it that I never
31419,Cymbeline,10,4.4.44,ARVIRAGUS,"Did see man die! scarce ever look'd on blood,"
31420,Cymbeline,10,4.4.45,ARVIRAGUS,"But that of coward hares, hot goats, and venison!"
31421,Cymbeline,10,4.4.46,ARVIRAGUS,"Never bestrid a horse, save one that had"
31422,Cymbeline,10,4.4.47,ARVIRAGUS,"A rider like myself, who ne'er wore rowel"
31423,Cymbeline,10,4.4.48,ARVIRAGUS,Nor iron on his heel! I am ashamed
31424,Cymbeline,10,4.4.49,ARVIRAGUS,"To look upon the holy sun, to have"
31425,Cymbeline,10,4.4.50,ARVIRAGUS,"The benefit of his blest beams, remaining"
31426,Cymbeline,10,4.4.51,ARVIRAGUS,So long a poor unknown.
31427,Cymbeline,11,4.4.52,GUIDERIUS,"By heavens, I'll go:"
31428,Cymbeline,11,4.4.53,GUIDERIUS,"If you will bless me, sir, and give me leave,"
31429,Cymbeline,11,4.4.54,GUIDERIUS,"I'll take the better care, but if you will not,"
31430,Cymbeline,11,4.4.55,GUIDERIUS,The hazard therefore due fall on me by
31431,Cymbeline,11,4.4.56,GUIDERIUS,The hands of Romans!
31432,Cymbeline,12,4.4.57,ARVIRAGUS,"So say I	amen."
31433,Cymbeline,13,4.4.58,BELARIUS,"No reason I, since of your lives you set"
31434,Cymbeline,13,4.4.59,BELARIUS,"So slight a valuation, should reserve"
31435,Cymbeline,13,4.4.60,BELARIUS,"My crack'd one to more care. Have with you, boys!"
31436,Cymbeline,13,4.4.61,BELARIUS,"If in your country wars you chance to die,"
31437,Cymbeline,13,4.4.62,BELARIUS,"That is my bed too, lads, an there I'll lie:"
31438,Cymbeline,13,4.4.63,BELARIUS,"Lead, lead."
31439,Cymbeline,13,,BELARIUS,Aside
31440,Cymbeline,13,4.4.64,BELARIUS,"The time seems long, their blood"
31441,Cymbeline,13,4.4.65,BELARIUS,"thinks scorn,"
31442,Cymbeline,13,4.4.66,BELARIUS,Till it fly out and show them princes born.

31444,Cymbeline,13,,BELARIUS,ACT V
31445,Cymbeline,13,,BELARIUS,SCENE I. Britain. The Roman camp.
31446,Cymbeline,13,,BELARIUS,"Enter POSTHUMUS, with a bloody handkerchief"
31447,Cymbeline,1,5.1.1,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Yea, bloody cloth, I'll keep thee, for I wish'd"
31448,Cymbeline,1,5.1.2,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Thou shouldst be colour'd thus. You married ones,"
31449,Cymbeline,1,5.1.3,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"If each of you should take this course, how many"
31450,Cymbeline,1,5.1.4,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,Must murder wives much better than themselves
31451,Cymbeline,1,5.1.5,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,For wrying but a little! O Pisanio!
31452,Cymbeline,1,5.1.6,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,Every good servant does not all commands:
31453,Cymbeline,1,5.1.7,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,No bond but to do just ones. Gods! if you
31454,Cymbeline,1,5.1.8,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Should have ta'en vengeance on my faults, I never"
31455,Cymbeline,1,5.1.9,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,Had lived to put on this: so had you saved
31456,Cymbeline,1,5.1.10,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"The noble Imogen to repent, and struck"
31457,Cymbeline,1,5.1.11,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Me, wretch more worth your vengeance. But, alack,"
31458,Cymbeline,1,5.1.12,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"You snatch some hence for little faults, that's love,"
31459,Cymbeline,1,5.1.13,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,To have them fall no more: you some permit
31460,Cymbeline,1,5.1.14,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"To second ills with ills, each elder worse,"
31461,Cymbeline,1,5.1.15,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"And make them dread it, to the doers' thrift."
31462,Cymbeline,1,5.1.16,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"But Imogen is your own: do your best wills,"
31463,Cymbeline,1,5.1.17,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,And make me blest to obey! I am brought hither
31464,Cymbeline,1,5.1.18,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Among the Italian gentry, and to fight"
31465,Cymbeline,1,5.1.19,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,Against my lady's kingdom: 'tis enough
31466,Cymbeline,1,5.1.20,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"That, Britain, I have kill'd thy mistress, peace!"
31467,Cymbeline,1,5.1.21,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"I'll give no wound to thee. Therefore, good heavens,"
31468,Cymbeline,1,5.1.22,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,Hear patiently my purpose: I'll disrobe me
31469,Cymbeline,1,5.1.23,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,Of these Italian weeds and suit myself
31470,Cymbeline,1,5.1.24,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,As does a Briton peasant: so I'll fight
31471,Cymbeline,1,5.1.25,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Against the part I come with, so I'll die"
31472,Cymbeline,1,5.1.26,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"For thee, O Imogen, even for whom my life"
31473,Cymbeline,1,5.1.27,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Is every breath a death, and thus, unknown,"
31474,Cymbeline,1,5.1.28,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Pitied nor hated, to the face of peril"
31475,Cymbeline,1,5.1.29,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,Myself I'll dedicate. Let me make men know
31476,Cymbeline,1,5.1.30,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,More valour in me than my habits show.
31477,Cymbeline,1,5.1.31,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Gods, put the strength o' the Leonati in me!"
31478,Cymbeline,1,5.1.32,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"To shame the guise o' the world, I will begin"
31479,Cymbeline,1,5.1.33,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"The fashion, less without and more within."
31480,Cymbeline,1,,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,Exit
31481,Cymbeline,1,,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,SCENE II. Field of battle between the British and Roman camps.
31482,Cymbeline,1,,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Enter, from one side, LUCIUS, IACHIMO, and  the Roman Army: from the other side, the  British Army, POSTHUMUS LEONATUS following,  like a poor soldier. They march over and go  out. Then enter again, in skirmish, IACHIMO  and POSTHUMUS LEONATUS he vanquisheth and disarmeth IACHIMO, and then leaves him"
31483,Cymbeline,1,5.2.1,IACHIMO,The heaviness and guilt within my bosom
31484,Cymbeline,1,5.2.2,IACHIMO,"Takes off my manhood: I have belied a lady,"
31485,Cymbeline,1,5.2.3,IACHIMO,"The princess of this country, and the air on't"
31486,Cymbeline,1,5.2.4,IACHIMO,"Revengingly enfeebles me, or could this carl,"
31487,Cymbeline,1,5.2.5,IACHIMO,"A very drudge of nature's, have subdued me"
31488,Cymbeline,1,5.2.6,IACHIMO,"In my profession? Knighthoods and honours, borne"
31489,Cymbeline,1,5.2.7,IACHIMO,"As I wear mine, are titles but of scorn."
31490,Cymbeline,1,5.2.8,IACHIMO,"If that thy gentry, Britain, go before"
31491,Cymbeline,1,5.2.9,IACHIMO,"This lout as he exceeds our lords, the odds"
31492,Cymbeline,1,5.2.10,IACHIMO,Is that we scarce are men and you are gods.
31493,Cymbeline,1,,IACHIMO,Exit
31494,Cymbeline,1,,IACHIMO,"The battle continues, the Britons fly, CYMBELINE is  taken: then enter, to his rescue, BELARIUS, GUIDERIUS, and ARVIRAGUS"
31495,Cymbeline,2,5.2.11,BELARIUS,"Stand, stand! We have the advantage of the ground,"
31496,Cymbeline,2,5.2.12,BELARIUS,The lane is guarded: nothing routs us but
31497,Cymbeline,2,5.2.13,BELARIUS,The villany of our fears.
31498,Cymbeline,4,5.2.14,ARVIRAGUS,"Stand, stand, and fight!"
31499,Cymbeline,4,5.2.14,ARVIRAGUS,"Re-enter POSTHUMUS LEONATUS, and seconds the  Britons: they rescue CYMBELINE, and exeunt. Then re-enter LUCIUS, and IACHIMO, with IMOGEN"
31500,Cymbeline,5,5.2.15,CAIUS LUCIUS,"Away, boy, from the troops, and save thyself,"
31501,Cymbeline,5,5.2.16,CAIUS LUCIUS,"For friends kill friends, and the disorder's such"
31502,Cymbeline,5,5.2.17,CAIUS LUCIUS,As war were hoodwink'd.
31503,Cymbeline,6,5.2.18,IACHIMO,'Tis their fresh supplies.
31504,Cymbeline,7,5.2.19,CAIUS LUCIUS,It is a day turn'd strangely: or betimes
31505,Cymbeline,7,5.2.20,CAIUS LUCIUS,"Let's reinforce, or fly."
31506,Cymbeline,7,,CAIUS LUCIUS,Exeunt
31507,Cymbeline,7,,CAIUS LUCIUS,SCENE III. Another part of the field.
31508,Cymbeline,7,,CAIUS LUCIUS,Enter POSTHUMUS LEONATUS and a British Lord
31509,Cymbeline,1,5.3.1,Lord,Camest thou from where they made the stand?
31510,Cymbeline,2,5.3.2,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,I did.
31511,Cymbeline,2,5.3.3,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Though you, it seems, come from the fliers."
31512,Cymbeline,3,5.3.4,Lord,I did.
31513,Cymbeline,4,5.3.5,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"No blame be to you, sir, for all was lost,"
31514,Cymbeline,4,5.3.6,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,But that the heavens fought: the king himself
31515,Cymbeline,4,5.3.7,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Of his wings destitute, the army broken,"
31516,Cymbeline,4,5.3.8,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"And but the backs of Britons seen, all flying"
31517,Cymbeline,4,5.3.9,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Through a straight lane, the enemy full-hearted,"
31518,Cymbeline,4,5.3.10,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Lolling the tongue with slaughtering, having work"
31519,Cymbeline,4,5.3.11,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"More plentiful than tools to do't, struck down"
31520,Cymbeline,4,5.3.12,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Some mortally, some slightly touch'd, some falling"
31521,Cymbeline,4,5.3.13,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Merely through fear, that the straight pass was damm'd"
31522,Cymbeline,4,5.3.14,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"With dead men hurt behind, and cowards living"
31523,Cymbeline,4,5.3.15,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,To die with lengthen'd shame.
31524,Cymbeline,5,5.3.16,Lord,Where was this lane?
31525,Cymbeline,6,5.3.17,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Close by the battle, ditch'd, and wall'd with turf,"
31526,Cymbeline,6,5.3.18,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Which gave advantage to an ancient soldier,"
31527,Cymbeline,6,5.3.19,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"An honest one, I warrant, who deserved"
31528,Cymbeline,6,5.3.20,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"So long a breeding as his white beard came to,"
31529,Cymbeline,6,5.3.21,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"In doing this for's country: athwart the lane,"
31530,Cymbeline,6,5.3.22,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"He, with two striplings-lads more like to run"
31531,Cymbeline,6,5.3.23,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,The country base than to commit such slaughter
31532,Cymbeline,6,5.3.24,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"With faces fit for masks, or rather fairer"
31533,Cymbeline,6,5.3.25,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Than those for preservation cased, or shame--"
31534,Cymbeline,6,5.3.26,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Made good the passage, cried to those that fled,"
31535,Cymbeline,6,5.3.27,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"'Our Britain s harts die flying, not our men:"
31536,Cymbeline,6,5.3.28,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"To darkness fleet souls that fly backwards. Stand,"
31537,Cymbeline,6,5.3.29,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,Or we are Romans and will give you that
31538,Cymbeline,6,5.3.30,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Like beasts which you shun beastly, and may save,"
31539,Cymbeline,6,5.3.31,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"But to look back in frown: stand, stand.'"
31540,Cymbeline,6,5.3.32,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"These three,"
31541,Cymbeline,6,5.3.33,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Three thousand confident, in act as many--"
31542,Cymbeline,6,5.3.34,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,For three performers are the file when all
31543,Cymbeline,6,5.3.35,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"The rest do nothing--with this word 'Stand, stand,'"
31544,Cymbeline,6,5.3.36,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Accommodated by the place, more charming"
31545,Cymbeline,6,5.3.37,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"With their own nobleness, which could have turn'd"
31546,Cymbeline,6,5.3.38,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"A distaff to a lance, gilded pale looks,"
31547,Cymbeline,6,5.3.39,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Part shame, part spirit renew'd, that some,"
31548,Cymbeline,6,5.3.40,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,turn'd coward
31549,Cymbeline,6,5.3.41,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"But by example--O, a sin in war,"
31550,Cymbeline,6,5.3.42,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,Damn'd in the first beginners!--gan to look
31551,Cymbeline,6,5.3.43,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"The way that they did, and to grin like lions"
31552,Cymbeline,6,5.3.44,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,Upon the pikes o' the hunters. Then began
31553,Cymbeline,6,5.3.45,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"A stop i' the chaser, a retire, anon"
31554,Cymbeline,6,5.3.46,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"A rout, confusion thick, forthwith they fly"
31555,Cymbeline,6,5.3.47,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Chickens, the way which they stoop'd eagles, slaves,"
31556,Cymbeline,6,5.3.48,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"The strides they victors made: and now our cowards,"
31557,Cymbeline,6,5.3.49,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Like fragments in hard voyages, became"
31558,Cymbeline,6,5.3.50,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,The life o' the need: having found the backdoor open
31559,Cymbeline,6,5.3.51,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Of the unguarded hearts, heavens, how they wound!"
31560,Cymbeline,6,5.3.52,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Some slain before, some dying, some their friends"
31561,Cymbeline,6,5.3.53,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"O'er borne i' the former wave: ten, chased by one,"
31562,Cymbeline,6,5.3.54,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,Are now each one the slaughter-man of twenty:
31563,Cymbeline,6,5.3.55,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,Those that would die or ere resist are grown
31564,Cymbeline,6,5.3.56,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,The mortal bugs o' the field.
31565,Cymbeline,7,5.3.57,Lord,This was strange chance
31566,Cymbeline,7,5.3.58,Lord,"A narrow lane, an old man, and two boys."
31567,Cymbeline,8,5.3.59,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Nay, do not wonder at it: you are made"
31568,Cymbeline,8,5.3.60,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,Rather to wonder at the things you hear
31569,Cymbeline,8,5.3.61,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Than to work any. Will you rhyme upon't,"
31570,Cymbeline,8,5.3.62,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,And vent it for a mockery? Here is one:
31571,Cymbeline,8,5.3.63,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"'Two boys, an old man twice a boy, a lane,"
31572,Cymbeline,8,5.3.64,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Preserved the Britons, was the Romans' bane.'"
31573,Cymbeline,9,5.3.65,Lord,"Nay, be not angry, sir."
31574,Cymbeline,10,5.3.66,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"'Lack, to what end?"
31575,Cymbeline,10,5.3.67,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Who dares not stand his foe, I'll be his friend,"
31576,Cymbeline,10,5.3.68,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"For if he'll do as he is made to do,"
31577,Cymbeline,10,5.3.69,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,I know he'll quickly fly my friendship too.
31578,Cymbeline,10,5.3.70,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,You have put me into rhyme.
31579,Cymbeline,11,5.3.71,Lord,"Farewell, you're angry."
31580,Cymbeline,12,5.3.72,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,Still going?
31581,Cymbeline,12,,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,Exit Lord
31582,Cymbeline,12,5.3.73,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"This is a lord! O noble misery,"
31583,Cymbeline,12,5.3.74,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"To be i' the field, and ask 'what news?' of me!"
31584,Cymbeline,12,5.3.75,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,To-day how many would have given their honours
31585,Cymbeline,12,5.3.76,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"To have saved their carcasses! took heel to do't,"
31586,Cymbeline,12,5.3.77,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"And yet died too! I, in mine own woe charm'd,"
31587,Cymbeline,12,5.3.78,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Could not find death where I did hear him groan,"
31588,Cymbeline,12,5.3.79,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Nor feel him where he struck: being an ugly monster,"
31589,Cymbeline,12,5.3.80,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"'Tis strange he hides him in fresh cups, soft beds,"
31590,Cymbeline,12,5.3.81,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Sweet words, or hath more ministers than we"
31591,Cymbeline,12,5.3.82,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"That draw his knives i' the war. Well, I will find him"
31592,Cymbeline,12,5.3.83,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"For being now a favourer to the Briton,"
31593,Cymbeline,12,5.3.84,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"No more a Briton, I have resumed again"
31594,Cymbeline,12,5.3.85,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"The part I came in: fight I will no more,"
31595,Cymbeline,12,5.3.86,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,But yield me to the veriest hind that shall
31596,Cymbeline,12,5.3.87,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,Once touch my shoulder. Great the slaughter is
31597,Cymbeline,12,5.3.88,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Here made by the Roman, great the answer be"
31598,Cymbeline,12,5.3.89,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Britons must take. For me, my ransom's death,"
31599,Cymbeline,12,5.3.90,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"On either side I come to spend my breath,"
31600,Cymbeline,12,5.3.91,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Which neither here I'll keep nor bear again,"
31601,Cymbeline,12,5.3.92,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,But end it by some means for Imogen.
31602,Cymbeline,12,,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,Enter two British Captains and Soldiers
31603,Cymbeline,13,5.3.93,First Captain,Great Jupiter be praised! Lucius is taken.
31604,Cymbeline,13,5.3.94,First Captain,'Tis thought the old man and his sons were angels.
31605,Cymbeline,14,5.3.95,Second Captain,"There was a fourth man, in a silly habit,"
31606,Cymbeline,14,5.3.96,Second Captain,That gave the affront with them.
31607,Cymbeline,15,5.3.97,First Captain,So 'tis reported:
31608,Cymbeline,15,5.3.98,First Captain,But none of 'em can be found. Stand! who's there?
31609,Cymbeline,16,5.3.99,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"A Roman,"
31610,Cymbeline,16,5.3.100,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Who had not now been drooping here, if seconds"
31611,Cymbeline,16,5.3.101,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,Had answer'd him.
31612,Cymbeline,17,5.3.102,Second Captain,"Lay hands on him, a dog!"

31840,Cymbeline,1,5.5.2,CYMBELINE,Preservers of my throne. Woe is my heart

31845,Cymbeline,1,5.5.7,CYMBELINE,Our grace can make him so.
31846,Cymbeline,2,5.5.8,BELARIUS,I never saw
31847,Cymbeline,2,5.5.9,BELARIUS,"Such noble fury in so poor a thing,"
31848,Cymbeline,2,5.5.10,BELARIUS,Such precious deeds in one that promises nought
31849,Cymbeline,2,5.5.11,BELARIUS,But beggary and poor looks.

31858,Cymbeline,5,5.5.19,CYMBELINE,By whom I grant she lives. 'Tis now the time
31859,Cymbeline,5,5.5.20,CYMBELINE,To ask of whence you are. Report it.

31869,Cymbeline,7,5.5.29,CYMBELINE,There's business in these faces. Why so sadly
31870,Cymbeline,7,5.5.30,CYMBELINE,"Greet you our victory? you look like Romans,"
31871,Cymbeline,7,5.5.31,CYMBELINE,And not o' the court of Britain.
31872,Cymbeline,8,5.5.32,CORNELIUS,"Hail, great king!"
31873,Cymbeline,8,5.5.33,CORNELIUS,"To sour your happiness, I must report"
31874,Cymbeline,8,5.5.34,CORNELIUS,The queen is dead.
31875,Cymbeline,9,5.5.35,CYMBELINE,Who worse than a physician

31877,Cymbeline,9,5.5.37,CYMBELINE,"By medicine life may be prolong'd, yet death"
31878,Cymbeline,9,5.5.38,CYMBELINE,Will seize the doctor too. How ended she?
31879,Cymbeline,10,5.5.39,CORNELIUS,"With horror, madly dying, like her life,"
31880,Cymbeline,10,5.5.40,CORNELIUS,"Which, being cruel to the world, concluded"
31881,Cymbeline,10,5.5.41,CORNELIUS,Most cruel to herself. What she confess'd

31885,Cymbeline,11,5.5.45,CYMBELINE,"Prithee, say."
31886,Cymbeline,12,5.5.46,CORNELIUS,"First, she confess'd she never loved you, only"
31887,Cymbeline,12,5.5.47,CORNELIUS,"Affected greatness got by you, not you:"
31888,Cymbeline,12,5.5.48,CORNELIUS,"Married your royalty, was wife to your place,"
31889,Cymbeline,12,5.5.49,CORNELIUS,Abhorr'd your person.
31890,Cymbeline,13,5.5.50,CYMBELINE,"She alone knew this,"
31891,Cymbeline,13,5.5.51,CYMBELINE,"And, but she spoke it dying, I would not"
31892,Cymbeline,13,5.5.52,CYMBELINE,Believe her lips in opening it. Proceed.
31893,Cymbeline,14,5.5.53,CORNELIUS,"Your daughter, whom she bore in hand to love"
31894,Cymbeline,14,5.5.54,CORNELIUS,"With such integrity, she did confess"
31895,Cymbeline,14,5.5.55,CORNELIUS,"Was as a scorpion to her sight, whose life,"
31896,Cymbeline,14,5.5.56,CORNELIUS,"But that her flight prevented it, she had"
31897,Cymbeline,14,5.5.57,CORNELIUS,Ta'en off by poison.
31898,Cymbeline,15,5.5.58,CYMBELINE,O most delicate fiend!
31899,Cymbeline,15,5.5.59,CYMBELINE,Who is 't can read a woman? Is there more?
31900,Cymbeline,16,5.5.60,CORNELIUS,"More, sir, and worse. She did confess she had"
31901,Cymbeline,16,5.5.61,CORNELIUS,"For you a mortal mineral, which, being took,"
31902,Cymbeline,16,5.5.62,CORNELIUS,Should by the minute feed on life and lingering
31903,Cymbeline,16,5.5.63,CORNELIUS,"By inches waste you: in which time she purposed,"
31904,Cymbeline,16,5.5.64,CORNELIUS,"By watching, weeping, tendance, kissing, to"
31905,Cymbeline,16,5.5.65,CORNELIUS,"O'ercome you with her show, and in time,"
31906,Cymbeline,16,5.5.66,CORNELIUS,"When she had fitted you with her craft, to work"
31907,Cymbeline,16,5.5.67,CORNELIUS,Her son into the adoption of the crown:
31908,Cymbeline,16,5.5.68,CORNELIUS,"But, failing of her end by his strange absence,"
31909,Cymbeline,16,5.5.69,CORNELIUS,"Grew shameless-desperate, open'd, in despite"
31910,Cymbeline,16,5.5.70,CORNELIUS,"Of heaven and men, her purposes, repented"
31911,Cymbeline,16,5.5.71,CORNELIUS,"The evils she hatch'd were not effected, so"
31912,Cymbeline,16,5.5.72,CORNELIUS,Despairing died.
31913,Cymbeline,17,5.5.73,CYMBELINE,"Heard you all this, her women?"
31914,Cymbeline,18,5.5.74,First Lady,"We did, so please your highness."
31915,Cymbeline,19,5.5.75,CYMBELINE,Mine eyes
31916,Cymbeline,19,5.5.76,CYMBELINE,"Were not in fault, for she was beautiful,"
31917,Cymbeline,19,5.5.77,CYMBELINE,"Mine ears, that heard her flattery, nor my heart,"
31918,Cymbeline,19,5.5.78,CYMBELINE,"That thought her like her seeming, it had"
31919,Cymbeline,19,5.5.79,CYMBELINE,been vicious
31920,Cymbeline,19,5.5.80,CYMBELINE,"To have mistrusted her: yet, O my daughter!"
31921,Cymbeline,19,5.5.81,CYMBELINE,"That it was folly in me, thou mayst say,"
31922,Cymbeline,19,5.5.82,CYMBELINE,And prove it in thy feeling. Heaven mend all!

31925,Cymbeline,19,5.5.84,CYMBELINE,"The Britons have razed out, though with the loss"
31926,Cymbeline,19,5.5.85,CYMBELINE,"Of many a bold one, whose kinsmen have made suit"
31927,Cymbeline,19,5.5.86,CYMBELINE,That their good souls may be appeased with slaughter
31928,Cymbeline,19,5.5.87,CYMBELINE,"Of you their captives, which ourself have granted:"
31929,Cymbeline,19,5.5.88,CYMBELINE,So think of your estate.
31930,Cymbeline,20,5.5.89,CAIUS LUCIUS,"Consider, sir, the chance of war: the day"
31931,Cymbeline,20,5.5.90,CAIUS LUCIUS,"Was yours by accident, had it gone with us,"
31932,Cymbeline,20,5.5.91,CAIUS LUCIUS,"We should not, when the blood was cool,"
31933,Cymbeline,20,5.5.92,CAIUS LUCIUS,have threaten'd
31934,Cymbeline,20,5.5.93,CAIUS LUCIUS,Our prisoners with the sword. But since the gods
31935,Cymbeline,20,5.5.94,CAIUS LUCIUS,"Will have it thus, that nothing but our lives"
31936,Cymbeline,20,5.5.95,CAIUS LUCIUS,"May be call'd ransom, let it come: sufficeth"
31937,Cymbeline,20,5.5.96,CAIUS LUCIUS,A Roman with a Roman's heart can suffer:
31938,Cymbeline,20,5.5.97,CAIUS LUCIUS,Augustus lives to think on't: and so much
31939,Cymbeline,20,5.5.98,CAIUS LUCIUS,For my peculiar care. This one thing only
31940,Cymbeline,20,5.5.99,CAIUS LUCIUS,"I will entreat, my boy, a Briton born,"
31941,Cymbeline,20,5.5.100,CAIUS LUCIUS,Let him be ransom'd: never master had

31943,Cymbeline,20,5.5.102,CAIUS LUCIUS,"So tender over his occasions, true,"
31944,Cymbeline,20,5.5.103,CAIUS LUCIUS,"So feat, so nurse-like: let his virtue join"
31945,Cymbeline,20,5.5.104,CAIUS LUCIUS,"With my request, which I make bold your highness"

31948,Cymbeline,20,5.5.107,CAIUS LUCIUS,And spare no blood beside.
31949,Cymbeline,21,5.5.108,CYMBELINE,I have surely seen him:

31952,Cymbeline,21,5.5.111,CYMBELINE,"And art mine own. I know not why, wherefore,"
31953,Cymbeline,21,5.5.112,CYMBELINE,"To say 'live, boy:' ne'er thank thy master, live:"
31954,Cymbeline,21,5.5.113,CYMBELINE,"And ask of Cymbeline what boon thou wilt,"
31955,Cymbeline,21,5.5.114,CYMBELINE,"Fitting my bounty and thy state, I'll give it,"
31956,Cymbeline,21,5.5.115,CYMBELINE,"Yea, though thou do demand a prisoner,"
31957,Cymbeline,21,5.5.116,CYMBELINE,The noblest ta'en.
31958,Cymbeline,22,5.5.117,IMOGEN,I humbly thank your highness.

31960,Cymbeline,23,5.5.119,CAIUS LUCIUS,And yet I know thou wilt.
31961,Cymbeline,24,5.5.120,IMOGEN,"No, no: alack,"
31962,Cymbeline,24,5.5.121,IMOGEN,There's other work in hand: I see a thing
31963,Cymbeline,24,5.5.122,IMOGEN,"Bitter to me as death: your life, good master,"
31964,Cymbeline,24,5.5.123,IMOGEN,Must shuffle for itself.
31965,Cymbeline,25,5.5.124,CAIUS LUCIUS,"The boy disdains me,"
31966,Cymbeline,25,5.5.125,CAIUS LUCIUS,"He leaves me, scorns me: briefly die their joys"
31967,Cymbeline,25,5.5.126,CAIUS LUCIUS,That place them on the truth of girls and boys.
31968,Cymbeline,25,5.5.127,CAIUS LUCIUS,Why stands he so perplex'd?
31969,Cymbeline,26,5.5.128,CYMBELINE,"What wouldst thou, boy?"
31970,Cymbeline,26,5.5.129,CYMBELINE,I love thee more and more: think more and more
31971,Cymbeline,26,5.5.130,CYMBELINE,"What's best to ask. Know'st him thou look'st on? speak,"
31972,Cymbeline,26,5.5.131,CYMBELINE,Wilt have him live? Is he thy kin? thy friend?
31973,Cymbeline,27,5.5.132,IMOGEN,"He is a Roman, no more kin to me"
31974,Cymbeline,27,5.5.133,IMOGEN,"Than I to your highness, who, being born your vassal,"
31975,Cymbeline,27,5.5.134,IMOGEN,Am something nearer.
31976,Cymbeline,28,5.5.135,CYMBELINE,Wherefore eyest him so?
31977,Cymbeline,29,5.5.136,IMOGEN,"I'll tell you, sir, in private, if you please"
31978,Cymbeline,29,5.5.137,IMOGEN,To give me hearing.
31979,Cymbeline,30,5.5.138,CYMBELINE,"Ay, with all my heart,"
31980,Cymbeline,30,5.5.139,CYMBELINE,And lend my best attention. What's thy name?
31981,Cymbeline,31,5.5.140,IMOGEN,"Fidele, sir."
31982,Cymbeline,32,5.5.141,CYMBELINE,"Thou'rt my good youth, my page,"
31983,Cymbeline,32,5.5.142,CYMBELINE,"I'll be thy master: walk with me, speak freely."
31984,Cymbeline,32,,CYMBELINE,CYMBELINE and IMOGEN converse apart
31985,Cymbeline,33,5.5.143,BELARIUS,Is not this boy revived from death?
31986,Cymbeline,34,5.5.144,ARVIRAGUS,One sand another
31987,Cymbeline,34,5.5.145,ARVIRAGUS,Not more resembles that sweet rosy lad

31989,Cymbeline,35,5.5.147,GUIDERIUS,The same dead thing alive.
31990,Cymbeline,36,5.5.148,BELARIUS,"Peace, peace! see further, he eyes us not, forbear,"
31991,Cymbeline,36,5.5.149,BELARIUS,"Creatures may be alike: were 't he, I am sure"
31992,Cymbeline,36,5.5.150,BELARIUS,He would have spoke to us.
31993,Cymbeline,37,5.5.151,GUIDERIUS,But we saw him dead.
31994,Cymbeline,38,5.5.152,BELARIUS,"Be silent, let's see further."
31995,Cymbeline,39,5.5.153,PISANIO,"[Aside]	It is my mistress:"
31996,Cymbeline,39,5.5.154,PISANIO,"Since she is living, let the time run on"

31998,Cymbeline,39,,PISANIO,CYMBELINE and IMOGEN come forward
31999,Cymbeline,40,5.5.156,CYMBELINE,"Come, stand thou by our side,"
32000,Cymbeline,40,5.5.157,CYMBELINE,Make thy demand aloud.
32001,Cymbeline,40,,CYMBELINE,To IACHIMO
32002,Cymbeline,40,5.5.158,CYMBELINE,"Sir, step you forth,"
32003,Cymbeline,40,5.5.159,CYMBELINE,"Give answer to this boy, and do it freely,"
32004,Cymbeline,40,5.5.160,CYMBELINE,"Or, by our greatness and the grace of it,"
32005,Cymbeline,40,5.5.161,CYMBELINE,"Which is our honour, bitter torture shall"
32006,Cymbeline,40,5.5.162,CYMBELINE,"Winnow the truth from falsehood. On, speak to him."
32007,Cymbeline,41,5.5.163,IMOGEN,"My boon is, that this gentleman may render"
32008,Cymbeline,41,5.5.164,IMOGEN,Of whom he had this ring.
32009,Cymbeline,42,5.5.165,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,[Aside]                 What's that to him?
32010,Cymbeline,43,5.5.166,CYMBELINE,"That diamond upon your finger, say"
32011,Cymbeline,43,5.5.167,CYMBELINE,How came it yours?
32012,Cymbeline,44,5.5.168,IACHIMO,Thou'lt torture me to leave unspoken that
32013,Cymbeline,44,5.5.169,IACHIMO,"Which, to be spoke, would torture thee."
32014,Cymbeline,45,5.5.170,CYMBELINE,How! me?
32015,Cymbeline,46,5.5.171,IACHIMO,I am glad to be constrain'd to utter that
32016,Cymbeline,46,5.5.172,IACHIMO,Which torments me to conceal. By villany
32017,Cymbeline,46,5.5.173,IACHIMO,"I got this ring: 'twas Leonatus' jewel,"
32018,Cymbeline,46,5.5.174,IACHIMO,"Whom thou didst banish, and--which more may"
32019,Cymbeline,46,5.5.175,IACHIMO,"grieve thee,"
32020,Cymbeline,46,5.5.176,IACHIMO,As it doth me--a nobler sir ne'er lived
32021,Cymbeline,46,5.5.177,IACHIMO,"'Twixt sky and ground. Wilt thou hear more, my lord?"
32022,Cymbeline,47,5.5.178,CYMBELINE,All that belongs to this.
32023,Cymbeline,48,5.5.179,IACHIMO,"That paragon, thy daughter,--"
32024,Cymbeline,48,5.5.180,IACHIMO,"For whom my heart drops blood, and my false spirits"
32025,Cymbeline,48,5.5.181,IACHIMO,"Quail to remember--Give me leave, I faint."
32026,Cymbeline,49,5.5.182,CYMBELINE,My daughter! what of her? Renew thy strength:
32027,Cymbeline,49,5.5.183,CYMBELINE,I had rather thou shouldst live while nature will
32028,Cymbeline,49,5.5.184,CYMBELINE,"Than die ere I hear more: strive, man, and speak."
32029,Cymbeline,50,5.5.185,IACHIMO,"Upon a time,--unhappy was the clock"
32030,Cymbeline,50,5.5.186,IACHIMO,"That struck the hour!--it was in Rome,--accursed"
32031,Cymbeline,50,5.5.187,IACHIMO,"The mansion where!--'twas at a feast,--O, would"
32032,Cymbeline,50,5.5.188,IACHIMO,"Our viands had been poison'd, or at least"

32034,Cymbeline,50,5.5.190,IACHIMO,What should I say? he was too good to be
32035,Cymbeline,50,5.5.191,IACHIMO,"Where ill men were, and was the best of all"
32036,Cymbeline,50,5.5.192,IACHIMO,"Amongst the rarest of good ones,--sitting sadly,"
32037,Cymbeline,50,5.5.193,IACHIMO,Hearing us praise our loves of Italy
32038,Cymbeline,50,5.5.194,IACHIMO,For beauty that made barren the swell'd boast

32042,Cymbeline,50,5.5.198,IACHIMO,A shop of all the qualities that man
32043,Cymbeline,50,5.5.199,IACHIMO,"Loves woman for, besides that hook of wiving,"
32044,Cymbeline,50,5.5.200,IACHIMO,Fairness which strikes the eye--
32045,Cymbeline,51,5.5.201,CYMBELINE,I stand on fire:
32046,Cymbeline,51,5.5.202,CYMBELINE,Come to the matter.
32047,Cymbeline,52,5.5.203,IACHIMO,"All too soon I shall,"
32048,Cymbeline,52,5.5.204,IACHIMO,"Unless thou wouldst grieve quickly. This Posthumus,"
32049,Cymbeline,52,5.5.205,IACHIMO,Most like a noble lord in love and one
32050,Cymbeline,52,5.5.206,IACHIMO,"That had a royal lover, took his hint,"
32051,Cymbeline,52,5.5.207,IACHIMO,"And, not dispraising whom we praised,--therein"
32052,Cymbeline,52,5.5.208,IACHIMO,He was as calm as virtue--he began
32053,Cymbeline,52,5.5.209,IACHIMO,"His mistress' picture, which by his tongue"
32054,Cymbeline,52,5.5.210,IACHIMO,"being made,"
32055,Cymbeline,52,5.5.211,IACHIMO,"And then a mind put in't, either our brags"
32056,Cymbeline,52,5.5.212,IACHIMO,"Were crack'd of kitchen-trolls, or his description"
32057,Cymbeline,52,5.5.213,IACHIMO,Proved us unspeaking sots.
32058,Cymbeline,53,5.5.214,CYMBELINE,"Nay, nay, to the purpose."
32059,Cymbeline,54,5.5.215,IACHIMO,Your daughter's chastity--there it begins.
32060,Cymbeline,54,5.5.216,IACHIMO,"He spake of her, as Dian had hot dreams,"
32061,Cymbeline,54,5.5.217,IACHIMO,"And she alone were cold: whereat I, wretch,"
32062,Cymbeline,54,5.5.218,IACHIMO,"Made scruple of his praise, and wager'd with him"
32063,Cymbeline,54,5.5.219,IACHIMO,Pieces of gold 'gainst this which then he wore
32064,Cymbeline,54,5.5.220,IACHIMO,"Upon his honour'd finger, to attain"
32065,Cymbeline,54,5.5.221,IACHIMO,In suit the place of's bed and win this ring
32066,Cymbeline,54,5.5.222,IACHIMO,"By hers and mine adultery. He, true knight,"
32067,Cymbeline,54,5.5.223,IACHIMO,No lesser of her honour confident
32068,Cymbeline,54,5.5.224,IACHIMO,"Than I did truly find her, stakes this ring,"
32069,Cymbeline,54,5.5.225,IACHIMO,"And would so, had it been a carbuncle"
32070,Cymbeline,54,5.5.226,IACHIMO,"Of Phoebus' wheel, and might so safely, had it"
32071,Cymbeline,54,5.5.227,IACHIMO,Been all the worth of's car. Away to Britain
32072,Cymbeline,54,5.5.228,IACHIMO,"Post I in this design: well may you, sir,"
32073,Cymbeline,54,5.5.229,IACHIMO,"Remember me at court, where I was taught"
32074,Cymbeline,54,5.5.230,IACHIMO,Of your chaste daughter the wide difference
32075,Cymbeline,54,5.5.231,IACHIMO,'Twixt amorous and villanous. Being thus quench'd
32076,Cymbeline,54,5.5.232,IACHIMO,"Of hope, not longing, mine Italian brain"
32077,Cymbeline,54,5.5.233,IACHIMO,'Gan in your duller Britain operate

32079,Cymbeline,54,5.5.235,IACHIMO,"And, to be brief, my practise so prevail'd,"
32080,Cymbeline,54,5.5.236,IACHIMO,That I return'd with simular proof enough
32081,Cymbeline,54,5.5.237,IACHIMO,"To make the noble Leonatus mad,"
32082,Cymbeline,54,5.5.238,IACHIMO,By wounding his belief in her renown
32083,Cymbeline,54,5.5.239,IACHIMO,"With tokens thus, and thus, averting notes"
32084,Cymbeline,54,5.5.240,IACHIMO,"Of chamber-hanging, pictures, this her bracelet,--"
32085,Cymbeline,54,5.5.241,IACHIMO,"O cunning, how I got it!--nay, some marks"
32086,Cymbeline,54,5.5.242,IACHIMO,"Of secret on her person, that he could not"
32087,Cymbeline,54,5.5.243,IACHIMO,"But think her bond of chastity quite crack'd,"
32088,Cymbeline,54,5.5.244,IACHIMO,I having ta'en the forfeit. Whereupon--
32089,Cymbeline,54,5.5.245,IACHIMO,"Methinks, I see him now--"
32090,Cymbeline,55,5.5.246,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"[Advancing]             Ay, so thou dost,"
32091,Cymbeline,55,5.5.247,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Italian fiend! Ay me, most credulous fool,"
32092,Cymbeline,55,5.5.248,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Egregious murderer, thief, any thing"
32093,Cymbeline,55,5.5.249,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"That's due to all the villains past, in being,"
32094,Cymbeline,55,5.5.250,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"To come! O, give me cord, or knife, or poison,"
32095,Cymbeline,55,5.5.251,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Some upright justicer! Thou, king, send out"
32096,Cymbeline,55,5.5.252,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,For torturers ingenious: it is I
32097,Cymbeline,55,5.5.253,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,That all the abhorred things o' the earth amend
32098,Cymbeline,55,5.5.254,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"By being worse than they. I am Posthumus,"
32099,Cymbeline,55,5.5.255,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"That kill'd thy daughter:--villain-like, I lie--"
32100,Cymbeline,55,5.5.256,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"That caused a lesser villain than myself,"
32101,Cymbeline,55,5.5.257,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"A sacrilegious thief, to do't: the temple"
32102,Cymbeline,55,5.5.258,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Of virtue was she, yea, and she herself."
32103,Cymbeline,55,5.5.259,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Spit, and throw stone s, cast mire upon me, set"
32104,Cymbeline,55,5.5.260,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,The dogs o' the street to bay me: every villain

32106,Cymbeline,55,5.5.262,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,Be villany less than 'twas! O Imogen!
32107,Cymbeline,55,5.5.263,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"My queen, my life, my wife! O Imogen,"
32108,Cymbeline,55,5.5.264,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Imogen, Imogen!"
32109,Cymbeline,56,5.5.265,IMOGEN,"Peace, my lord, hear, hear--"
32110,Cymbeline,57,5.5.266,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Shall's have a play of this? Thou scornful page,"
32111,Cymbeline,57,5.5.267,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,There lie thy part.
32112,Cymbeline,57,5.5.267,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,Striking her: she falls
32113,Cymbeline,58,5.5.268,PISANIO,"O, gentlemen, help!"
32114,Cymbeline,58,5.5.269,PISANIO,"Mine and your mistress! O, my lord Posthumus!"
32115,Cymbeline,58,5.5.270,PISANIO,"You ne'er kill'd Imogen til now. Help, help!"
32116,Cymbeline,58,5.5.271,PISANIO,Mine honour'd lady!
32117,Cymbeline,59,5.5.272,CYMBELINE,Does the world go round?
32118,Cymbeline,60,5.5.273,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,How come these staggers on me?
32119,Cymbeline,61,5.5.274,PISANIO,"Wake, my mistress!"
32120,Cymbeline,62,5.5.275,CYMBELINE,"If this be so, the gods do mean to strike me"
32121,Cymbeline,62,5.5.276,CYMBELINE,To death with mortal joy.
32122,Cymbeline,63,5.5.277,PISANIO,How fares thy mistress?
32123,Cymbeline,64,5.5.278,IMOGEN,"O, get thee from my sight,"
32124,Cymbeline,64,5.5.279,IMOGEN,"Thou gavest me poison: dangerous fellow, hence!"
32125,Cymbeline,64,5.5.280,IMOGEN,Breathe not where princes are.
32126,Cymbeline,65,5.5.281,CYMBELINE,The tune of Imogen!
32127,Cymbeline,66,5.5.282,PISANIO,"Lady,"
32128,Cymbeline,66,5.5.283,PISANIO,"The gods throw stones of sulphur on me, if"
32129,Cymbeline,66,5.5.284,PISANIO,That box I gave you was not thought by me
32130,Cymbeline,66,5.5.285,PISANIO,A precious thing: I had it from the queen.
32131,Cymbeline,67,5.5.286,CYMBELINE,New matter still?
32132,Cymbeline,68,5.5.287,IMOGEN,It poison'd me.
32133,Cymbeline,69,5.5.288,CORNELIUS,O gods!
32134,Cymbeline,69,5.5.289,CORNELIUS,I left out one thing which the queen confess'd.
32135,Cymbeline,69,5.5.290,CORNELIUS,Which must approve thee honest: 'If Pisanio
32136,Cymbeline,69,5.5.291,CORNELIUS,"Have,' said she, 'given his mistress that confection"
32137,Cymbeline,69,5.5.292,CORNELIUS,"Which I gave him for cordial, she is served"
32138,Cymbeline,69,5.5.293,CORNELIUS,As I would serve a rat.'
32139,Cymbeline,70,5.5.294,CYMBELINE,"What's this, Comelius?"
32140,Cymbeline,71,5.5.295,CORNELIUS,"The queen, sir, very oft importuned me"
32141,Cymbeline,71,5.5.296,CORNELIUS,"To temper poisons for her, still pretending"
32142,Cymbeline,71,5.5.297,CORNELIUS,The satisfaction of her knowledge only
32143,Cymbeline,71,5.5.298,CORNELIUS,"In killing creatures vile, as cats and dogs,"
32144,Cymbeline,71,5.5.299,CORNELIUS,"Of no esteem: I, dreading that her purpose"
32145,Cymbeline,71,5.5.300,CORNELIUS,"Was of more danger, did compound for her"
32146,Cymbeline,71,5.5.301,CORNELIUS,"A certain stuff, which, being ta'en, would cease"
32147,Cymbeline,71,5.5.302,CORNELIUS,"The present power of life, but in short time"
32148,Cymbeline,71,5.5.303,CORNELIUS,All offices of nature should again
32149,Cymbeline,71,5.5.304,CORNELIUS,Do their due functions. Have you ta'en of it?
32150,Cymbeline,72,5.5.305,IMOGEN,"Most like I did, for I was dead."
32151,Cymbeline,73,5.5.306,BELARIUS,"My boys,"
32152,Cymbeline,73,5.5.307,BELARIUS,There was our error.
32153,Cymbeline,74,5.5.308,GUIDERIUS,"This is, sure, Fidele."
32154,Cymbeline,75,5.5.309,IMOGEN,Why did you throw your wedded lady from you?
32155,Cymbeline,75,5.5.310,IMOGEN,"Think that you are upon a rock, and now"
32156,Cymbeline,75,5.5.311,IMOGEN,Throw me again.
32157,Cymbeline,75,,IMOGEN,Embracing him
32158,Cymbeline,76,5.5.312,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Hang there like a fruit, my soul,"
32159,Cymbeline,76,5.5.313,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,Till the tree die!
32160,Cymbeline,77,5.5.314,CYMBELINE,"How now, my flesh, my child!"
32161,Cymbeline,77,5.5.315,CYMBELINE,"What, makest thou me a dullard in this act?"
32162,Cymbeline,77,5.5.316,CYMBELINE,Wilt thou not speak to me?
32163,Cymbeline,78,5.5.317,IMOGEN,"[Kneeling]               Your blessing, sir."
32164,Cymbeline,79,5.5.318,BELARIUS,[To GUIDERIUS and ARVIRAGUS]  Though you did love
32165,Cymbeline,79,5.5.319,BELARIUS,"this youth, I blame ye not:"
32166,Cymbeline,79,5.5.320,BELARIUS,You had a motive for't.
32167,Cymbeline,80,5.5.321,CYMBELINE,My tears that fall
32168,Cymbeline,80,5.5.322,CYMBELINE,"Prove holy water on thee! Imogen,"
32169,Cymbeline,80,5.5.323,CYMBELINE,Thy mother's dead.
32170,Cymbeline,81,5.5.324,IMOGEN,"I am sorry for't, my lord."
32171,Cymbeline,82,5.5.325,CYMBELINE,"O, she was nought, and long of her it was"
32172,Cymbeline,82,5.5.326,CYMBELINE,That we meet here so strangely: but her son
32173,Cymbeline,82,5.5.327,CYMBELINE,"Is gone, we know not how nor where."
32174,Cymbeline,83,5.5.328,PISANIO,"My lord,"
32175,Cymbeline,83,5.5.329,PISANIO,"Now fear is from me, I'll speak troth. Lord Cloten,"
32176,Cymbeline,83,5.5.330,PISANIO,"Upon my lady's missing, came to me"
32177,Cymbeline,83,5.5.331,PISANIO,"With his sword drawn, foam'd at the mouth, and swore,"
32178,Cymbeline,83,5.5.332,PISANIO,"If I discover'd not which way she was gone,"
32179,Cymbeline,83,5.5.333,PISANIO,"It was my instant death. By accident,"
32180,Cymbeline,83,5.5.334,PISANIO,had a feigned letter of my master's
32181,Cymbeline,83,5.5.335,PISANIO,"Then in my pocket, which directed him"
32182,Cymbeline,83,5.5.336,PISANIO,"To seek her on the mountains near to Milford,"
32183,Cymbeline,83,5.5.337,PISANIO,"Where, in a frenzy, in my master's garments,"
32184,Cymbeline,83,5.5.338,PISANIO,"Which he enforced from me, away he posts"
32185,Cymbeline,83,5.5.339,PISANIO,With unchaste purpose and with oath to violate
32186,Cymbeline,83,5.5.340,PISANIO,My lady's honour: what became of him
32187,Cymbeline,83,5.5.341,PISANIO,I further know not.
32188,Cymbeline,84,5.5.342,GUIDERIUS,Let me end the story:
32189,Cymbeline,84,5.5.343,GUIDERIUS,I slew him there.
32190,Cymbeline,85,5.5.344,CYMBELINE,"Marry, the gods forfend!"
32191,Cymbeline,85,5.5.345,CYMBELINE,I would not thy good deeds should from my lips
32192,Cymbeline,85,5.5.346,CYMBELINE,"Pluck a bard sentence: prithee, valiant youth,"
32193,Cymbeline,85,5.5.347,CYMBELINE,Deny't again.
32194,Cymbeline,86,5.5.348,GUIDERIUS,"I have spoke it, and I did it."
32195,Cymbeline,87,5.5.349,CYMBELINE,He was a prince.
32196,Cymbeline,88,5.5.350,GUIDERIUS,A most incivil one: the wrongs he did me
32197,Cymbeline,88,5.5.351,GUIDERIUS,"Were nothing prince-like, for he did provoke me"
32198,Cymbeline,88,5.5.352,GUIDERIUS,"With language that would make me spurn the sea,"
32199,Cymbeline,88,5.5.353,GUIDERIUS,"If it could so roar to me: I cut off's head,"
32200,Cymbeline,88,5.5.354,GUIDERIUS,And am right glad he is not standing here
32201,Cymbeline,88,5.5.355,GUIDERIUS,To tell this tale of mine.
32202,Cymbeline,89,5.5.356,CYMBELINE,I am sorry for thee:
32203,Cymbeline,89,5.5.357,CYMBELINE,"By thine own tongue thou art condemn'd, and must"
32204,Cymbeline,89,5.5.358,CYMBELINE,Endure our law: thou'rt dead.
32205,Cymbeline,90,5.5.359,IMOGEN,That headless man
32206,Cymbeline,90,5.5.360,IMOGEN,I thought had been my lord.
32207,Cymbeline,91,5.5.361,CYMBELINE,"Bind the offender,"
32208,Cymbeline,91,5.5.362,CYMBELINE,And take him from our presence.
32209,Cymbeline,92,5.5.363,BELARIUS,"Stay, sir king:"
32210,Cymbeline,92,5.5.364,BELARIUS,"This man is better than the man he slew,"
32211,Cymbeline,92,5.5.365,BELARIUS,"As well descended as thyself, and hath"
32212,Cymbeline,92,5.5.366,BELARIUS,More of thee merited than a band of Clotens
32213,Cymbeline,92,5.5.367,BELARIUS,Had ever scar for.
32214,Cymbeline,92,,BELARIUS,To the Guard
32215,Cymbeline,92,5.5.368,BELARIUS,"Let his arms alone,"
32216,Cymbeline,92,5.5.369,BELARIUS,They were not born for bondage.
32217,Cymbeline,93,5.5.370,CYMBELINE,"Why, old soldier,"
32218,Cymbeline,93,5.5.371,CYMBELINE,"Wilt thou undo the worth thou art unpaid for,"
32219,Cymbeline,93,5.5.372,CYMBELINE,By tasting of our wrath? How of descent
32220,Cymbeline,93,5.5.373,CYMBELINE,As good as we?
32221,Cymbeline,94,5.5.374,ARVIRAGUS,In that he spake too far.
32222,Cymbeline,95,5.5.375,CYMBELINE,And thou shalt die for't.
32223,Cymbeline,96,5.5.376,BELARIUS,We will die all three:
32224,Cymbeline,96,5.5.377,BELARIUS,But I will prove that two on's are as good
32225,Cymbeline,96,5.5.378,BELARIUS,"As I have given out him. My sons, I must,"
32226,Cymbeline,96,5.5.379,BELARIUS,"For mine own part, unfold a dangerous speech,"
32227,Cymbeline,96,5.5.380,BELARIUS,"Though, haply, well for you."
32228,Cymbeline,97,5.5.381,ARVIRAGUS,Your danger's ours.
32229,Cymbeline,98,5.5.382,GUIDERIUS,And our good his.
32230,Cymbeline,99,5.5.383,BELARIUS,"Have at it then, by leave."
32231,Cymbeline,99,5.5.384,BELARIUS,"Thou hadst, great king, a subject who"
32232,Cymbeline,99,5.5.385,BELARIUS,Was call'd Belarius.
32233,Cymbeline,100,5.5.386,CYMBELINE,What of him? he is
32234,Cymbeline,100,5.5.387,CYMBELINE,A banish'd traitor.
32235,Cymbeline,101,5.5.388,BELARIUS,He it is that hath
32236,Cymbeline,101,5.5.389,BELARIUS,"Assumed this age, indeed a banish'd man,"
32237,Cymbeline,101,5.5.390,BELARIUS,I know not how a traitor.
32238,Cymbeline,102,5.5.391,CYMBELINE,Take him hence:
32239,Cymbeline,102,5.5.392,CYMBELINE,The whole world shall not save him.
32240,Cymbeline,103,5.5.393,BELARIUS,Not too hot:
32241,Cymbeline,103,5.5.394,BELARIUS,"First pay me for the nursing of thy sons,"
32242,Cymbeline,103,5.5.395,BELARIUS,"And let it be confiscate all, so soon"
32243,Cymbeline,103,5.5.396,BELARIUS,As I have received it.
32244,Cymbeline,104,5.5.397,CYMBELINE,Nursing of my sons!
32245,Cymbeline,105,5.5.398,BELARIUS,I am too blunt and saucy: here's my knee:
32246,Cymbeline,105,5.5.399,BELARIUS,"Ere I arise, I will prefer my sons,"
32247,Cymbeline,105,5.5.400,BELARIUS,"Then spare not the old father. Mighty sir,"
32248,Cymbeline,105,5.5.401,BELARIUS,"These two young gentlemen, that call me father"
32249,Cymbeline,105,5.5.402,BELARIUS,"And think they are my sons, are none of mine,"
32250,Cymbeline,105,5.5.403,BELARIUS,"They are the issue of your loins, my liege,"
32251,Cymbeline,105,5.5.404,BELARIUS,And blood of your begetting.
32252,Cymbeline,106,5.5.405,CYMBELINE,How! my issue!
32253,Cymbeline,107,5.5.406,BELARIUS,"So sure as you your father's. I, old Morgan,"
32254,Cymbeline,107,5.5.407,BELARIUS,Am that Belarius whom you sometime banish'd:
32255,Cymbeline,107,5.5.408,BELARIUS,"Your pleasure was my mere offence, my punishment"
32256,Cymbeline,107,5.5.409,BELARIUS,"Itself, and all my treason, that I suffer'd"
32257,Cymbeline,107,5.5.410,BELARIUS,Was all the harm I did. These gentle princes--
32258,Cymbeline,107,5.5.411,BELARIUS,For such and so they are--these twenty years
32259,Cymbeline,107,5.5.412,BELARIUS,Have I train'd up: those arts they have as I
32260,Cymbeline,107,5.5.413,BELARIUS,"Could put into them, my breeding was, sir, as"
32261,Cymbeline,107,5.5.414,BELARIUS,"Your highness knows. Their nurse, Euriphile,"
32262,Cymbeline,107,5.5.415,BELARIUS,"Whom for the theft I wedded, stole these children"
32263,Cymbeline,107,5.5.416,BELARIUS,"Upon my banishment: I moved her to't,"
32264,Cymbeline,107,5.5.417,BELARIUS,"Having received the punishment before,"
32265,Cymbeline,107,5.5.418,BELARIUS,For that which I did then: beaten for loyalty
32266,Cymbeline,107,5.5.419,BELARIUS,"Excited me to treason: their dear loss,"
32267,Cymbeline,107,5.5.420,BELARIUS,"The more of you 'twas felt, the more it shaped"
32268,Cymbeline,107,5.5.421,BELARIUS,"Unto my end of stealing them. But, gracious sir,"
32269,Cymbeline,107,5.5.422,BELARIUS,"Here are your sons again, and I must lose"
32270,Cymbeline,107,5.5.423,BELARIUS,Two of the sweet'st companions in the world.
32271,Cymbeline,107,5.5.424,BELARIUS,The benediction of these covering heavens
32272,Cymbeline,107,5.5.425,BELARIUS,Fall on their heads like dew! for they are worthy
32273,Cymbeline,107,5.5.426,BELARIUS,To inlay heaven with stars.
32274,Cymbeline,108,5.5.427,CYMBELINE,"Thou weep'st, and speak'st."
32275,Cymbeline,108,5.5.428,CYMBELINE,The service that you three have done is more
32276,Cymbeline,108,5.5.429,CYMBELINE,Unlike than this thou tell'st. I lost my children:
32277,Cymbeline,108,5.5.430,CYMBELINE,"If these be they, I know not how to wish"
32278,Cymbeline,108,5.5.431,CYMBELINE,A pair of worthier sons.
32279,Cymbeline,109,5.5.432,BELARIUS,Be pleased awhile.
32280,Cymbeline,109,5.5.433,BELARIUS,"This gentleman, whom I call Polydore,"
32281,Cymbeline,109,5.5.434,BELARIUS,"Most worthy prince, as yours, is true Guiderius:"
32282,Cymbeline,109,5.5.435,BELARIUS,"This gentleman, my Cadwal, Arviragus,"
32283,Cymbeline,109,5.5.436,BELARIUS,"Your younger princely son, he, sir, was lapp'd"
32284,Cymbeline,109,5.5.437,BELARIUS,"In a most curious mantle, wrought by the hand"
32285,Cymbeline,109,5.5.438,BELARIUS,"Of his queen mother, which for more probation"
32286,Cymbeline,109,5.5.439,BELARIUS,I can with ease produce.
32287,Cymbeline,110,5.5.440,CYMBELINE,Guiderius had
32288,Cymbeline,110,5.5.441,CYMBELINE,"Upon his neck a mole, a sanguine star,"
32289,Cymbeline,110,5.5.442,CYMBELINE,It was a mark of wonder.
32290,Cymbeline,111,5.5.443,BELARIUS,"This is he,"
32291,Cymbeline,111,5.5.444,BELARIUS,Who hath upon him still that natural stamp:
32292,Cymbeline,111,5.5.445,BELARIUS,"It was wise nature's end in the donation,"
32293,Cymbeline,111,5.5.446,BELARIUS,To be his evidence now.
32294,Cymbeline,112,5.5.447,CYMBELINE,"O, what, am I"
32295,Cymbeline,112,5.5.448,CYMBELINE,A mother to the birth of three? Ne'er mother
32296,Cymbeline,112,5.5.449,CYMBELINE,"Rejoiced deliverance more. Blest pray you be,"
32297,Cymbeline,112,5.5.450,CYMBELINE,"That, after this strange starting from your orbs,"
32298,Cymbeline,112,5.5.451,CYMBELINE,"may reign in them now! O Imogen,"
32299,Cymbeline,112,5.5.452,CYMBELINE,Thou hast lost by this a kingdom.
32300,Cymbeline,113,5.5.453,IMOGEN,"No, my lord,"
32301,Cymbeline,113,5.5.454,IMOGEN,"I have got two worlds by 't. O my gentle brothers,"
32302,Cymbeline,113,5.5.455,IMOGEN,"Have we thus met? O, never say hereafter"
32303,Cymbeline,113,5.5.456,IMOGEN,"But I am truest speaker you call'd me brother,"
32304,Cymbeline,113,5.5.457,IMOGEN,"When I was but your sister, I you brothers,"
32305,Cymbeline,113,5.5.458,IMOGEN,When ye were so indeed.
32306,Cymbeline,114,5.5.459,CYMBELINE,Did you e'er meet?
32307,Cymbeline,115,5.5.460,ARVIRAGUS,"Ay, my good lord."
32308,Cymbeline,116,5.5.461,GUIDERIUS,"And at first meeting loved,"
32309,Cymbeline,116,5.5.462,GUIDERIUS,"Continued so, until we thought he died."
32310,Cymbeline,117,5.5.463,CORNELIUS,By the queen's dram she swallow'd.
32311,Cymbeline,118,5.5.464,CYMBELINE,O rare instinct!
32312,Cymbeline,118,5.5.465,CYMBELINE,When shall I hear all through? This fierce
32313,Cymbeline,118,5.5.466,CYMBELINE,abridgement
32314,Cymbeline,118,5.5.467,CYMBELINE,"Hath to it circumstantial branches, which"
32315,Cymbeline,118,5.5.468,CYMBELINE,Distinction should be rich in. Where? how lived You?
32316,Cymbeline,118,5.5.469,CYMBELINE,And when came you to serve our Roman captive?
32317,Cymbeline,118,5.5.470,CYMBELINE,How parted with your brothers? how first met them?
32318,Cymbeline,118,5.5.471,CYMBELINE,"Why fled you from the court? and whither? These,"
32319,Cymbeline,118,5.5.472,CYMBELINE,"And your three motives to the battle, with"
32320,Cymbeline,118,5.5.473,CYMBELINE,"I know not how much more, should be demanded,"
32321,Cymbeline,118,5.5.474,CYMBELINE,"And all the other by-dependencies,"
32322,Cymbeline,118,5.5.475,CYMBELINE,From chance to chance: but nor the time nor place
32323,Cymbeline,118,5.5.476,CYMBELINE,"Will serve our long inter'gatories. See,"
32324,Cymbeline,118,5.5.477,CYMBELINE,"Posthumus anchors upon Imogen,"
32325,Cymbeline,118,5.5.478,CYMBELINE,"And she, like harmless lightning, throws her eye"
32326,Cymbeline,118,5.5.479,CYMBELINE,"On him, her brother, me, her master, hitting"
32327,Cymbeline,118,5.5.480,CYMBELINE,Each object with a joy: the counterchange
32328,Cymbeline,118,5.5.481,CYMBELINE,"Is severally in all. Let's quit this ground,"
32329,Cymbeline,118,5.5.482,CYMBELINE,And smoke the temple with our sacrifices.
32330,Cymbeline,118,,CYMBELINE,To BELARIUS
32331,Cymbeline,118,5.5.483,CYMBELINE,"Thou art my brother, so we'll hold thee ever."
32332,Cymbeline,119,5.5.484,IMOGEN,"You are my father too, and did relieve me,"
32333,Cymbeline,119,5.5.485,IMOGEN,To see this gracious season.
32334,Cymbeline,120,5.5.486,CYMBELINE,"All o'erjoy'd,"
32335,Cymbeline,120,5.5.487,CYMBELINE,"Save these in bonds: let them be joyful too,"
32336,Cymbeline,120,5.5.488,CYMBELINE,For they shall taste our comfort.
32337,Cymbeline,121,5.5.489,IMOGEN,"My good master,"
32338,Cymbeline,121,5.5.490,IMOGEN,I will yet do you service.
32339,Cymbeline,122,5.5.491,CAIUS LUCIUS,Happy be you!
32340,Cymbeline,123,5.5.492,CYMBELINE,"The forlorn soldier, that so nobly fought,"
32341,Cymbeline,123,5.5.493,CYMBELINE,"He would have well becomed this place, and graced"
32342,Cymbeline,123,5.5.494,CYMBELINE,The thankings of a king.
32343,Cymbeline,124,5.5.495,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"I am, sir,"
32344,Cymbeline,124,5.5.496,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,The soldier that did company these three
32345,Cymbeline,124,5.5.497,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"In poor beseeming, 'twas a fitment for"
32346,Cymbeline,124,5.5.498,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"The purpose I then follow'd. That I was he,"
32347,Cymbeline,124,5.5.499,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Speak, Iachimo: I had you down and might"
32348,Cymbeline,124,5.5.500,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,Have made you finish.
32349,Cymbeline,125,5.5.501,IACHIMO,[Kneeling]          I am down again:
32350,Cymbeline,125,5.5.502,IACHIMO,"But now my heavy conscience sinks my knee,"
32351,Cymbeline,125,5.5.503,IACHIMO,"As then your force did. Take that life, beseech you,"
32352,Cymbeline,125,5.5.504,IACHIMO,"Which I so often owe: but your ring first,"
32353,Cymbeline,125,5.5.505,IACHIMO,And here the bracelet of the truest princess
32354,Cymbeline,125,5.5.506,IACHIMO,That ever swore her faith.
32355,Cymbeline,126,5.5.507,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,Kneel not to me:
32356,Cymbeline,126,5.5.508,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"The power that I have on you is, to spare you,"
32357,Cymbeline,126,5.5.509,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"The malice towards you to forgive you: live,"
32358,Cymbeline,126,5.5.510,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,And deal with others better.
32359,Cymbeline,127,5.5.511,CYMBELINE,Nobly doom'd!

32361,Cymbeline,127,5.5.513,CYMBELINE,Pardon's the word to all.

32364,Cymbeline,128,5.5.516,ARVIRAGUS,Joy'd are we that you are.
32365,Cymbeline,129,5.5.517,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Your servant, princes. Good my lord of Rome,"

32387,Cymbeline,133,5.5.539,Soothsayer,"Being Leonatus, doth import so much."
32388,Cymbeline,133,,Soothsayer,To CYMBELINE

32434,Hamlet,138,,CYMBELINE,SCENE I. Elsinore. A platform before the castle.
32435,Hamlet,138,,CYMBELINE,FRANCISCO at his post. Enter to him BERNARDO
32436,Hamlet,1,1.1.1,BERNARDO,Who's there?
32437,Hamlet,2,1.1.2,FRANCISCO,"Nay, answer me: stand, and unfold yourself."
32438,Hamlet,3,1.1.3,BERNARDO,Long live the king!
32439,Hamlet,4,1.1.4,FRANCISCO,Bernardo?
32440,Hamlet,5,1.1.5,BERNARDO,He.
32441,Hamlet,6,1.1.6,FRANCISCO,You come most carefully upon your hour.
32442,Hamlet,7,1.1.7,BERNARDO,"'Tis now struck twelve, get thee to bed, Francisco."
32443,Hamlet,8,1.1.8,FRANCISCO,"For this relief much thanks: 'tis bitter cold,"
32444,Hamlet,8,1.1.9,FRANCISCO,And I am sick at heart.
32445,Hamlet,9,1.1.10,BERNARDO,Have you had quiet guard?
32446,Hamlet,10,1.1.11,FRANCISCO,Not a mouse stirring.
32447,Hamlet,11,1.1.12,BERNARDO,"Well, good night."
32448,Hamlet,11,1.1.13,BERNARDO,"If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,"
32449,Hamlet,11,1.1.14,BERNARDO,"The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste."
32450,Hamlet,12,1.1.15,FRANCISCO,"I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who's there?"
32451,Hamlet,12,,FRANCISCO,Enter HORATIO and MARCELLUS
32452,Hamlet,13,1.1.16,HORATIO,Friends to this ground.
32453,Hamlet,14,1.1.17,MARCELLUS,And liegemen to the Dane.
32454,Hamlet,15,1.1.18,FRANCISCO,Give you good night.
32455,Hamlet,16,1.1.19,MARCELLUS,"O, farewell, honest soldier:"
32456,Hamlet,16,1.1.20,MARCELLUS,Who hath relieved you?
32457,Hamlet,17,1.1.21,FRANCISCO,Bernardo has my place.

32461,Hamlet,19,1.1.24,BERNARDO,"Say,"
32462,Hamlet,19,1.1.25,BERNARDO,"What, is Horatio there?"
32463,Hamlet,20,1.1.26,HORATIO,A piece of him.
32464,Hamlet,21,1.1.27,BERNARDO,"Welcome, Horatio: welcome, good Marcellus."
32465,Hamlet,22,1.1.28,MARCELLUS,"What, has this thing appear'd again to-night?"
32466,Hamlet,23,1.1.29,BERNARDO,I have seen nothing.
32467,Hamlet,24,1.1.30,MARCELLUS,"Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy,"
32468,Hamlet,24,1.1.31,MARCELLUS,And will not let belief take hold of him
32469,Hamlet,24,1.1.32,MARCELLUS,"Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us:"
32470,Hamlet,24,1.1.33,MARCELLUS,Therefore I have entreated him along
32471,Hamlet,24,1.1.34,MARCELLUS,"With us to watch the minutes of this night,"
32472,Hamlet,24,1.1.35,MARCELLUS,"That if again this apparition come,"
32473,Hamlet,24,1.1.36,MARCELLUS,He may approve our eyes and speak to it.
32474,Hamlet,25,1.1.37,HORATIO,"Tush, tush, 'twill not appear."
32475,Hamlet,26,1.1.38,BERNARDO,"Sit down awhile,"
32476,Hamlet,26,1.1.39,BERNARDO,"And let us once again assail your ears,"
32477,Hamlet,26,1.1.40,BERNARDO,That are so fortified against our story
32478,Hamlet,26,1.1.41,BERNARDO,What we have two nights seen.
32479,Hamlet,27,1.1.42,HORATIO,"Well, sit we down,"
32480,Hamlet,27,1.1.43,HORATIO,And let us hear Bernardo speak of this.
32481,Hamlet,28,1.1.44,BERNARDO,"Last night of all,"
32482,Hamlet,28,1.1.45,BERNARDO,When yond same star that's westward from the pole
32483,Hamlet,28,1.1.46,BERNARDO,Had made his course to illume that part of heaven
32484,Hamlet,28,1.1.47,BERNARDO,"Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,"
32485,Hamlet,28,1.1.48,BERNARDO,"The bell then beating one,--"
32486,Hamlet,28,,BERNARDO,Enter Ghost
32487,Hamlet,29,1.1.49,MARCELLUS,"Peace, break thee off, look, where it comes again!"
32488,Hamlet,30,1.1.50,BERNARDO,"In the same figure, like the king that's dead."
32489,Hamlet,31,1.1.51,MARCELLUS,"Thou art a scholar, speak to it, Horatio."
32490,Hamlet,32,1.1.52,BERNARDO,"Looks it not like the king?  mark it, Horatio."
32491,Hamlet,33,1.1.53,HORATIO,Most like: it harrows me with fear and wonder.
32492,Hamlet,34,1.1.54,BERNARDO,It would be spoke to.
32493,Hamlet,35,1.1.55,MARCELLUS,"Question it, Horatio."
32494,Hamlet,36,1.1.56,HORATIO,"What art thou that usurp'st this time of night,"
32495,Hamlet,36,1.1.57,HORATIO,Together with that fair and warlike form
32496,Hamlet,36,1.1.58,HORATIO,In which the majesty of buried Denmark
32497,Hamlet,36,1.1.59,HORATIO,"Did sometimes march? by heaven I charge thee, speak!"
32498,Hamlet,37,1.1.60,MARCELLUS,It is offended.
32499,Hamlet,38,1.1.61,BERNARDO,"See, it stalks away!"
32500,Hamlet,39,1.1.62,HORATIO,"Stay! speak, speak! I charge thee, speak!"
32501,Hamlet,39,,HORATIO,Exit Ghost
32502,Hamlet,40,1.1.63,MARCELLUS,"'Tis gone, and will not answer."
32503,Hamlet,41,1.1.64,BERNARDO,"How now, Horatio! you tremble and look pale:"
32504,Hamlet,41,1.1.65,BERNARDO,Is not this something more than fantasy?
32505,Hamlet,41,1.1.66,BERNARDO,What think you on't?
32506,Hamlet,42,1.1.67,HORATIO,"Before my God, I might not this believe"
32507,Hamlet,42,1.1.68,HORATIO,Without the sensible and true avouch
32508,Hamlet,42,1.1.69,HORATIO,Of mine own eyes.
32509,Hamlet,43,1.1.70,MARCELLUS,Is it not like the king?
32510,Hamlet,44,1.1.71,HORATIO,As thou art to thyself:
32511,Hamlet,44,1.1.72,HORATIO,Such was the very armour he had on
32512,Hamlet,44,1.1.73,HORATIO,"When he the ambitious Norway combated,"
32513,Hamlet,44,1.1.74,HORATIO,"So frown'd he once, when, in an angry parle,"
32514,Hamlet,44,1.1.75,HORATIO,He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.
32515,Hamlet,44,1.1.76,HORATIO,'Tis strange.
32516,Hamlet,45,1.1.77,MARCELLUS,"Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,"
32517,Hamlet,45,1.1.78,MARCELLUS,With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.
32518,Hamlet,46,1.1.79,HORATIO,"In what particular thought to work I know not,"
32519,Hamlet,46,1.1.80,HORATIO,"But in the gross and scope of my opinion,"
32520,Hamlet,46,1.1.81,HORATIO,This bodes some strange eruption to our state.
32521,Hamlet,47,1.1.82,MARCELLUS,"Good now, sit down, and tell me, he that knows,"
32522,Hamlet,47,1.1.83,MARCELLUS,Why this same strict and most observant watch
32523,Hamlet,47,1.1.84,MARCELLUS,"So nightly toils the subject of the land,"
32524,Hamlet,47,1.1.85,MARCELLUS,"And why such daily cast of brazen cannon,"
32525,Hamlet,47,1.1.86,MARCELLUS,"And foreign mart for implements of war,"
32526,Hamlet,47,1.1.87,MARCELLUS,"Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task"
32527,Hamlet,47,1.1.88,MARCELLUS,"Does not divide the Sunday from the week,"
32528,Hamlet,47,1.1.89,MARCELLUS,"What might be toward, that this sweaty haste"
32529,Hamlet,47,1.1.90,MARCELLUS,Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day:
32530,Hamlet,47,1.1.91,MARCELLUS,Who is't that can inform me?
32531,Hamlet,48,1.1.92,HORATIO,"That can I,"
32532,Hamlet,48,1.1.93,HORATIO,"At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king,"
32533,Hamlet,48,1.1.94,HORATIO,"Whose image even but now appear'd to us,"
32534,Hamlet,48,1.1.95,HORATIO,"Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,"
32535,Hamlet,48,1.1.96,HORATIO,"Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,"
32536,Hamlet,48,1.1.97,HORATIO,"Dared to the combat, in which our valiant Hamlet--"
32537,Hamlet,48,1.1.98,HORATIO,For so this side of our known world esteem'd him--
32538,Hamlet,48,1.1.99,HORATIO,"Did slay this Fortinbras, who by a seal'd compact,"
32539,Hamlet,48,1.1.100,HORATIO,"Well ratified by law and heraldry,"
32540,Hamlet,48,1.1.101,HORATIO,"Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands"
32541,Hamlet,48,1.1.102,HORATIO,"Which he stood seized of, to the conqueror:"
32542,Hamlet,48,1.1.103,HORATIO,"Against the which, a moiety competent"
32543,Hamlet,48,1.1.104,HORATIO,"Was gaged by our king, which had return'd"
32544,Hamlet,48,1.1.105,HORATIO,"To the inheritance of Fortinbras,"
32545,Hamlet,48,1.1.106,HORATIO,"Had he been vanquisher, as, by the same covenant,"
32546,Hamlet,48,1.1.107,HORATIO,"And carriage of the article design'd,"
32547,Hamlet,48,1.1.108,HORATIO,"His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,"
32548,Hamlet,48,1.1.109,HORATIO,"Of unimproved mettle hot and full,"
32549,Hamlet,48,1.1.110,HORATIO,Hath in the skirts of Norway here and there
32550,Hamlet,48,1.1.111,HORATIO,"Shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,"
32551,Hamlet,48,1.1.112,HORATIO,"For food and diet, to some enterprise"
32552,Hamlet,48,1.1.113,HORATIO,"That hath a stomach in't, which is no other--"
32553,Hamlet,48,1.1.114,HORATIO,As it doth well appear unto our state--
32554,Hamlet,48,1.1.115,HORATIO,"But to recover of us, by strong hand"
32555,Hamlet,48,1.1.116,HORATIO,"And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands"
32556,Hamlet,48,1.1.117,HORATIO,"So by his father lost: and this, I take it,"
32557,Hamlet,48,1.1.118,HORATIO,"Is the main motive of our preparations,"
32558,Hamlet,48,1.1.119,HORATIO,The source of this our watch and the chief head
32559,Hamlet,48,1.1.120,HORATIO,Of this post-haste and romage in the land.
32560,Hamlet,49,1.1.121,BERNARDO,I think it be no other but e'en so:
32561,Hamlet,49,1.1.122,BERNARDO,Well may it sort that this portentous figure
32562,Hamlet,49,1.1.123,BERNARDO,"Comes armed through our watch, so like the king"
32563,Hamlet,49,1.1.124,BERNARDO,That was and is the question of these wars.
32564,Hamlet,50,1.1.125,HORATIO,A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.
32565,Hamlet,50,1.1.126,HORATIO,"In the most high and palmy state of Rome,"
32566,Hamlet,50,1.1.127,HORATIO,"A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,"
32567,Hamlet,50,1.1.128,HORATIO,The graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead
32568,Hamlet,50,1.1.129,HORATIO,Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets:
32569,Hamlet,50,1.1.130,HORATIO,"As stars with trains of fire and dews of blood,"
32570,Hamlet,50,1.1.131,HORATIO,"Disasters in the sun, and the moist star"
32571,Hamlet,50,1.1.132,HORATIO,Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands
32572,Hamlet,50,1.1.133,HORATIO,Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse:
32573,Hamlet,50,1.1.134,HORATIO,"And even the like precurse of fierce events,"
32574,Hamlet,50,1.1.135,HORATIO,As harbingers preceding still the fates
32575,Hamlet,50,1.1.136,HORATIO,"And prologue to the omen coming on,"
32576,Hamlet,50,1.1.137,HORATIO,Have heaven and earth together demonstrated
32577,Hamlet,50,1.1.138,HORATIO,Unto our climatures and countrymen.--
32578,Hamlet,50,1.1.139,HORATIO,"But soft, behold! lo, where it comes again!"
32579,Hamlet,50,,HORATIO,Re-enter Ghost
32580,Hamlet,50,1.1.140,HORATIO,"I'll cross it, though it blast me. Stay, illusion!"
32581,Hamlet,50,1.1.141,HORATIO,"If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,"
32582,Hamlet,50,1.1.142,HORATIO,Speak to me:
32583,Hamlet,50,1.1.143,HORATIO,"If there be any good thing to be done,"
32584,Hamlet,50,1.1.144,HORATIO,"That may to thee do ease and grace to me,"
32585,Hamlet,50,1.1.145,HORATIO,Speak to me:
32586,Hamlet,50,,HORATIO,Cock crows
32587,Hamlet,50,1.1.146,HORATIO,"If thou art privy to thy country's fate,"
32588,Hamlet,50,1.1.147,HORATIO,"Which, happily, foreknowing may avoid, O, speak!"
32589,Hamlet,50,1.1.148,HORATIO,Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life
32590,Hamlet,50,1.1.149,HORATIO,"Extorted treasure in the womb of earth,"
32591,Hamlet,50,1.1.150,HORATIO,"For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death,"
32592,Hamlet,50,1.1.151,HORATIO,"Speak of it: stay, and speak! Stop it, Marcellus."
32593,Hamlet,51,1.1.152,MARCELLUS,Shall I strike at it with my partisan?
32594,Hamlet,52,1.1.153,HORATIO,"Do, if it will not stand."
32595,Hamlet,53,1.1.154,BERNARDO,'Tis here!
32596,Hamlet,54,1.1.155,HORATIO,'Tis here!
32597,Hamlet,55,1.1.156,MARCELLUS,'Tis gone!
32598,Hamlet,55,,MARCELLUS,Exit Ghost
32599,Hamlet,55,1.1.157,MARCELLUS,"We do it wrong, being so majestical,"
32600,Hamlet,55,1.1.158,MARCELLUS,"To offer it the show of violence,"
32601,Hamlet,55,1.1.159,MARCELLUS,"For it is, as the air, invulnerable,"
32602,Hamlet,55,1.1.160,MARCELLUS,And our vain blows malicious mockery.
32603,Hamlet,56,1.1.161,BERNARDO,"It was about to speak, when the cock crew."
32604,Hamlet,57,1.1.162,HORATIO,And then it started like a guilty thing
32605,Hamlet,57,1.1.163,HORATIO,"Upon a fearful summons. I have heard,"
32606,Hamlet,57,1.1.164,HORATIO,"The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,"
32607,Hamlet,57,1.1.165,HORATIO,Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat
32608,Hamlet,57,1.1.166,HORATIO,"Awake the god of day, and, at his warning,"
32609,Hamlet,57,1.1.167,HORATIO,"Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,"
32610,Hamlet,57,1.1.168,HORATIO,The extravagant and erring spirit hies
32611,Hamlet,57,1.1.169,HORATIO,To his confine: and of the truth herein
32612,Hamlet,57,1.1.170,HORATIO,This present object made probation.
32613,Hamlet,58,1.1.171,MARCELLUS,It faded on the crowing of the cock.
32614,Hamlet,58,1.1.172,MARCELLUS,Some say that ever 'gainst that season comes
32615,Hamlet,58,1.1.173,MARCELLUS,"Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,"
32616,Hamlet,58,1.1.174,MARCELLUS,The bird of dawning singeth all night long:
32617,Hamlet,58,1.1.175,MARCELLUS,"And then, they say, no spirit dares stir abroad,"
32618,Hamlet,58,1.1.176,MARCELLUS,"The nights are wholesome, then no planets strike,"
32619,Hamlet,58,1.1.177,MARCELLUS,"No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,"
32620,Hamlet,58,1.1.178,MARCELLUS,So hallow'd and so gracious is the time.
32621,Hamlet,59,1.1.179,HORATIO,So have I heard and do in part believe it.
32622,Hamlet,59,1.1.180,HORATIO,"But, look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,"
32623,Hamlet,59,1.1.181,HORATIO,Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill:
32624,Hamlet,59,1.1.182,HORATIO,"Break we our watch up, and by my advice,"
32625,Hamlet,59,1.1.183,HORATIO,Let us impart what we have seen to-night
32626,Hamlet,59,1.1.184,HORATIO,"Unto young Hamlet, for, upon my life,"
32627,Hamlet,59,1.1.185,HORATIO,"This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him."
32628,Hamlet,59,1.1.186,HORATIO,"Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,"
32629,Hamlet,59,1.1.187,HORATIO,"As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?"
32630,Hamlet,60,1.1.188,MARCELLUS,"Let's do't, I pray, and I this morning know"
32631,Hamlet,60,1.1.189,MARCELLUS,Where we shall find him most conveniently.
32632,Hamlet,60,,MARCELLUS,Exeunt
32633,Hamlet,60,,MARCELLUS,SCENE II. A room of state in the castle.
32634,Hamlet,60,,MARCELLUS,"Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, HAMLET,  POLONIUS, LAERTES, VOLTIMAND, CORNELIUS, Lords, and Attendants"
32635,Hamlet,1,1.2.1,KING CLAUDIUS,Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death
32636,Hamlet,1,1.2.2,KING CLAUDIUS,"The memory be green, and that it us befitted"
32637,Hamlet,1,1.2.3,KING CLAUDIUS,To bear our hearts in grief and our whole kingdom
32638,Hamlet,1,1.2.4,KING CLAUDIUS,"To be contracted in one brow of woe,"
32639,Hamlet,1,1.2.5,KING CLAUDIUS,Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature
32640,Hamlet,1,1.2.6,KING CLAUDIUS,"That we with wisest sorrow think on him,"
32641,Hamlet,1,1.2.7,KING CLAUDIUS,Together with remembrance of ourselves.
32642,Hamlet,1,1.2.8,KING CLAUDIUS,"Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,"
32643,Hamlet,1,1.2.9,KING CLAUDIUS,"The imperial jointress to this warlike state,"
32644,Hamlet,1,1.2.10,KING CLAUDIUS,"Have we, as 'twere with a defeated joy,--"
32645,Hamlet,1,1.2.11,KING CLAUDIUS,"With an auspicious and a dropping eye,"
32646,Hamlet,1,1.2.12,KING CLAUDIUS,"With mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage,"
32647,Hamlet,1,1.2.13,KING CLAUDIUS,"In equal scale weighing delight and dole,--"
32648,Hamlet,1,1.2.14,KING CLAUDIUS,Taken to wife: nor have we herein barr'd
32649,Hamlet,1,1.2.15,KING CLAUDIUS,"Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone"
32650,Hamlet,1,1.2.16,KING CLAUDIUS,"With this affair along. For all, our thanks."
32651,Hamlet,1,1.2.17,KING CLAUDIUS,"Now follows, that you know, young Fortinbras,"
32652,Hamlet,1,1.2.18,KING CLAUDIUS,"Holding a weak supposal of our worth,"
32653,Hamlet,1,1.2.19,KING CLAUDIUS,Or thinking by our late dear brother's death
32654,Hamlet,1,1.2.20,KING CLAUDIUS,"Our state to be disjoint and out of frame,"
32655,Hamlet,1,1.2.21,KING CLAUDIUS,"Colleagued with the dream of his advantage,"
32656,Hamlet,1,1.2.22,KING CLAUDIUS,"He hath not fail'd to pester us with message,"
32657,Hamlet,1,1.2.23,KING CLAUDIUS,Importing the surrender of those lands
32658,Hamlet,1,1.2.24,KING CLAUDIUS,"Lost by his father, with all bonds of law,"
32659,Hamlet,1,1.2.25,KING CLAUDIUS,To our most valiant brother. So much for him.
32660,Hamlet,1,1.2.26,KING CLAUDIUS,Now for ourself and for this time of meeting:
32661,Hamlet,1,1.2.27,KING CLAUDIUS,Thus much the business is: we have here writ
32662,Hamlet,1,1.2.28,KING CLAUDIUS,"To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras,--"
32663,Hamlet,1,1.2.29,KING CLAUDIUS,"Who, impotent and bed-rid, scarcely hears"
32664,Hamlet,1,1.2.30,KING CLAUDIUS,"Of this his nephew's purpose,--to suppress"
32665,Hamlet,1,1.2.31,KING CLAUDIUS,"His further gait herein, in that the levies,"
32666,Hamlet,1,1.2.32,KING CLAUDIUS,"The lists and full proportions, are all made"
32667,Hamlet,1,1.2.33,KING CLAUDIUS,Out of his subject: and we here dispatch
32668,Hamlet,1,1.2.34,KING CLAUDIUS,"You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltimand,"
32669,Hamlet,1,1.2.35,KING CLAUDIUS,"For bearers of this greeting to old Norway,"
32670,Hamlet,1,1.2.36,KING CLAUDIUS,Giving to you no further personal power
32671,Hamlet,1,1.2.37,KING CLAUDIUS,"To business with the king, more than the scope"
32672,Hamlet,1,1.2.38,KING CLAUDIUS,Of these delated articles allow.
32673,Hamlet,1,1.2.39,KING CLAUDIUS,"Farewell, and let your haste commend your duty."
32674,Hamlet,3,1.2.40,VOLTIMAND,In that and all things will we show our duty.
32675,Hamlet,4,1.2.41,KING CLAUDIUS,We doubt it nothing: heartily farewell.
32676,Hamlet,4,,KING CLAUDIUS,Exeunt VOLTIMAND and CORNELIUS
32677,Hamlet,4,1.2.42,KING CLAUDIUS,"And now, Laertes, what's the news with you?"
32678,Hamlet,4,1.2.43,KING CLAUDIUS,"You told us of some suit, what is't, Laertes?"
32679,Hamlet,4,1.2.44,KING CLAUDIUS,"You cannot speak of reason to the Dane,"
32680,Hamlet,4,1.2.45,KING CLAUDIUS,"And loose your voice: what wouldst thou beg, Laertes,"
32681,Hamlet,4,1.2.46,KING CLAUDIUS,"That shall not be my offer, not thy asking?"
32682,Hamlet,4,1.2.47,KING CLAUDIUS,"The head is not more native to the heart,"
32683,Hamlet,4,1.2.48,KING CLAUDIUS,"The hand more instrumental to the mouth,"
32684,Hamlet,4,1.2.49,KING CLAUDIUS,Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father.
32685,Hamlet,4,1.2.50,KING CLAUDIUS,"What wouldst thou have, Laertes?"
32686,Hamlet,5,1.2.51,LAERTES,"My dread lord,"
32687,Hamlet,5,1.2.52,LAERTES,"Your leave and favour to return to France,"
32688,Hamlet,5,1.2.53,LAERTES,"From whence though willingly I came to Denmark,"
32689,Hamlet,5,1.2.54,LAERTES,"To show my duty in your coronation,"
32690,Hamlet,5,1.2.55,LAERTES,"Yet now, I must confess, that duty done,"
32691,Hamlet,5,1.2.56,LAERTES,My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France
32692,Hamlet,5,1.2.57,LAERTES,And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.
32693,Hamlet,6,1.2.58,KING CLAUDIUS,Have you your father's leave? What says Polonius?
32694,Hamlet,7,1.2.59,LORD POLONIUS,"He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave"
32695,Hamlet,7,1.2.60,LORD POLONIUS,"By laboursome petition, and at last"
32696,Hamlet,7,1.2.61,LORD POLONIUS,Upon his will I seal'd my hard consent:
32697,Hamlet,7,1.2.62,LORD POLONIUS,"I do beseech you, give him leave to go."
32698,Hamlet,8,1.2.63,KING CLAUDIUS,"Take thy fair hour, Laertes, time be thine,"
32699,Hamlet,8,1.2.64,KING CLAUDIUS,And thy best graces spend it at thy will!
32700,Hamlet,8,1.2.65,KING CLAUDIUS,"But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son,--"
32701,Hamlet,9,1.2.66,HAMLET,"[Aside]  A little more than kin, and less than kind."
32702,Hamlet,10,1.2.67,KING CLAUDIUS,How is it that the clouds still hang on you?
32703,Hamlet,11,1.2.68,HAMLET,"Not so, my lord, I am too much i' the sun."
32704,Hamlet,12,1.2.69,QUEEN GERTRUDE,"Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off,"
32705,Hamlet,12,1.2.70,QUEEN GERTRUDE,And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.
32706,Hamlet,12,1.2.71,QUEEN GERTRUDE,Do not for ever with thy vailed lids
32707,Hamlet,12,1.2.72,QUEEN GERTRUDE,Seek for thy noble father in the dust:
32708,Hamlet,12,1.2.73,QUEEN GERTRUDE,"Thou know'st 'tis common, all that lives must die,"
32709,Hamlet,12,1.2.74,QUEEN GERTRUDE,Passing through nature to eternity.
32710,Hamlet,13,1.2.75,HAMLET,"Ay, madam, it is common."
32711,Hamlet,14,1.2.76,QUEEN GERTRUDE,"If it be,"
32712,Hamlet,14,1.2.77,QUEEN GERTRUDE,Why seems it so particular with thee?
32713,Hamlet,15,1.2.78,HAMLET,"Seems, madam! nay it is, I know not 'seems.'"
32714,Hamlet,15,1.2.79,HAMLET,"'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,"
32715,Hamlet,15,1.2.80,HAMLET,"Nor customary suits of solemn black,"
32716,Hamlet,15,1.2.81,HAMLET,"Nor windy suspiration of forced breath,"
32717,Hamlet,15,1.2.82,HAMLET,"No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,"
32718,Hamlet,15,1.2.83,HAMLET,"Nor the dejected 'havior of the visage,"
32719,Hamlet,15,1.2.84,HAMLET,"Together with all forms, moods, shapes of grief,"
32720,Hamlet,15,1.2.85,HAMLET,"That can denote me truly: these indeed seem,"
32721,Hamlet,15,1.2.86,HAMLET,For they are actions that a man might play:
32722,Hamlet,15,1.2.87,HAMLET,"But I have that within which passeth show,"
32723,Hamlet,15,1.2.88,HAMLET,These but the trappings and the suits of woe.
32724,Hamlet,16,1.2.89,KING CLAUDIUS,"'Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet,"
32725,Hamlet,16,1.2.90,KING CLAUDIUS,To give these mourning duties to your father:
32726,Hamlet,16,1.2.91,KING CLAUDIUS,"But, you must know, your father lost a father,"
32727,Hamlet,16,1.2.92,KING CLAUDIUS,"That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound"
32728,Hamlet,16,1.2.93,KING CLAUDIUS,In filial obligation for some term
32729,Hamlet,16,1.2.94,KING CLAUDIUS,To do obsequious sorrow: but to persever
32730,Hamlet,16,1.2.95,KING CLAUDIUS,In obstinate condolement is a course
32731,Hamlet,16,1.2.96,KING CLAUDIUS,"Of impious stubbornness, 'tis unmanly grief,"
32732,Hamlet,16,1.2.97,KING CLAUDIUS,"It shows a will most incorrect to heaven,"
32733,Hamlet,16,1.2.98,KING CLAUDIUS,"A heart unfortified, a mind impatient,"
32734,Hamlet,16,1.2.99,KING CLAUDIUS,An understanding simple and unschool'd:
32735,Hamlet,16,1.2.100,KING CLAUDIUS,For what we know must be and is as common
32736,Hamlet,16,1.2.101,KING CLAUDIUS,"As any the most vulgar thing to sense,"
32737,Hamlet,16,1.2.102,KING CLAUDIUS,Why should we in our peevish opposition
32738,Hamlet,16,1.2.103,KING CLAUDIUS,"Take it to heart? Fie! 'tis a fault to heaven,"
32739,Hamlet,16,1.2.104,KING CLAUDIUS,"A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,"
32740,Hamlet,16,1.2.105,KING CLAUDIUS,To reason most absurd: whose common theme
32741,Hamlet,16,1.2.106,KING CLAUDIUS,"Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried,"
32742,Hamlet,16,1.2.107,KING CLAUDIUS,"From the first corse till he that died to-day,"
32743,Hamlet,16,1.2.108,KING CLAUDIUS,"'This must be so.' We pray you, throw to earth"
32744,Hamlet,16,1.2.109,KING CLAUDIUS,"This unprevailing woe, and think of us"
32745,Hamlet,16,1.2.110,KING CLAUDIUS,"As of a father: for let the world take note,"
32746,Hamlet,16,1.2.111,KING CLAUDIUS,"You are the most immediate to our throne,"
32747,Hamlet,16,1.2.112,KING CLAUDIUS,And with no less nobility of love
32748,Hamlet,16,1.2.113,KING CLAUDIUS,"Than that which dearest father bears his son,"
32749,Hamlet,16,1.2.114,KING CLAUDIUS,Do I impart toward you. For your intent
32750,Hamlet,16,1.2.115,KING CLAUDIUS,"In going back to school in Wittenberg,"
32751,Hamlet,16,1.2.116,KING CLAUDIUS,It is most retrograde to our desire:
32752,Hamlet,16,1.2.117,KING CLAUDIUS,"And we beseech you, bend you to remain"
32753,Hamlet,16,1.2.118,KING CLAUDIUS,"Here, in the cheer and comfort of our eye,"
32754,Hamlet,16,1.2.119,KING CLAUDIUS,"Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son."
32755,Hamlet,17,1.2.120,QUEEN GERTRUDE,"Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet:"
32756,Hamlet,17,1.2.121,QUEEN GERTRUDE,"I pray thee, stay with us, go not to Wittenberg."
32757,Hamlet,18,1.2.122,HAMLET,"I shall in all my best obey you, madam."
32758,Hamlet,19,1.2.123,KING CLAUDIUS,"Why, 'tis a loving and a fair reply:"
32759,Hamlet,19,1.2.124,KING CLAUDIUS,"Be as ourself in Denmark. Madam, come,"
32760,Hamlet,19,1.2.125,KING CLAUDIUS,This gentle and unforced accord of Hamlet
32761,Hamlet,19,1.2.126,KING CLAUDIUS,"Sits smiling to my heart: in grace whereof,"
32762,Hamlet,19,1.2.127,KING CLAUDIUS,"No jocund health that Denmark drinks to-day,"
32763,Hamlet,19,1.2.128,KING CLAUDIUS,"But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell,"
32764,Hamlet,19,1.2.129,KING CLAUDIUS,"And the king's rouse the heavens all bruit again,"
32765,Hamlet,19,1.2.130,KING CLAUDIUS,Re-speaking earthly thunder. Come away.
32766,Hamlet,19,,KING CLAUDIUS,Exeunt all but HAMLET
32767,Hamlet,20,1.2.131,HAMLET,"O, that this too too solid flesh would melt"
32768,Hamlet,20,1.2.132,HAMLET,Thaw and resolve itself into a dew!
32769,Hamlet,20,1.2.133,HAMLET,Or that the Everlasting had not fix'd
32770,Hamlet,20,1.2.134,HAMLET,His canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O God! God!
32771,Hamlet,20,1.2.135,HAMLET,"How weary, stale, flat and unprofitable,"
32772,Hamlet,20,1.2.136,HAMLET,Seem to me all the uses of this world!
32773,Hamlet,20,1.2.137,HAMLET,"Fie on't! ah fie! 'tis an unweeded garden,"
32774,Hamlet,20,1.2.138,HAMLET,"That grows to seed, things rank and gross in nature"
32775,Hamlet,20,1.2.139,HAMLET,Possess it merely. That it should come to this!
32776,Hamlet,20,1.2.140,HAMLET,"But two months dead: nay, not so much, not two:"
32777,Hamlet,20,1.2.141,HAMLET,"So excellent a king, that was, to this,"
32778,Hamlet,20,1.2.142,HAMLET,"Hyperion to a satyr, so loving to my mother"
32779,Hamlet,20,1.2.143,HAMLET,That he might not beteem the winds of heaven
32780,Hamlet,20,1.2.144,HAMLET,Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth!
32781,Hamlet,20,1.2.145,HAMLET,"Must I remember? why, she would hang on him,"
32782,Hamlet,20,1.2.146,HAMLET,As if increase of appetite had grown
32783,Hamlet,20,1.2.147,HAMLET,"By what it fed on: and yet, within a month--"
32784,Hamlet,20,1.2.148,HAMLET,"Let me not think on't--Frailty, thy name is woman!--"
32785,Hamlet,20,1.2.149,HAMLET,"A little month, or ere those shoes were old"
32786,Hamlet,20,1.2.150,HAMLET,"With which she follow'd my poor father's body,"
32787,Hamlet,20,1.2.151,HAMLET,"Like Niobe, all tears:--why she, even she--"
32788,Hamlet,20,1.2.152,HAMLET,"O, God! a beast, that wants discourse of reason,"
32789,Hamlet,20,1.2.153,HAMLET,"Would have mourn'd longer--married with my uncle,"
32790,Hamlet,20,1.2.154,HAMLET,"My father's brother, but no more like my father"
32791,Hamlet,20,1.2.155,HAMLET,Than I to Hercules: within a month:
32792,Hamlet,20,1.2.156,HAMLET,Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears
32793,Hamlet,20,1.2.157,HAMLET,"Had left the flushing in her galled eyes,"
32794,Hamlet,20,1.2.158,HAMLET,"She married. O, most wicked speed, to post"
32795,Hamlet,20,1.2.159,HAMLET,With such dexterity to incestuous sheets!
32796,Hamlet,20,1.2.160,HAMLET,It is not nor it cannot come to good:
32797,Hamlet,20,1.2.161,HAMLET,"But break, my heart, for I must hold my tongue."
32798,Hamlet,20,,HAMLET,"Enter HORATIO, MARCELLUS, and BERNARDO"
32799,Hamlet,21,1.2.162,HORATIO,Hail to your lordship!
32800,Hamlet,22,1.2.163,HAMLET,I am glad to see you well:
32801,Hamlet,22,1.2.164,HAMLET,"Horatio,--or I do forget myself."
32802,Hamlet,23,1.2.165,HORATIO,"The same, my lord, and your poor servant ever."
32803,Hamlet,24,1.2.166,HAMLET,"Sir, my good friend, I'll change that name with you:"
32804,Hamlet,24,1.2.167,HAMLET,"And what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio? Marcellus?"
32805,Hamlet,25,1.2.168,MARCELLUS,My good lord--
32806,Hamlet,26,1.2.169,HAMLET,"I am very glad to see you. Good even, sir."
32807,Hamlet,26,1.2.170,HAMLET,"But what, in faith, make you from Wittenberg?"
32808,Hamlet,27,1.2.171,HORATIO,"A truant disposition, good my lord."
32809,Hamlet,28,1.2.172,HAMLET,"I would not hear your enemy say so,"
32810,Hamlet,28,1.2.173,HAMLET,"Nor shall you do mine ear that violence,"
32811,Hamlet,28,1.2.174,HAMLET,To make it truster of your own report
32812,Hamlet,28,1.2.175,HAMLET,Against yourself: I know you are no truant.
32813,Hamlet,28,1.2.176,HAMLET,But what is your affair in Elsinore?
32814,Hamlet,28,1.2.177,HAMLET,We'll teach you to drink deep ere you depart.
32815,Hamlet,29,1.2.178,HORATIO,"My lord, I came to see your father's funeral."
32816,Hamlet,30,1.2.179,HAMLET,"I pray thee, do not mock me, fellow-student,"
32817,Hamlet,30,1.2.180,HAMLET,I think it was to see my mother's wedding.
32818,Hamlet,31,1.2.181,HORATIO,"Indeed, my lord, it follow'd hard upon."
32819,Hamlet,32,1.2.182,HAMLET,"Thrift, thrift, Horatio! the funeral baked meats"
32820,Hamlet,32,1.2.183,HAMLET,Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.
32821,Hamlet,32,1.2.184,HAMLET,Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven
32822,Hamlet,32,1.2.185,HAMLET,"Or ever I had seen that day, Horatio!"
32823,Hamlet,32,1.2.186,HAMLET,My father!--methinks I see my father.
32824,Hamlet,33,1.2.187,HORATIO,"Where, my lord?"
32825,Hamlet,34,1.2.188,HAMLET,"In my mind's eye, Horatio."
32826,Hamlet,35,1.2.189,HORATIO,"I saw him once, he was a goodly king."
32827,Hamlet,36,1.2.190,HAMLET,"He was a man, take him for all in all,"
32828,Hamlet,36,1.2.191,HAMLET,I shall not look upon his like again.
32829,Hamlet,37,1.2.192,HORATIO,"My lord, I think I saw him yesternight."
32830,Hamlet,38,1.2.193,HAMLET,Saw? who?
32831,Hamlet,39,1.2.194,HORATIO,"My lord, the king your father."
32832,Hamlet,40,1.2.195,HAMLET,The king my father!
32833,Hamlet,41,1.2.196,HORATIO,Season your admiration for awhile
32834,Hamlet,41,1.2.197,HORATIO,"With an attent ear, till I may deliver,"
32835,Hamlet,41,1.2.198,HORATIO,"Upon the witness of these gentlemen,"
32836,Hamlet,41,1.2.199,HORATIO,This marvel to you.
32837,Hamlet,42,1.2.200,HAMLET,"For God's love, let me hear."
32838,Hamlet,43,1.2.201,HORATIO,"Two nights together had these gentlemen,"
32839,Hamlet,43,1.2.202,HORATIO,"Marcellus and Bernardo, on their watch,"
32840,Hamlet,43,1.2.203,HORATIO,"In the dead vast and middle of the night,"
32841,Hamlet,43,1.2.204,HORATIO,"Been thus encounter'd. A figure like your father,"
32842,Hamlet,43,1.2.205,HORATIO,"Armed at point exactly, cap-a-pe,"
32843,Hamlet,43,1.2.206,HORATIO,"Appears before them, and with solemn march"
32844,Hamlet,43,1.2.207,HORATIO,Goes slow and stately by them: thrice he walk'd
32845,Hamlet,43,1.2.208,HORATIO,"By their oppress'd and fear-surprised eyes,"
32846,Hamlet,43,1.2.209,HORATIO,"Within his truncheon's length, whilst they, distilled"
32847,Hamlet,43,1.2.210,HORATIO,"Almost to jelly with the act of fear,"
32848,Hamlet,43,1.2.211,HORATIO,Stand dumb and speak not to him. This to me
32849,Hamlet,43,1.2.212,HORATIO,"In dreadful secrecy impart they did,"
32850,Hamlet,43,1.2.213,HORATIO,"And I with them the third night kept the watch,"
32851,Hamlet,43,1.2.214,HORATIO,"Where, as they had deliver'd, both in time,"
32852,Hamlet,43,1.2.215,HORATIO,"Form of the thing, each word made true and good,"
32853,Hamlet,43,1.2.216,HORATIO,"The apparition comes: I knew your father,"
32854,Hamlet,43,1.2.217,HORATIO,These hands are not more like.
32855,Hamlet,44,1.2.218,HAMLET,But where was this?
32856,Hamlet,45,1.2.219,MARCELLUS,"My lord, upon the platform where we watch'd."
32857,Hamlet,46,1.2.220,HAMLET,Did you not speak to it?
32858,Hamlet,47,1.2.221,HORATIO,"My lord, I did,"
32859,Hamlet,47,1.2.222,HORATIO,But answer made it none: yet once methought
32860,Hamlet,47,1.2.223,HORATIO,It lifted up its head and did address
32861,Hamlet,47,1.2.224,HORATIO,"Itself to motion, like as it would speak,"
32862,Hamlet,47,1.2.225,HORATIO,"But even then the morning cock crew loud,"
32863,Hamlet,47,1.2.226,HORATIO,"And at the sound it shrunk in haste away,"
32864,Hamlet,47,1.2.227,HORATIO,And vanish'd from our sight.
32865,Hamlet,48,1.2.228,HAMLET,'Tis very strange.
32866,Hamlet,49,1.2.229,HORATIO,"As I do live, my honour'd lord, 'tis true,"
32867,Hamlet,49,1.2.230,HORATIO,And we did think it writ down in our duty
32868,Hamlet,49,1.2.231,HORATIO,To let you know of it.
32869,Hamlet,50,1.2.232,HAMLET,"Indeed, indeed, sirs, but this troubles me."
32870,Hamlet,50,1.2.233,HAMLET,Hold you the watch to-night?
32871,Hamlet,52,1.2.234,BERNARDO,"We do, my lord."
32872,Hamlet,53,1.2.235,HAMLET,"Arm'd, say you?"
32873,Hamlet,55,1.2.236,BERNARDO,"Arm'd, my lord."
32874,Hamlet,56,1.2.237,HAMLET,From top to toe?
32875,Hamlet,58,1.2.238,BERNARDO,"My lord, from head to foot."
32876,Hamlet,59,1.2.239,HAMLET,Then saw you not his face?
32877,Hamlet,60,1.2.240,HORATIO,"O, yes, my lord, he wore his beaver up."
32878,Hamlet,61,1.2.241,HAMLET,"What, look'd he frowningly?"
32879,Hamlet,62,1.2.242,HORATIO,A countenance more in sorrow than in anger.
32880,Hamlet,63,1.2.243,HAMLET,Pale or red?
32881,Hamlet,64,1.2.244,HORATIO,"Nay, very pale."
32882,Hamlet,65,1.2.245,HAMLET,And fix'd his eyes upon you?
32883,Hamlet,66,1.2.246,HORATIO,Most constantly.
32884,Hamlet,67,1.2.247,HAMLET,I would I had been there.
32885,Hamlet,68,1.2.248,HORATIO,It would have much amazed you.
32886,Hamlet,69,1.2.249,HAMLET,"Very like, very like. Stay'd it long?"
32887,Hamlet,70,1.2.250,HORATIO,While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred.
32888,Hamlet,72,1.2.251,BERNARDO,"Longer, longer."
32889,Hamlet,73,1.2.252,HORATIO,Not when I saw't.
32890,Hamlet,74,1.2.253,HAMLET,His beard was grizzled--no?
32891,Hamlet,75,1.2.254,HORATIO,"It was, as I have seen it in his life,"
32892,Hamlet,75,1.2.255,HORATIO,A sable silver'd.
32893,Hamlet,76,1.2.256,HAMLET,"I will watch to-night,"
32894,Hamlet,76,1.2.257,HAMLET,Perchance 'twill walk again.
32895,Hamlet,77,1.2.258,HORATIO,I warrant it will.
32896,Hamlet,78,1.2.259,HAMLET,"If it assume my noble father's person,"
32897,Hamlet,78,1.2.260,HAMLET,"I'll speak to it, though hell itself should gape"
32898,Hamlet,78,1.2.261,HAMLET,"And bid me hold my peace. I pray you all,"
32899,Hamlet,78,1.2.262,HAMLET,"If you have hitherto conceal'd this sight,"
32900,Hamlet,78,1.2.263,HAMLET,"Let it be tenable in your silence still,"
32901,Hamlet,78,1.2.264,HAMLET,"And whatsoever else shall hap to-night,"
32902,Hamlet,78,1.2.265,HAMLET,"Give it an understanding, but no tongue:"
32903,Hamlet,78,1.2.266,HAMLET,"I will requite your loves. So, fare you well:"
32904,Hamlet,78,1.2.267,HAMLET,"Upon the platform, 'twixt eleven and twelve,"
32905,Hamlet,78,1.2.268,HAMLET,I'll visit you.
32906,Hamlet,79,1.2.269,All,Our duty to your honour.
32907,Hamlet,80,1.2.270,HAMLET,"Your loves, as mine to you: farewell."
32908,Hamlet,80,,HAMLET,Exeunt all but HAMLET
32909,Hamlet,80,1.2.271,HAMLET,"My father's spirit in arms! all is not well,"
32910,Hamlet,80,1.2.272,HAMLET,I doubt some foul play: would the night were come!
32911,Hamlet,80,1.2.273,HAMLET,"Till then sit still, my soul: foul deeds will rise,"
32912,Hamlet,80,1.2.274,HAMLET,"Though all the earth o'erwhelm them, to men's eyes."
32913,Hamlet,80,,HAMLET,Exit
32914,Hamlet,80,,HAMLET,SCENE III. A room in Polonius' house.
32915,Hamlet,80,,HAMLET,Enter LAERTES and OPHELIA
32916,Hamlet,1,1.3.1,LAERTES,My necessaries are embark'd: farewell:
32917,Hamlet,1,1.3.2,LAERTES,"And, sister, as the winds give benefit"
32918,Hamlet,1,1.3.3,LAERTES,"And convoy is assistant, do not sleep,"
32919,Hamlet,1,1.3.4,LAERTES,But let me hear from you.
32920,Hamlet,2,1.3.5,OPHELIA,Do you doubt that?
32921,Hamlet,3,1.3.6,LAERTES,"For Hamlet and the trifling of his favour,"
32922,Hamlet,3,1.3.7,LAERTES,"Hold it a fashion and a toy in blood,"
32923,Hamlet,3,1.3.8,LAERTES,"A violet in the youth of primy nature,"
32924,Hamlet,3,1.3.9,LAERTES,"Forward, not permanent, sweet, not lasting,"
32925,Hamlet,3,1.3.10,LAERTES,"The perfume and suppliance of a minute, No more."
32926,Hamlet,4,1.3.11,OPHELIA,No more but so?
32927,Hamlet,5,1.3.12,LAERTES,"Think it no more,"
32928,Hamlet,5,1.3.13,LAERTES,"For nature, crescent, does not grow alone"
32929,Hamlet,5,1.3.14,LAERTES,"In thews and bulk, but, as this temple waxes,"
32930,Hamlet,5,1.3.15,LAERTES,The inward service of the mind and soul
32931,Hamlet,5,1.3.16,LAERTES,"Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now,"
32932,Hamlet,5,1.3.17,LAERTES,And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch
32933,Hamlet,5,1.3.18,LAERTES,"The virtue of his will: but you must fear,"
32934,Hamlet,5,1.3.19,LAERTES,"His greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own,"
32935,Hamlet,5,1.3.20,LAERTES,For he himself is subject to his birth:
32936,Hamlet,5,1.3.21,LAERTES,"He may not, as unvalued persons do,"
32937,Hamlet,5,1.3.22,LAERTES,"Carve for himself, for on his choice depends"
32938,Hamlet,5,1.3.23,LAERTES,"The safety and health of this whole state,"
32939,Hamlet,5,1.3.24,LAERTES,And therefore must his choice be circumscribed
32940,Hamlet,5,1.3.25,LAERTES,Unto the voice and yielding of that body
32941,Hamlet,5,1.3.26,LAERTES,"Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,"
32942,Hamlet,5,1.3.27,LAERTES,It fits your wisdom so far to believe it
32943,Hamlet,5,1.3.28,LAERTES,As he in his particular act and place
32944,Hamlet,5,1.3.29,LAERTES,"May give his saying deed, which is no further"
32945,Hamlet,5,1.3.30,LAERTES,Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal.
32946,Hamlet,5,1.3.31,LAERTES,"Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain,"
32947,Hamlet,5,1.3.32,LAERTES,"If with too credent ear you list his songs,"
32948,Hamlet,5,1.3.33,LAERTES,"Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open"
32949,Hamlet,5,1.3.34,LAERTES,To his unmaster'd importunity.
32950,Hamlet,5,1.3.35,LAERTES,"Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister,"
32951,Hamlet,5,1.3.36,LAERTES,"And keep you in the rear of your affection,"
32952,Hamlet,5,1.3.37,LAERTES,Out of the shot and danger of desire.
32953,Hamlet,5,1.3.38,LAERTES,"The chariest maid is prodigal enough,"
32954,Hamlet,5,1.3.39,LAERTES,If she unmask her beauty to the moon:
32955,Hamlet,5,1.3.40,LAERTES,Virtue itself 'scapes not calumnious strokes:
32956,Hamlet,5,1.3.41,LAERTES,"The canker galls the infants of the spring,"
32957,Hamlet,5,1.3.42,LAERTES,"Too oft before their buttons be disclosed,"
32958,Hamlet,5,1.3.43,LAERTES,And in the morn and liquid dew of youth
32959,Hamlet,5,1.3.44,LAERTES,Contagious blastments are most imminent.
32960,Hamlet,5,1.3.45,LAERTES,"Be wary then, best safety lies in fear:"
32961,Hamlet,5,1.3.46,LAERTES,"Youth to itself rebels, though none else near."
32962,Hamlet,6,1.3.47,OPHELIA,"I shall the effect of this good lesson keep,"
32963,Hamlet,6,1.3.48,OPHELIA,"As watchman to my heart. But, good my brother,"
32964,Hamlet,6,1.3.49,OPHELIA,"Do not, as some ungracious pastors do,"
32965,Hamlet,6,1.3.50,OPHELIA,"Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven,"
32966,Hamlet,6,1.3.51,OPHELIA,"Whiles, like a puff'd and reckless libertine,"
32967,Hamlet,6,1.3.52,OPHELIA,"Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads,"
32968,Hamlet,6,1.3.53,OPHELIA,And recks not his own rede.
32969,Hamlet,7,1.3.54,LAERTES,"O, fear me not."
32970,Hamlet,7,1.3.55,LAERTES,I stay too long: but here my father comes.
32971,Hamlet,7,,LAERTES,Enter POLONIUS
32972,Hamlet,7,1.3.56,LAERTES,"A double blessing is a double grace,"
32973,Hamlet,7,1.3.57,LAERTES,Occasion smiles upon a second leave.
32974,Hamlet,8,1.3.58,LORD POLONIUS,"Yet here, Laertes! aboard, aboard, for shame!"
32975,Hamlet,8,1.3.59,LORD POLONIUS,"The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,"
32976,Hamlet,8,1.3.60,LORD POLONIUS,"And you are stay'd for. There, my blessing with thee!"
32977,Hamlet,8,1.3.61,LORD POLONIUS,And these few precepts in thy memory
32978,Hamlet,8,1.3.62,LORD POLONIUS,"See thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,"
32979,Hamlet,8,1.3.63,LORD POLONIUS,Nor any unproportioned thought his act.
32980,Hamlet,8,1.3.64,LORD POLONIUS,"Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar."
32981,Hamlet,8,1.3.65,LORD POLONIUS,"Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,"
32982,Hamlet,8,1.3.66,LORD POLONIUS,"Grapple them to thy soul with hoops of steel,"
32983,Hamlet,8,1.3.67,LORD POLONIUS,But do not dull thy palm with entertainment
32984,Hamlet,8,1.3.68,LORD POLONIUS,"Of each new-hatch'd, unfledged comrade. Beware"
32985,Hamlet,8,1.3.69,LORD POLONIUS,"Of entrance to a quarrel, but being in,"
32986,Hamlet,8,1.3.70,LORD POLONIUS,Bear't that the opposed may beware of thee.
32987,Hamlet,8,1.3.71,LORD POLONIUS,"Give every man thy ear, but few thy voice,"
32988,Hamlet,8,1.3.72,LORD POLONIUS,"Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment."
32989,Hamlet,8,1.3.73,LORD POLONIUS,"Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,"
32990,Hamlet,8,1.3.74,LORD POLONIUS,"But not express'd in fancy, rich, not gaudy,"
32991,Hamlet,8,1.3.75,LORD POLONIUS,"For the apparel oft proclaims the man,"
32992,Hamlet,8,1.3.76,LORD POLONIUS,And they in France of the best rank and station
32993,Hamlet,8,1.3.77,LORD POLONIUS,Are of a most select and generous chief in that.
32994,Hamlet,8,1.3.78,LORD POLONIUS,"Neither a borrower nor a lender be,"
32995,Hamlet,8,1.3.79,LORD POLONIUS,"For loan oft loses both itself and friend,"
32996,Hamlet,8,1.3.80,LORD POLONIUS,And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.
32997,Hamlet,8,1.3.81,LORD POLONIUS,"This above all: to thine ownself be true,"
32998,Hamlet,8,1.3.82,LORD POLONIUS,"And it must follow, as the night the day,"
32999,Hamlet,8,1.3.83,LORD POLONIUS,Thou canst not then be false to any man.
33000,Hamlet,8,1.3.84,LORD POLONIUS,Farewell: my blessing season this in thee!
33001,Hamlet,9,1.3.85,LAERTES,"Most humbly do I take my leave, my lord."
33002,Hamlet,10,1.3.86,LORD POLONIUS,"The time invites you, go, your servants tend."
33003,Hamlet,11,1.3.87,LAERTES,"Farewell, Ophelia, and remember well"
33004,Hamlet,11,1.3.88,LAERTES,What I have said to you.
33005,Hamlet,12,1.3.89,OPHELIA,"'Tis in my memory lock'd,"
33006,Hamlet,12,1.3.90,OPHELIA,And you yourself shall keep the key of it.
33007,Hamlet,13,1.3.91,LAERTES,Farewell.
33008,Hamlet,13,,LAERTES,Exit
33009,Hamlet,14,1.3.92,LORD POLONIUS,"What is't, Ophelia, be hath said to you?"
33010,Hamlet,15,1.3.93,OPHELIA,"So please you, something touching the Lord Hamlet."
33011,Hamlet,16,1.3.94,LORD POLONIUS,"Marry, well bethought:"
33012,Hamlet,16,1.3.95,LORD POLONIUS,"'Tis told me, he hath very oft of late"
33013,Hamlet,16,1.3.96,LORD POLONIUS,"Given private time to you, and you yourself"
33014,Hamlet,16,1.3.97,LORD POLONIUS,Have of your audience been most free and bounteous:
33015,Hamlet,16,1.3.98,LORD POLONIUS,"If it be so, as so 'tis put on me,"
33016,Hamlet,16,1.3.99,LORD POLONIUS,"And that in way of caution, I must tell you,"
33017,Hamlet,16,1.3.100,LORD POLONIUS,You do not understand yourself so clearly
33018,Hamlet,16,1.3.101,LORD POLONIUS,As it behoves my daughter and your honour.
33019,Hamlet,16,1.3.102,LORD POLONIUS,What is between you? give me up the truth.
33020,Hamlet,17,1.3.103,OPHELIA,"He hath, my lord, of late made many tenders"
33021,Hamlet,17,1.3.104,OPHELIA,Of his affection to me.
33022,Hamlet,18,1.3.105,LORD POLONIUS,"Affection! pooh! you speak like a green girl,"
33023,Hamlet,18,1.3.106,LORD POLONIUS,Unsifted in such perilous circumstance.
33024,Hamlet,18,1.3.107,LORD POLONIUS,"Do you believe his tenders, as you call them?"
33025,Hamlet,19,1.3.108,OPHELIA,"I do not know, my lord, what I should think."
33026,Hamlet,20,1.3.109,LORD POLONIUS,"Marry, I'll teach you: think yourself a baby,"
33027,Hamlet,20,1.3.110,LORD POLONIUS,"That you have ta'en these tenders for true pay,"
33028,Hamlet,20,1.3.111,LORD POLONIUS,"Which are not sterling. Tender yourself more dearly,"
33029,Hamlet,20,1.3.112,LORD POLONIUS,"Or--not to crack the wind of the poor phrase,"
33030,Hamlet,20,1.3.113,LORD POLONIUS,Running it thus--you'll tender me a fool.
33031,Hamlet,21,1.3.114,OPHELIA,"My lord, he hath importuned me with love"
33032,Hamlet,21,1.3.115,OPHELIA,In honourable fashion.
33033,Hamlet,22,1.3.116,LORD POLONIUS,"Ay, fashion you may call it, go to, go to."
33034,Hamlet,23,1.3.117,OPHELIA,"And hath given countenance to his speech, my lord,"
33035,Hamlet,23,1.3.118,OPHELIA,With almost all the holy vows of heaven.
33036,Hamlet,24,1.3.119,LORD POLONIUS,"Ay, springes to catch woodcocks. I do know,"
33037,Hamlet,24,1.3.120,LORD POLONIUS,"When the blood burns, how prodigal the soul"
33038,Hamlet,24,1.3.121,LORD POLONIUS,"Lends the tongue vows: these blazes, daughter,"
33039,Hamlet,24,1.3.122,LORD POLONIUS,"Giving more light than heat, extinct in both,"
33040,Hamlet,24,1.3.123,LORD POLONIUS,"Even in their promise, as it is a-making,"
33041,Hamlet,24,1.3.124,LORD POLONIUS,You must not take for fire. From this time
33042,Hamlet,24,1.3.125,LORD POLONIUS,"Be somewhat scanter of your maiden presence,"
33043,Hamlet,24,1.3.126,LORD POLONIUS,Set your entreatments at a higher rate
33044,Hamlet,24,1.3.127,LORD POLONIUS,"Than a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet,"
33045,Hamlet,24,1.3.128,LORD POLONIUS,"Believe so much in him, that he is young"
33046,Hamlet,24,1.3.129,LORD POLONIUS,And with a larger tether may he walk
33047,Hamlet,24,1.3.130,LORD POLONIUS,"Than may be given you: in few, Ophelia,"
33048,Hamlet,24,1.3.131,LORD POLONIUS,"Do not believe his vows, for they are brokers,"
33049,Hamlet,24,1.3.132,LORD POLONIUS,"Not of that dye which their investments show,"
33050,Hamlet,24,1.3.133,LORD POLONIUS,"But mere implorators of unholy suits,"
33051,Hamlet,24,1.3.134,LORD POLONIUS,"Breathing like sanctified and pious bawds,"
33052,Hamlet,24,1.3.135,LORD POLONIUS,The better to beguile. This is for all:
33053,Hamlet,24,1.3.136,LORD POLONIUS,"I would not, in plain terms, from this time forth,"
33054,Hamlet,24,1.3.137,LORD POLONIUS,"Have you so slander any moment leisure,"
33055,Hamlet,24,1.3.138,LORD POLONIUS,As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet.
33056,Hamlet,24,1.3.139,LORD POLONIUS,"Look to't, I charge you: come your ways."
33057,Hamlet,25,1.3.140,OPHELIA,"I shall obey, my lord."
33058,Hamlet,25,,OPHELIA,Exeunt
33059,Hamlet,25,,OPHELIA,SCENE IV. The platform.
33060,Hamlet,25,,OPHELIA,"Enter HAMLET, HORATIO, and MARCELLUS"
33061,Hamlet,1,1.4.1,HAMLET,"The air bites shrewdly, it is very cold."
33062,Hamlet,2,1.4.2,HORATIO,It is a nipping and an eager air.
33063,Hamlet,3,1.4.3,HAMLET,What hour now?
33064,Hamlet,4,1.4.4,HORATIO,I think it lacks of twelve.
33065,Hamlet,5,1.4.5,HAMLET,"No, it is struck."
33066,Hamlet,6,1.4.6,HORATIO,Indeed? I heard it not: then it draws near the season
33067,Hamlet,6,1.4.7,HORATIO,Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk.
33068,Hamlet,6,,HORATIO,"A flourish of trumpets, and ordnance shot off, within"
33069,Hamlet,6,1.4.8,HORATIO,"What does this mean, my lord?"
33070,Hamlet,7,1.4.9,HAMLET,"The king doth wake to-night and takes his rouse,"
33071,Hamlet,7,1.4.10,HAMLET,"Keeps wassail, and the swaggering up-spring reels,"
33072,Hamlet,7,1.4.11,HAMLET,"And, as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down,"
33073,Hamlet,7,1.4.12,HAMLET,The kettle-drum and trumpet thus bray out
33074,Hamlet,7,1.4.13,HAMLET,The triumph of his pledge.
33075,Hamlet,8,1.4.14,HORATIO,Is it a custom?
33076,Hamlet,9,1.4.15,HAMLET,"Ay, marry, is't:"
33077,Hamlet,9,1.4.16,HAMLET,"But to my mind, though I am native here"
33078,Hamlet,9,1.4.17,HAMLET,"And to the manner born, it is a custom"
33079,Hamlet,9,1.4.18,HAMLET,More honour'd in the breach than the observance.
33080,Hamlet,9,1.4.19,HAMLET,This heavy-headed revel east and west
33081,Hamlet,9,1.4.20,HAMLET,Makes us traduced and tax'd of other nations:
33082,Hamlet,9,1.4.21,HAMLET,"They clepe us drunkards, and with swinish phrase"
33083,Hamlet,9,1.4.22,HAMLET,"Soil our addition, and indeed it takes"
33084,Hamlet,9,1.4.23,HAMLET,"From our achievements, though perform'd at height,"
33085,Hamlet,9,1.4.24,HAMLET,The pith and marrow of our attribute.
33086,Hamlet,9,1.4.25,HAMLET,"So, oft it chances in particular men,"
33087,Hamlet,9,1.4.26,HAMLET,"That for some vicious mole of nature in them,"
33088,Hamlet,9,1.4.27,HAMLET,"As, in their birth--wherein they are not guilty,"
33089,Hamlet,9,1.4.28,HAMLET,Since nature cannot choose his origin--
33090,Hamlet,9,1.4.29,HAMLET,"By the o'ergrowth of some complexion,"
33091,Hamlet,9,1.4.30,HAMLET,"Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason,"
33092,Hamlet,9,1.4.31,HAMLET,Or by some habit that too much o'er-leavens
33093,Hamlet,9,1.4.32,HAMLET,"The form of plausive manners, that these men,"
33094,Hamlet,9,1.4.33,HAMLET,"Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect,"
33095,Hamlet,9,1.4.34,HAMLET,"Being nature's livery, or fortune's star,--"
33096,Hamlet,9,1.4.35,HAMLET,"Their virtues else--be they as pure as grace,"
33097,Hamlet,9,1.4.36,HAMLET,As infinite as man may undergo--
33098,Hamlet,9,1.4.37,HAMLET,Shall in the general censure take corruption
33099,Hamlet,9,1.4.38,HAMLET,From that particular fault: the dram of eale
33100,Hamlet,9,1.4.39,HAMLET,Doth all the noble substance of a doubt
33101,Hamlet,9,1.4.40,HAMLET,To his own scandal.
33102,Hamlet,10,1.4.41,HORATIO,"Look, my lord, it comes!"
33103,Hamlet,10,,HORATIO,Enter Ghost
33104,Hamlet,11,1.4.42,HAMLET,Angels and ministers of grace defend us!
33105,Hamlet,11,1.4.43,HAMLET,"Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn'd,"
33106,Hamlet,11,1.4.44,HAMLET,"Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell,"
33107,Hamlet,11,1.4.45,HAMLET,"Be thy intents wicked or charitable,"
33108,Hamlet,11,1.4.46,HAMLET,Thou comest in such a questionable shape
33109,Hamlet,11,1.4.47,HAMLET,"That I will speak to thee: I'll call thee Hamlet,"
33110,Hamlet,11,1.4.48,HAMLET,"King, father, royal Dane: O, answer me!"
33111,Hamlet,11,1.4.49,HAMLET,"Let me not burst in ignorance, but tell"
33112,Hamlet,11,1.4.50,HAMLET,"Why thy canonized bones, hearsed in death,"
33113,Hamlet,11,1.4.51,HAMLET,"Have burst their cerements, why the sepulchre,"
33114,Hamlet,11,1.4.52,HAMLET,"Wherein we saw thee quietly inurn'd,"
33115,Hamlet,11,1.4.53,HAMLET,"Hath oped his ponderous and marble jaws,"
33116,Hamlet,11,1.4.54,HAMLET,"To cast thee up again. What may this mean,"
33117,Hamlet,11,1.4.55,HAMLET,"That thou, dead corse, again in complete steel"
33118,Hamlet,11,1.4.56,HAMLET,"Revisit'st thus the glimpses of the moon,"
33119,Hamlet,11,1.4.57,HAMLET,"Making night hideous, and we fools of nature"
33120,Hamlet,11,1.4.58,HAMLET,So horridly to shake our disposition
33121,Hamlet,11,1.4.59,HAMLET,With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls?
33122,Hamlet,11,1.4.60,HAMLET,"Say, why is this? wherefore? what should we do?"
33123,Hamlet,11,,HAMLET,Ghost beckons HAMLET
33124,Hamlet,12,1.4.61,HORATIO,"It beckons you to go away with it,"
33125,Hamlet,12,1.4.62,HORATIO,As if it some impartment did desire
33126,Hamlet,12,1.4.63,HORATIO,To you alone.
33127,Hamlet,13,1.4.64,MARCELLUS,"Look, with what courteous action"
33128,Hamlet,13,1.4.65,MARCELLUS,It waves you to a more removed ground:
33129,Hamlet,13,1.4.66,MARCELLUS,But do not go with it.
33130,Hamlet,14,1.4.67,HORATIO,"No, by no means."
33131,Hamlet,15,1.4.68,HAMLET,"It will not speak, then I will follow it."
