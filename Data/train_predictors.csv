1,Henry IV,,,ACT I
2,Henry IV,,,SCENE I. London. The palace.
3,Henry IV,,,"Enter KING HENRY, LORD JOHN OF LANCASTER, the EARL of WESTMORELAND, SIR WALTER BLUNT, and others"
4,Henry IV,1,1.1.1,"So shaken as we are, so wan with care,"
5,Henry IV,1,1.1.2,"Find we a time for frighted peace to pant,"
6,Henry IV,1,1.1.3,And breathe short-winded accents of new broils
7,Henry IV,1,1.1.4,To be commenced in strands afar remote.
8,Henry IV,1,1.1.5,No more the thirsty entrance of this soil
9,Henry IV,1,1.1.6,"Shall daub her lips with her own children's blood,"
10,Henry IV,1,1.1.7,"Nor more shall trenching war channel her fields,"
11,Henry IV,1,1.1.8,Nor bruise her flowerets with the armed hoofs
12,Henry IV,1,1.1.9,"Of hostile paces: those opposed eyes,"
13,Henry IV,1,1.1.10,"Which, like the meteors of a troubled heaven,"
14,Henry IV,1,1.1.11,"All of one nature, of one substance bred,"
15,Henry IV,1,1.1.12,Did lately meet in the intestine shock
16,Henry IV,1,1.1.13,And furious close of civil butchery
17,Henry IV,1,1.1.14,"Shall now, in mutual well-beseeming ranks,"
18,Henry IV,1,1.1.15,March all one way and be no more opposed
19,Henry IV,1,1.1.16,"Against acquaintance, kindred and allies:"
20,Henry IV,1,1.1.17,"The edge of war, like an ill-sheathed knife,"
21,Henry IV,1,1.1.18,"No more shall cut his master. Therefore, friends,"
22,Henry IV,1,1.1.19,"As far as to the sepulchre of Christ,"
23,Henry IV,1,1.1.20,"Whose soldier now, under whose blessed cross"
24,Henry IV,1,1.1.21,"We are impressed and engaged to fight,"
25,Henry IV,1,1.1.22,"Forthwith a power of English shall we levy,"
26,Henry IV,1,1.1.23,Whose arms were moulded in their mothers' womb
27,Henry IV,1,1.1.24,To chase these pagans in those holy fields
28,Henry IV,1,1.1.25,Over whose acres walk'd those blessed feet
29,Henry IV,1,1.1.26,Which fourteen hundred years ago were nail'd
30,Henry IV,1,1.1.27,For our advantage on the bitter cross.
31,Henry IV,1,1.1.28,"But this our purpose now is twelve month old,"
32,Henry IV,1,1.1.29,And bootless 'tis to tell you we will go:
33,Henry IV,1,1.1.30,Therefore we meet not now. Then let me hear
34,Henry IV,1,1.1.31,"Of you, my gentle cousin Westmoreland,"
35,Henry IV,1,1.1.32,What yesternight our council did decree
36,Henry IV,1,1.1.33,In forwarding this dear expedience.
37,Henry IV,2,1.1.34,"My liege, this haste was hot in question,"
38,Henry IV,2,1.1.35,And many limits of the charge set down
39,Henry IV,2,1.1.36,But yesternight: when all athwart there came
40,Henry IV,2,1.1.37,"A post from Wales loaden with heavy news,"
41,Henry IV,2,1.1.38,"Whose worst was, that the noble Mortimer,"
42,Henry IV,2,1.1.39,Leading the men of Herefordshire to fight
43,Henry IV,2,1.1.40,"Against the irregular and wild Glendower,"
44,Henry IV,2,1.1.41,"Was by the rude hands of that Welshman taken,"
45,Henry IV,2,1.1.42,"A thousand of his people butchered,"
46,Henry IV,2,1.1.43,"Upon whose dead corpse there was such misuse,"
47,Henry IV,2,1.1.44,"Such beastly shameless transformation,"
48,Henry IV,2,1.1.45,By those Welshwomen done as may not be
49,Henry IV,2,1.1.46,Without much shame retold or spoken of.
50,Henry IV,3,1.1.47,It seems then that the tidings of this broil
51,Henry IV,3,1.1.48,Brake off our business for the Holy Land.
52,Henry IV,4,1.1.49,"This match'd with other did, my gracious lord,"
53,Henry IV,4,1.1.50,For more uneven and unwelcome news
54,Henry IV,4,1.1.51,Came from the north and thus it did import:
55,Henry IV,4,1.1.52,"On Holy-rood day, the gallant Hotspur there,"
56,Henry IV,4,1.1.53,"Young Harry Percy and brave Archibald,"
57,Henry IV,4,1.1.54,"That ever-valiant and approved Scot,"
58,Henry IV,4,1.1.55,"At Holmedon met,"
59,Henry IV,4,1.1.56,"Where they did spend a sad and bloody hour,"
60,Henry IV,4,1.1.57,"As by discharge of their artillery,"
61,Henry IV,4,1.1.58,"And shape of likelihood, the news was told,"
62,Henry IV,4,1.1.59,"For he that brought them, in the very heat"
63,Henry IV,4,1.1.60,"And pride of their contention did take horse,"
64,Henry IV,4,1.1.61,Uncertain of the issue any way.
65,Henry IV,5,1.1.62,"Here is a dear, a true industrious friend,"
66,Henry IV,5,1.1.63,"Sir Walter Blunt, new lighted from his horse."
67,Henry IV,5,1.1.64,Stain'd with the variation of each soil
68,Henry IV,5,1.1.65,"Betwixt that Holmedon and this seat of ours,"
69,Henry IV,5,1.1.66,And he hath brought us smooth and welcome news.
70,Henry IV,5,1.1.67,The Earl of Douglas is discomfited:
71,Henry IV,5,1.1.68,"Ten thousand bold Scots, two and twenty knights,"
72,Henry IV,5,1.1.69,Balk'd in their own blood did Sir Walter see
73,Henry IV,5,1.1.70,"On Holmedon's plains. Of prisoners, Hotspur took"
74,Henry IV,5,1.1.71,"Mordake the Earl of Fife, and eldest son"
75,Henry IV,5,1.1.72,"To beaten Douglas, and the Earl of Athol,"
76,Henry IV,5,1.1.73,"Of Murray, Angus, and Menteith:"
77,Henry IV,5,1.1.74,And is not this an honourable spoil?
78,Henry IV,5,1.1.75,"A gallant prize? ha, cousin, is it not?"
79,Henry IV,6,1.1.76,"In faith,"
80,Henry IV,6,1.1.77,It is a conquest for a prince to boast of.
81,Henry IV,7,1.1.78,"Yea, there thou makest me sad and makest me sin"
82,Henry IV,7,1.1.79,In envy that my Lord Northumberland
83,Henry IV,7,1.1.80,"Should be the father to so blest a son,"
84,Henry IV,7,1.1.81,"A son who is the theme of honour's tongue,"
85,Henry IV,7,1.1.82,"Amongst a grove, the very straightest plant,"
86,Henry IV,7,1.1.83,Who is sweet Fortune's minion and her pride:
87,Henry IV,7,1.1.84,"Whilst I, by looking on the praise of him,"
88,Henry IV,7,1.1.85,See riot and dishonour stain the brow
89,Henry IV,7,1.1.86,Of my young Harry. O that it could be proved
90,Henry IV,7,1.1.87,That some night-tripping fairy had exchanged
91,Henry IV,7,1.1.88,"In cradle-clothes our children where they lay,"
92,Henry IV,7,1.1.89,"And call'd mine Percy, his Plantagenet!"
93,Henry IV,7,1.1.90,"Then would I have his Harry, and he mine."
94,Henry IV,7,1.1.91,"But let him from my thoughts. What think you, coz,"
95,Henry IV,7,1.1.92,"Of this young Percy's pride? the prisoners,"
96,Henry IV,7,1.1.93,"Which he in this adventure hath surprised,"
97,Henry IV,7,1.1.94,"To his own use he keeps, and sends me word,"
98,Henry IV,7,1.1.95,I shall have none but Mordake Earl of Fife.
99,Henry IV,8,1.1.96,"This is his uncle's teaching, this is Worcester,"
100,Henry IV,8,1.1.97,"Malevolent to you in all aspects,"
101,Henry IV,8,1.1.98,"Which makes him prune himself, and bristle up"
102,Henry IV,8,1.1.99,The crest of youth against your dignity.
103,Henry IV,9,1.1.100,"But I have sent for him to answer this,"
104,Henry IV,9,1.1.101,And for this cause awhile we must neglect
105,Henry IV,9,1.1.102,Our holy purpose to Jerusalem.
106,Henry IV,9,1.1.103,"Cousin, on Wednesday next our council we"
107,Henry IV,9,1.1.104,"Will hold at Windsor, so inform the lords:"
108,Henry IV,9,1.1.105,"But come yourself with speed to us again,"
109,Henry IV,9,1.1.106,For more is to be said and to be done
110,Henry IV,9,1.1.107,Than out of anger can be uttered.
111,Henry IV,10,1.1.108,"I will, my liege."
112,Henry IV,10,,Exeunt
113,Henry IV,10,,SCENE II. London. An apartment of the Prince's.
114,Henry IV,10,,Enter the PRINCE OF WALES and FALSTAFF
115,Henry IV,1,1.2.1,"Now, Hal, what time of day is it, lad?"
116,Henry IV,2,1.2.2,"Thou art so fat-witted, with drinking of old sack"
117,Henry IV,2,1.2.3,and unbuttoning thee after supper and sleeping upon
118,Henry IV,2,1.2.4,"benches after noon, that thou hast forgotten to"
119,Henry IV,2,1.2.5,demand that truly which thou wouldst truly know.
120,Henry IV,2,1.2.6,What a devil hast thou to do with the time of the
121,Henry IV,2,1.2.7,day? Unless hours were cups of sack and minutes
122,Henry IV,2,1.2.8,capons and clocks the tongues of bawds and dials the
123,Henry IV,2,1.2.9,signs of leaping-houses and the blessed sun himself
124,Henry IV,2,1.2.10,"a fair hot wench in flame-coloured taffeta, I see no"
125,Henry IV,2,1.2.11,reason why thou shouldst be so superfluous to demand
126,Henry IV,2,1.2.12,the time of the day.
127,Henry IV,3,1.2.13,"Indeed, you come near me now, Hal, for we that take"
128,Henry IV,3,1.2.14,"purses go by the moon and the seven stars, and not"
129,Henry IV,3,1.2.15,"by Phoebus, he,'that wandering knight so fair.' And,"
130,Henry IV,3,1.2.16,"I prithee, sweet wag, when thou art king, as, God"
131,Henry IV,3,1.2.17,"save thy grace,--majesty I should say, for grace"
132,Henry IV,3,1.2.18,"thou wilt have none,--"
133,Henry IV,4,1.2.19,"What, none?"
134,Henry IV,5,1.2.20,"No, by my troth, not so much as will serve to"
135,Henry IV,5,1.2.21,prologue to an egg and butter.
136,Henry IV,6,1.2.22,"Well, how then? come, roundly, roundly."
137,Henry IV,7,1.2.23,"Marry, then, sweet wag, when thou art king, let not"
138,Henry IV,7,1.2.24,us that are squires of the night's body be called
139,Henry IV,7,1.2.25,thieves of the day's beauty: let us be Diana's
140,Henry IV,7,1.2.26,"foresters, gentlemen of the shade, minions of the"
141,Henry IV,7,1.2.27,"moon, and let men say we be men of good government,"
142,Henry IV,7,1.2.28,"being governed, as the sea is, by our noble and"
143,Henry IV,7,1.2.29,"chaste mistress the moon, under whose countenance we steal."
144,Henry IV,8,1.2.30,"Thou sayest well, and it holds well too, for the"
145,Henry IV,8,1.2.31,fortune of us that are the moon's men doth ebb and
146,Henry IV,8,1.2.32,"flow like the sea, being governed, as the sea is,"
147,Henry IV,8,1.2.33,"by the moon. As, for proof, now: a purse of gold"
148,Henry IV,8,1.2.34,most resolutely snatched on Monday night and most
149,Henry IV,8,1.2.35,"dissolutely spent on Tuesday morning, got with"
150,Henry IV,8,1.2.36,"swearing 'Lay by' and spent with crying 'Bring in,'"
151,Henry IV,8,1.2.37,now in as low an ebb as the foot of the ladder
152,Henry IV,8,1.2.38,and by and by in as high a flow as the ridge of the gallows.
153,Henry IV,9,1.2.39,"By the Lord, thou sayest true, lad. And is not my"
154,Henry IV,9,1.2.40,hostess of the tavern a most sweet wench?
155,Henry IV,10,1.2.41,"As the honey of Hybla, my old lad of the castle. And"
156,Henry IV,10,1.2.42,is not a buff jerkin a most sweet robe of durance?
157,Henry IV,11,1.2.43,"How now, how now, mad wag! what, in thy quips and"
158,Henry IV,11,1.2.44,thy quiddities? what a plague have I to do with a
159,Henry IV,11,1.2.45,buff jerkin?
160,Henry IV,12,1.2.46,"Why, what a pox have I to do with my hostess of the tavern?"
161,Henry IV,13,1.2.47,"Well, thou hast called her to a reckoning many a"
162,Henry IV,13,1.2.48,time and oft.
163,Henry IV,14,1.2.49,Did I ever call for thee to pay thy part?
164,Henry IV,15,1.2.50,"No, I'll give thee thy due, thou hast paid all there."
165,Henry IV,16,1.2.51,"Yea, and elsewhere, so far as my coin would stretch,"
166,Henry IV,16,1.2.52,"and where it would not, I have used my credit."
167,Henry IV,17,1.2.53,"Yea, and so used it that were it not here apparent"
168,Henry IV,17,1.2.54,"that thou art heir apparent--But, I prithee, sweet"
169,Henry IV,17,1.2.55,"wag, shall there be gallows standing in England when"
170,Henry IV,17,1.2.56,thou art king? and resolution thus fobbed as it is
171,Henry IV,17,1.2.57,with the rusty curb of old father antic the law? Do
172,Henry IV,17,1.2.58,"not thou, when thou art king, hang a thief."
173,Henry IV,18,1.2.59,"No, thou shalt."
174,Henry IV,19,1.2.60,"Shall I? O rare! By the Lord, I'll be a brave judge."
175,Henry IV,20,1.2.61,"Thou judgest false already: I mean, thou shalt have"
176,Henry IV,20,1.2.62,the hanging of the thieves and so become a rare hangman.
177,Henry IV,21,1.2.63,"Well, Hal, well, and in some sort it jumps with my"
178,Henry IV,21,1.2.64,"humour as well as waiting in the court, I can tell"
179,Henry IV,21,1.2.65,you.
180,Henry IV,22,1.2.66,For obtaining of suits?
181,Henry IV,23,1.2.67,"Yea, for obtaining of suits, whereof the hangman"
182,Henry IV,23,1.2.68,"hath no lean wardrobe. 'Sblood, I am as melancholy"
183,Henry IV,23,1.2.69,as a gib cat or a lugged bear.
184,Henry IV,24,1.2.70,"Or an old lion, or a lover's lute."
185,Henry IV,25,1.2.71,"Yea, or the drone of a Lincolnshire bagpipe."
186,Henry IV,26,1.2.72,"What sayest thou to a hare, or the melancholy of"
187,Henry IV,26,1.2.73,Moor-ditch?
188,Henry IV,27,1.2.74,Thou hast the most unsavoury similes and art indeed
189,Henry IV,27,1.2.75,"the most comparative, rascalliest, sweet young"
190,Henry IV,27,1.2.76,"prince. But, Hal, I prithee, trouble me no more"
191,Henry IV,27,1.2.77,with vanity. I would to God thou and I knew where a
192,Henry IV,27,1.2.78,commodity of good names were to be bought. An old
193,Henry IV,27,1.2.79,lord of the council rated me the other day in the
194,Henry IV,27,1.2.80,"street about you, sir, but I marked him not, and yet"
195,Henry IV,27,1.2.81,"he talked very wisely, but I regarded him not, and"
196,Henry IV,27,1.2.82,"yet he talked wisely, and in the street too."
197,Henry IV,28,1.2.83,"Thou didst well, for wisdom cries out in the"
198,Henry IV,28,1.2.84,"streets, and no man regards it."
199,Henry IV,29,1.2.85,"O, thou hast damnable iteration and art indeed able"
200,Henry IV,29,1.2.86,to corrupt a saint. Thou hast done much harm upon
201,Henry IV,29,1.2.87,"me, Hal, God forgive thee for it! Before I knew"
202,Henry IV,29,1.2.88,"thee, Hal, I knew nothing, and now am I, if a man"
203,Henry IV,29,1.2.89,"should speak truly, little better than one of the"
204,Henry IV,29,1.2.90,"wicked. I must give over this life, and I will give"
205,Henry IV,29,1.2.91,"it over: by the Lord, and I do not, I am a villain:"
206,Henry IV,29,1.2.92,I'll be damned for never a king's son in
207,Henry IV,29,1.2.93,Christendom.
208,Henry IV,30,1.2.94,"Where shall we take a purse tomorrow, Jack?"
209,Henry IV,31,1.2.95,"'Zounds, where thou wilt, lad, I'll make one, an I"
210,Henry IV,31,1.2.96,"do not, call me villain and baffle me."
211,Henry IV,32,1.2.97,"I see a good amendment of life in thee, from praying"
212,Henry IV,32,1.2.98,to purse-taking.
213,Henry IV,33,1.2.99,"Why, Hal, 'tis my vocation, Hal, 'tis no sin for a"
214,Henry IV,33,1.2.100,man to labour in his vocation.
215,Henry IV,33,,Enter POINS
216,Henry IV,33,1.2.101,Poins! Now shall we know if Gadshill have set a
217,Henry IV,33,1.2.102,"match. O, if men were to be saved by merit, what"
218,Henry IV,33,1.2.103,hole in hell were hot enough for him? This is the
219,Henry IV,33,1.2.104,most omnipotent villain that ever cried 'Stand' to
220,Henry IV,33,1.2.105,a true man.
221,Henry IV,34,1.2.106,"Good morrow, Ned."
222,Henry IV,35,1.2.107,"Good morrow, sweet Hal. What says Monsieur Remorse?"
223,Henry IV,35,1.2.108,what says Sir John Sack and Sugar? Jack! how
224,Henry IV,35,1.2.109,"agrees the devil and thee about thy soul, that thou"
225,Henry IV,35,1.2.110,soldest him on Good-Friday last for a cup of Madeira
226,Henry IV,35,1.2.111,and a cold capon's leg?
227,Henry IV,36,1.2.112,"Sir John stands to his word, the devil shall have"
228,Henry IV,36,1.2.113,"his bargain, for he was never yet a breaker of"
229,Henry IV,36,1.2.114,proverbs: he will give the devil his due.
230,Henry IV,37,1.2.115,Then art thou damned for keeping thy word with the devil.
231,Henry IV,38,1.2.116,Else he had been damned for cozening the devil.
232,Henry IV,39,1.2.117,"But, my lads, my lads, to-morrow morning, by four"
233,Henry IV,39,1.2.118,"o'clock, early at Gadshill! there are pilgrims going"
234,Henry IV,39,1.2.119,"to Canterbury with rich offerings, and traders"
235,Henry IV,39,1.2.120,riding to London with fat purses: I have vizards
236,Henry IV,39,1.2.121,"for you all, you have horses for yourselves:"
237,Henry IV,39,1.2.122,Gadshill lies to-night in Rochester: I have bespoke
238,Henry IV,39,1.2.123,supper to-morrow night in Eastcheap: we may do it
239,Henry IV,39,1.2.124,"as secure as sleep. If you will go, I will stuff"
240,Henry IV,39,1.2.125,"your purses full of crowns, if you will not, tarry"
241,Henry IV,39,1.2.126,at home and be hanged.
242,Henry IV,40,1.2.127,"Hear ye, Yedward, if I tarry at home and go not,"
243,Henry IV,40,1.2.128,I'll hang you for going.
244,Henry IV,41,1.2.129,"You will, chops?"
245,Henry IV,42,1.2.130,"Hal, wilt thou make one?"
246,Henry IV,43,1.2.131,"Who, I rob? I a thief? not I, by my faith."
247,Henry IV,44,1.2.132,"There's neither honesty, manhood, nor good"
248,Henry IV,44,1.2.133,"fellowship in thee, nor thou camest not of the blood"
249,Henry IV,44,1.2.134,"royal, if thou darest not stand for ten shillings."
250,Henry IV,45,1.2.135,"Well then, once in my days I'll be a madcap."
251,Henry IV,46,1.2.136,"Why, that's well said."
252,Henry IV,47,1.2.137,"Well, come what will, I'll tarry at home."
253,Henry IV,48,1.2.138,"By the Lord, I'll be a traitor then, when thou art king."
254,Henry IV,49,1.2.139,I care not.
255,Henry IV,50,1.2.140,"Sir John, I prithee, leave the prince and me alone:"
256,Henry IV,50,1.2.141,I will lay him down such reasons for this adventure
257,Henry IV,50,1.2.142,that he shall go.
258,Henry IV,51,1.2.143,"Well, God give thee the spirit of persuasion and him"
259,Henry IV,51,1.2.144,"the ears of profiting, that what thou speakest may"
260,Henry IV,51,1.2.145,"move and what he hears may be believed, that the"
261,Henry IV,51,1.2.146,"true prince may, for recreation sake, prove a false"
262,Henry IV,51,1.2.147,"thief, for the poor abuses of the time want"
263,Henry IV,51,1.2.148,countenance. Farewell: you shall find me in Eastcheap.
264,Henry IV,52,1.2.149,"Farewell, thou latter spring! farewell, All-hallown summer!"
265,Henry IV,52,,Exit Falstaff
266,Henry IV,53,1.2.150,"Now, my good sweet honey lord, ride with us"
267,Henry IV,53,1.2.151,to-morrow: I have a jest to execute that I cannot
268,Henry IV,53,1.2.152,"manage alone. Falstaff, Bardolph, Peto and Gadshill"
269,Henry IV,53,1.2.153,shall rob those men that we have already waylaid:
270,Henry IV,53,1.2.154,"yourself and I will not be there, and when they"
271,Henry IV,53,1.2.155,"have the booty, if you and I do not rob them, cut"
272,Henry IV,53,1.2.156,this head off from my shoulders.
273,Henry IV,54,1.2.157,How shall we part with them in setting forth?
274,Henry IV,55,1.2.158,"Why, we will set forth before or after them, and"
275,Henry IV,55,1.2.159,"appoint them a place of meeting, wherein it is at"
276,Henry IV,55,1.2.160,"our pleasure to fail, and then will they adventure"
277,Henry IV,55,1.2.161,"upon the exploit themselves, which they shall have"
278,Henry IV,55,1.2.162,"no sooner achieved, but we'll set upon them."
279,Henry IV,56,1.2.163,"Yea, but 'tis like that they will know us by our"
280,Henry IV,56,1.2.164,"horses, by our habits and by every other"
281,Henry IV,56,1.2.165,"appointment, to be ourselves."
282,Henry IV,57,1.2.166,Tut! our horses they shall not see: I'll tie them
283,Henry IV,57,1.2.167,"in the wood, our vizards we will change after we"
284,Henry IV,57,1.2.168,"leave them: and, sirrah, I have cases of buckram"
285,Henry IV,57,1.2.169,"for the nonce, to immask our noted outward garments."
286,Henry IV,58,1.2.170,"Yea, but I doubt they will be too hard for us."
287,Henry IV,59,1.2.171,"Well, for two of them, I know them to be as"
288,Henry IV,59,1.2.172,"true-bred cowards as ever turned back, and for the"
289,Henry IV,59,1.2.173,"third, if he fight longer than he sees reason, I'll"
290,Henry IV,59,1.2.174,"forswear arms. The virtue of this jest will be, the"
291,Henry IV,59,1.2.175,incomprehensible lies that this same fat rogue will
292,Henry IV,59,1.2.176,"tell us when we meet at supper: how thirty, at"
293,Henry IV,59,1.2.177,"least, he fought with, what wards, what blows, what"
294,Henry IV,59,1.2.178,"extremities he endured, and in the reproof of this"
295,Henry IV,59,1.2.179,lies the jest.
296,Henry IV,60,1.2.180,"Well, I'll go with thee: provide us all things"
297,Henry IV,60,1.2.181,"necessary and meet me to-morrow night in Eastcheap,"
298,Henry IV,60,1.2.182,there I'll sup. Farewell.
299,Henry IV,61,1.2.183,"Farewell, my lord."
300,Henry IV,61,,Exit Poins
301,Henry IV,62,1.2.184,"I know you all, and will awhile uphold"
302,Henry IV,62,1.2.185,The unyoked humour of your idleness:
303,Henry IV,62,1.2.186,"Yet herein will I imitate the sun,"
304,Henry IV,62,1.2.187,Who doth permit the base contagious clouds
305,Henry IV,62,1.2.188,"To smother up his beauty from the world,"
306,Henry IV,62,1.2.189,"That, when he please again to be himself,"
307,Henry IV,62,1.2.190,"Being wanted, he may be more wonder'd at,"
308,Henry IV,62,1.2.191,By breaking through the foul and ugly mists
309,Henry IV,62,1.2.192,Of vapours that did seem to strangle him.
310,Henry IV,62,1.2.193,"If all the year were playing holidays,"
311,Henry IV,62,1.2.194,"To sport would be as tedious as to work,"
312,Henry IV,62,1.2.195,"But when they seldom come, they wish'd for come,"
313,Henry IV,62,1.2.196,And nothing pleaseth but rare accidents.
314,Henry IV,62,1.2.197,"So, when this loose behavior I throw off"
315,Henry IV,62,1.2.198,"And pay the debt I never promised,"
316,Henry IV,62,1.2.199,"By how much better than my word I am,"
317,Henry IV,62,1.2.200,"By so much shall I falsify men's hopes,"
318,Henry IV,62,1.2.201,"And like bright metal on a sullen ground,"
319,Henry IV,62,1.2.202,"My reformation, glittering o'er my fault,"
320,Henry IV,62,1.2.203,Shall show more goodly and attract more eyes
321,Henry IV,62,1.2.204,Than that which hath no foil to set it off.
322,Henry IV,62,1.2.205,"I'll so offend, to make offence a skill,"
323,Henry IV,62,1.2.206,Redeeming time when men think least I will.
324,Henry IV,62,,Exit
325,Henry IV,62,,SCENE III. London. The palace.
326,Henry IV,62,,"Enter the KING, NORTHUMBERLAND, WORCESTER, HOTSPUR, SIR WALTER BLUNT, with others"
327,Henry IV,1,1.3.1,"My blood hath been too cold and temperate,"
328,Henry IV,1,1.3.2,"Unapt to stir at these indignities,"
329,Henry IV,1,1.3.3,"And you have found me, for accordingly"
330,Henry IV,1,1.3.4,You tread upon my patience: but be sure
331,Henry IV,1,1.3.5,"I will from henceforth rather be myself,"
332,Henry IV,1,1.3.6,"Mighty and to be fear'd, than my condition,"
333,Henry IV,1,1.3.7,"Which hath been smooth as oil, soft as young down,"
334,Henry IV,1,1.3.8,And therefore lost that title of respect
335,Henry IV,1,1.3.9,Which the proud soul ne'er pays but to the proud.
336,Henry IV,2,1.3.10,"Our house, my sovereign liege, little deserves"
337,Henry IV,2,1.3.11,"The scourge of greatness to be used on it,"
338,Henry IV,2,1.3.12,And that same greatness too which our own hands
339,Henry IV,2,1.3.13,Have holp to make so portly.
340,Henry IV,3,1.3.14,My lord.--
341,Henry IV,4,1.3.15,"Worcester, get thee gone, for I do see"
342,Henry IV,4,1.3.16,Danger and disobedience in thine eye:
343,Henry IV,4,1.3.17,"O, sir, your presence is too bold and peremptory,"
344,Henry IV,4,1.3.18,And majesty might never yet endure
345,Henry IV,4,1.3.19,The moody frontier of a servant brow.
346,Henry IV,4,1.3.20,You have good leave to leave us: when we need
347,Henry IV,4,1.3.21,"Your use and counsel, we shall send for you."
348,Henry IV,4,,Exit Worcester
349,Henry IV,4,1.3.22,You were about to speak.
350,Henry IV,4,,To North
351,Henry IV,5,1.3.23,"Yea, my good lord."
352,Henry IV,5,1.3.24,"Those prisoners in your highness' name demanded,"
353,Henry IV,5,1.3.25,"Which Harry Percy here at Holmedon took,"
354,Henry IV,5,1.3.26,"Were, as he says, not with such strength denied"
355,Henry IV,5,1.3.27,As is deliver'd to your majesty:
356,Henry IV,5,1.3.28,"Either envy, therefore, or misprison"
357,Henry IV,5,1.3.29,Is guilty of this fault and not my son.
358,Henry IV,6,1.3.30,"My liege, I did deny no prisoners."
359,Henry IV,6,1.3.31,"But I remember, when the fight was done,"
360,Henry IV,6,1.3.32,"When I was dry with rage and extreme toil,"
361,Henry IV,6,1.3.33,"Breathless and faint, leaning upon my sword,"
362,Henry IV,6,1.3.34,"Came there a certain lord, neat, and trimly dress'd,"
363,Henry IV,6,1.3.35,"Fresh as a bridegroom, and his chin new reap'd"
364,Henry IV,6,1.3.36,"Show'd like a stubble-land at harvest-home,"
365,Henry IV,6,1.3.37,"He was perfumed like a milliner,"
366,Henry IV,6,1.3.38,And 'twixt his finger and his thumb he held
367,Henry IV,6,1.3.39,"A pouncet-box, which ever and anon"
368,Henry IV,6,1.3.40,"He gave his nose and took't away again,"
369,Henry IV,6,1.3.41,"Who therewith angry, when it next came there,"
370,Henry IV,6,1.3.42,"Took it in snuff, and still he smiled and talk'd,"
371,Henry IV,6,1.3.43,"And as the soldiers bore dead bodies by,"
372,Henry IV,6,1.3.44,"He call'd them untaught knaves, unmannerly,"
373,Henry IV,6,1.3.45,To bring a slovenly unhandsome corse
374,Henry IV,6,1.3.46,Betwixt the wind and his nobility.
375,Henry IV,6,1.3.47,With many holiday and lady terms
376,Henry IV,6,1.3.48,"He question'd me, amongst the rest, demanded"
377,Henry IV,6,1.3.49,My prisoners in your majesty's behalf.
378,Henry IV,6,1.3.50,"I then, all smarting with my wounds being cold,"
379,Henry IV,6,1.3.51,"To be so pester'd with a popinjay,"
380,Henry IV,6,1.3.52,"Out of my grief and my impatience,"
381,Henry IV,6,1.3.53,"Answer'd neglectingly I know not what,"
382,Henry IV,6,1.3.54,"He should or he should not, for he made me mad"
383,Henry IV,6,1.3.55,To see him shine so brisk and smell so sweet
384,Henry IV,6,1.3.56,And talk so like a waiting-gentlewoman
385,Henry IV,6,1.3.57,"Of guns and drums and wounds,--God save the mark!--"
386,Henry IV,6,1.3.58,And telling me the sovereign'st thing on earth
387,Henry IV,6,1.3.59,"Was parmaceti for an inward bruise,"
388,Henry IV,6,1.3.60,"And that it was great pity, so it was,"
389,Henry IV,6,1.3.61,This villanous salt-petre should be digg'd
390,Henry IV,6,1.3.62,"Out of the bowels of the harmless earth,"
391,Henry IV,6,1.3.63,Which many a good tall fellow had destroy'd
392,Henry IV,6,1.3.64,"So cowardly, and but for these vile guns,"
393,Henry IV,6,1.3.65,He would himself have been a soldier.
394,Henry IV,6,1.3.66,"This bald unjointed chat of his, my lord,"
395,Henry IV,6,1.3.67,"I answer'd indirectly, as I said,"
396,Henry IV,6,1.3.68,"And I beseech you, let not his report"
397,Henry IV,6,1.3.69,Come current for an accusation
398,Henry IV,6,1.3.70,Betwixt my love and your high majesty.
399,Henry IV,7,1.3.71,"The circumstance consider'd, good my lord,"
400,Henry IV,7,1.3.72,Whate'er Lord Harry Percy then had said
401,Henry IV,7,1.3.73,"To such a person and in such a place,"
402,Henry IV,7,1.3.74,"At such a time, with all the rest retold,"
403,Henry IV,7,1.3.75,May reasonably die and never rise
404,Henry IV,7,1.3.76,To do him wrong or any way impeach
405,Henry IV,7,1.3.77,"What then he said, so he unsay it now."
406,Henry IV,8,1.3.78,"Why, yet he doth deny his prisoners,"
407,Henry IV,8,1.3.79,"But with proviso and exception,"
408,Henry IV,8,1.3.80,That we at our own charge shall ransom straight
409,Henry IV,8,1.3.81,"His brother-in-law, the foolish Mortimer,"
410,Henry IV,8,1.3.82,"Who, on my soul, hath wilfully betray'd"
411,Henry IV,8,1.3.83,The lives of those that he did lead to fight
412,Henry IV,8,1.3.84,"Against that great magician, damn'd Glendower,"
413,Henry IV,8,1.3.85,"Whose daughter, as we hear, the Earl of March"
414,Henry IV,8,1.3.86,"Hath lately married. Shall our coffers, then,"
415,Henry IV,8,1.3.87,Be emptied to redeem a traitor home?
416,Henry IV,8,1.3.88,"Shall we but treason? and indent with fears,"
417,Henry IV,8,1.3.89,When they have lost and forfeited themselves?
418,Henry IV,8,1.3.90,"No, on the barren mountains let him starve,"
419,Henry IV,8,1.3.91,For I shall never hold that man my friend
420,Henry IV,8,1.3.92,Whose tongue shall ask me for one penny cost
421,Henry IV,8,1.3.93,To ransom home revolted Mortimer.
422,Henry IV,9,1.3.94,Revolted Mortimer!
423,Henry IV,9,1.3.95,"He never did fall off, my sovereign liege,"
424,Henry IV,9,1.3.96,"But by the chance of war, to prove that true"
425,Henry IV,9,1.3.97,"Needs no more but one tongue for all those wounds,"
426,Henry IV,9,1.3.98,"Those mouthed wounds, which valiantly he took"
427,Henry IV,9,1.3.99,"When on the gentle Severn's sedgy bank,"
428,Henry IV,9,1.3.100,"In single opposition, hand to hand,"
429,Henry IV,9,1.3.101,He did confound the best part of an hour
430,Henry IV,9,1.3.102,In changing hardiment with great Glendower:
431,Henry IV,9,1.3.103,Three times they breathed and three times did
432,Henry IV,9,1.3.104,"they drink,"
433,Henry IV,9,1.3.105,"Upon agreement, of swift Severn's flood,"
434,Henry IV,9,1.3.106,"Who then, affrighted with their bloody looks,"
435,Henry IV,9,1.3.107,"Ran fearfully among the trembling reeds,"
436,Henry IV,9,1.3.108,"And hid his crisp head in the hollow bank,"
437,Henry IV,9,1.3.109,Bloodstained with these valiant combatants.
438,Henry IV,9,1.3.110,Never did base and rotten policy
439,Henry IV,9,1.3.111,"Colour her working with such deadly wounds,"
440,Henry IV,9,1.3.112,Nor could the noble Mortimer
441,Henry IV,9,1.3.113,"Receive so many, and all willingly:"
442,Henry IV,9,1.3.114,Then let not him be slander'd with revolt.
443,Henry IV,10,1.3.115,"Thou dost belie him, Percy, thou dost belie him,"
444,Henry IV,10,1.3.116,He never did encounter with Glendower:
445,Henry IV,10,1.3.117,"I tell thee,"
446,Henry IV,10,1.3.118,He durst as well have met the devil alone
447,Henry IV,10,1.3.119,As Owen Glendower for an enemy.
448,Henry IV,10,1.3.120,"Art thou not ashamed? But, sirrah, henceforth"
449,Henry IV,10,1.3.121,Let me not hear you speak of Mortimer:
450,Henry IV,10,1.3.122,"Send me your prisoners with the speediest means,"
451,Henry IV,10,1.3.123,Or you shall hear in such a kind from me
452,Henry IV,10,1.3.124,"As will displease you. My Lord Northumberland,"
453,Henry IV,10,1.3.125,We licence your departure with your son.
454,Henry IV,10,1.3.126,"Send us your prisoners, or you will hear of it."
455,Henry IV,10,,"Exeunt King Henry, Blunt, and train"
456,Henry IV,11,1.3.127,"An if the devil come and roar for them,"
457,Henry IV,11,1.3.128,I will not send them: I will after straight
458,Henry IV,11,1.3.129,"And tell him so, for I will ease my heart,"
459,Henry IV,11,1.3.130,Albeit I make a hazard of my head.
460,Henry IV,12,1.3.131,"What, drunk with choler? stay and pause awhile:"
461,Henry IV,12,1.3.132,Here comes your uncle.
462,Henry IV,12,,Re-enter WORCESTER
463,Henry IV,13,1.3.133,Speak of Mortimer!
464,Henry IV,13,1.3.134,"'Zounds, I will speak of him, and let my soul"
465,Henry IV,13,1.3.135,"Want mercy, if I do not join with him:"
466,Henry IV,13,1.3.136,"Yea, on his part I'll empty all these veins,"
467,Henry IV,13,1.3.137,"And shed my dear blood drop by drop in the dust,"
468,Henry IV,13,1.3.138,But I will lift the down-trod Mortimer
469,Henry IV,13,1.3.139,"As high in the air as this unthankful king,"
470,Henry IV,13,1.3.140,As this ingrate and canker'd Bolingbroke.
471,Henry IV,14,1.3.141,"Brother, the king hath made your nephew mad."
472,Henry IV,15,1.3.142,Who struck this heat up after I was gone?
473,Henry IV,16,1.3.143,"He will, forsooth, have all my prisoners,"
474,Henry IV,16,1.3.144,And when I urged the ransom once again
475,Henry IV,16,1.3.145,"Of my wife's brother, then his cheek look'd pale,"
476,Henry IV,16,1.3.146,"And on my face he turn'd an eye of death,"
477,Henry IV,16,1.3.147,Trembling even at the name of Mortimer.
478,Henry IV,17,1.3.148,I cannot blame him: was not he proclaim'd
479,Henry IV,17,1.3.149,By Richard that dead is the next of blood?
480,Henry IV,18,1.3.150,"He was, I heard the proclamation:"
481,Henry IV,18,1.3.151,"And then it was when the unhappy king,"
482,Henry IV,18,1.3.152,--Whose wrongs in us God pardon!--did set forth
483,Henry IV,18,1.3.153,"Upon his Irish expedition,"
484,Henry IV,18,1.3.154,From whence he intercepted did return
485,Henry IV,18,1.3.155,To be deposed and shortly murdered.
486,Henry IV,19,1.3.156,And for whose death we in the world's wide mouth
487,Henry IV,19,1.3.157,Live scandalized and foully spoken of.
488,Henry IV,20,1.3.158,"But soft, I pray you, did King Richard then"
489,Henry IV,20,1.3.159,Proclaim my brother Edmund Mortimer
490,Henry IV,20,1.3.160,Heir to the crown?
491,Henry IV,21,1.3.161,"He did, myself did hear it."
492,Henry IV,22,1.3.162,"Nay, then I cannot blame his cousin king,"
493,Henry IV,22,1.3.163,That wished him on the barren mountains starve.
494,Henry IV,22,1.3.164,"But shall it be that you, that set the crown"
495,Henry IV,22,1.3.165,Upon the head of this forgetful man
496,Henry IV,22,1.3.166,And for his sake wear the detested blot
497,Henry IV,22,1.3.167,"Of murderous subornation, shall it be,"
498,Henry IV,22,1.3.168,"That you a world of curses undergo,"
499,Henry IV,22,1.3.169,"Being the agents, or base second means,"
500,Henry IV,22,1.3.170,"The cords, the ladder, or the hangman rather?"
501,Henry IV,22,1.3.171,"O, pardon me that I descend so low,"
502,Henry IV,22,1.3.172,To show the line and the predicament
503,Henry IV,22,1.3.173,"Wherein you range under this subtle king,"
504,Henry IV,22,1.3.174,"Shall it for shame be spoken in these days,"
505,Henry IV,22,1.3.175,"Or fill up chronicles in time to come,"
506,Henry IV,22,1.3.176,That men of your nobility and power
507,Henry IV,22,1.3.177,"Did gage them both in an unjust behalf,"
508,Henry IV,22,1.3.178,"As both of you--God pardon it!--have done,"
509,Henry IV,22,1.3.179,"To put down Richard, that sweet lovely rose,"
510,Henry IV,22,1.3.180,"An plant this thorn, this canker, Bolingbroke?"
511,Henry IV,22,1.3.181,"And shall it in more shame be further spoken,"
512,Henry IV,22,1.3.182,"That you are fool'd, discarded and shook off"
513,Henry IV,22,1.3.183,By him for whom these shames ye underwent?
514,Henry IV,22,1.3.184,"No, yet time serves wherein you may redeem"
515,Henry IV,22,1.3.185,Your banish'd honours and restore yourselves
516,Henry IV,22,1.3.186,"Into the good thoughts of the world again,"
517,Henry IV,22,1.3.187,Revenge the jeering and disdain'd contempt
518,Henry IV,22,1.3.188,"Of this proud king, who studies day and night"
519,Henry IV,22,1.3.189,To answer all the debt he owes to you
520,Henry IV,22,1.3.190,Even with the bloody payment of your deaths:
521,Henry IV,22,1.3.191,"Therefore, I say--"
522,Henry IV,23,1.3.192,"Peace, cousin, say no more:"
523,Henry IV,23,1.3.193,"And now I will unclasp a secret book,"
524,Henry IV,23,1.3.194,And to your quick-conceiving discontents
525,Henry IV,23,1.3.195,"I'll read you matter deep and dangerous,"
526,Henry IV,23,1.3.196,As full of peril and adventurous spirit
527,Henry IV,23,1.3.197,As to o'er-walk a current roaring loud
528,Henry IV,23,1.3.198,On the unsteadfast footing of a spear.
529,Henry IV,24,1.3.199,"If he fall in, good night! or sink or swim:"
530,Henry IV,24,1.3.200,"Send danger from the east unto the west,"
531,Henry IV,24,1.3.201,"So honour cross it from the north to south,"
532,Henry IV,24,1.3.202,"And let them grapple: O, the blood more stirs"
533,Henry IV,24,1.3.203,To rouse a lion than to start a hare!
534,Henry IV,25,1.3.204,Imagination of some great exploit
535,Henry IV,25,1.3.205,Drives him beyond the bounds of patience.
536,Henry IV,26,1.3.206,"By heaven, methinks it were an easy leap,"
537,Henry IV,26,1.3.207,"To pluck bright honour from the pale-faced moon,"
538,Henry IV,26,1.3.208,"Or dive into the bottom of the deep,"
539,Henry IV,26,1.3.209,"Where fathom-line could never touch the ground,"
540,Henry IV,26,1.3.210,"And pluck up drowned honour by the locks,"
541,Henry IV,26,1.3.211,So he that doth redeem her thence might wear
542,Henry IV,26,1.3.212,"Without corrival, all her dignities:"
543,Henry IV,26,1.3.213,But out upon this half-faced fellowship!
544,Henry IV,27,1.3.214,"He apprehends a world of figures here,"
545,Henry IV,27,1.3.215,But not the form of what he should attend.
546,Henry IV,27,1.3.216,"Good cousin, give me audience for a while."
547,Henry IV,28,1.3.217,I cry you mercy.
548,Henry IV,29,1.3.218,Those same noble Scots
549,Henry IV,29,1.3.219,"That are your prisoners,--"
550,Henry IV,30,1.3.220,"I'll keep them all,"
551,Henry IV,30,1.3.221,"By God, he shall not have a Scot of them,"
552,Henry IV,30,1.3.222,"No, if a Scot would save his soul, he shall not:"
553,Henry IV,30,1.3.223,"I'll keep them, by this hand."
554,Henry IV,31,1.3.224,You start away
555,Henry IV,31,1.3.225,And lend no ear unto my purposes.
556,Henry IV,31,1.3.226,Those prisoners you shall keep.
557,Henry IV,32,1.3.227,"Nay, I will, that's flat:"
558,Henry IV,32,1.3.228,"He said he would not ransom Mortimer,"
559,Henry IV,32,1.3.229,"Forbad my tongue to speak of Mortimer,"
560,Henry IV,32,1.3.230,"But I will find him when he lies asleep,"
561,Henry IV,32,1.3.231,And in his ear I'll holla 'Mortimer!'
562,Henry IV,32,1.3.232,"Nay,"
563,Henry IV,32,1.3.233,I'll have a starling shall be taught to speak
564,Henry IV,32,1.3.234,"Nothing but 'Mortimer,' and give it him"
565,Henry IV,32,1.3.235,To keep his anger still in motion.
566,Henry IV,33,1.3.236,"Hear you, cousin, a word."
567,Henry IV,34,1.3.237,"All studies here I solemnly defy,"
568,Henry IV,34,1.3.238,Save how to gall and pinch this Bolingbroke:
569,Henry IV,34,1.3.239,"And that same sword-and-buckler Prince of Wales,"
570,Henry IV,34,1.3.240,But that I think his father loves him not
571,Henry IV,34,1.3.241,"And would be glad he met with some mischance,"
572,Henry IV,34,1.3.242,I would have him poison'd with a pot of ale.
573,Henry IV,35,1.3.243,"Farewell, kinsman: I'll talk to you"
574,Henry IV,35,1.3.244,When you are better temper'd to attend.
575,Henry IV,36,1.3.245,"Why, what a wasp-stung and impatient fool"
576,Henry IV,36,1.3.246,"Art thou to break into this woman's mood,"
577,Henry IV,36,1.3.247,Tying thine ear to no tongue but thine own!
578,Henry IV,37,1.3.248,"Why, look you, I am whipp'd and scourged with rods,"
579,Henry IV,37,1.3.249,"Nettled and stung with pismires, when I hear"
580,Henry IV,37,1.3.250,"Of this vile politician, Bolingbroke."
581,Henry IV,37,1.3.251,"In Richard's time,--what do you call the place?--"
582,Henry IV,37,1.3.252,"A plague upon it, it is in Gloucestershire,"
583,Henry IV,37,1.3.253,"'Twas where the madcap duke his uncle kept,"
584,Henry IV,37,1.3.254,"His uncle York, where I first bow'd my knee"
585,Henry IV,37,1.3.255,"Unto this king of smiles, this Bolingbroke,--"
586,Henry IV,37,1.3.256,'Sblood!--
587,Henry IV,37,1.3.257,When you and he came back from Ravenspurgh.
588,Henry IV,38,1.3.258,At Berkley castle.
589,Henry IV,39,1.3.259,You say true:
590,Henry IV,39,1.3.260,"Why, what a candy deal of courtesy"
591,Henry IV,39,1.3.261,This fawning greyhound then did proffer me!
592,Henry IV,39,1.3.262,"Look,'when his infant fortune came to age,'"
593,Henry IV,39,1.3.263,"And 'gentle Harry Percy,' and 'kind cousin,'"
594,Henry IV,39,1.3.264,"O, the devil take such cozeners! God forgive me!"
595,Henry IV,39,1.3.265,"Good uncle, tell your tale, I have done."
596,Henry IV,40,1.3.266,"Nay, if you have not, to it again,"
597,Henry IV,40,1.3.267,We will stay your leisure.
598,Henry IV,41,1.3.268,"I have done, i' faith."
599,Henry IV,42,1.3.269,Then once more to your Scottish prisoners.
600,Henry IV,42,1.3.270,"Deliver them up without their ransom straight,"
601,Henry IV,42,1.3.271,And make the Douglas' son your only mean
602,Henry IV,42,1.3.272,"For powers in Scotland, which, for divers reasons"
603,Henry IV,42,1.3.273,"Which I shall send you written, be assured,"
604,Henry IV,42,1.3.274,"Will easily be granted. You, my lord,"
605,Henry IV,42,,To Northumberland
606,Henry IV,42,1.3.275,"Your son in Scotland being thus employ'd,"
607,Henry IV,42,1.3.276,Shall secretly into the bosom creep
608,Henry IV,42,1.3.277,"Of that same noble prelate, well beloved,"
609,Henry IV,42,1.3.278,The archbishop.
610,Henry IV,43,1.3.279,"Of York, is it not?"
611,Henry IV,44,1.3.280,"True, who bears hard"
612,Henry IV,44,1.3.281,"His brother's death at Bristol, the Lord Scroop."
613,Henry IV,44,1.3.282,"I speak not this in estimation,"
614,Henry IV,44,1.3.283,"As what I think might be, but what I know"
615,Henry IV,44,1.3.284,"Is ruminated, plotted and set down,"
616,Henry IV,44,1.3.285,And only stays but to behold the face
617,Henry IV,44,1.3.286,Of that occasion that shall bring it on.
618,Henry IV,45,1.3.287,"I smell it: upon my life, it will do well."
619,Henry IV,46,1.3.288,"Before the game is afoot, thou still let'st slip."
620,Henry IV,47,1.3.289,"Why, it cannot choose but be a noble plot,"
621,Henry IV,47,1.3.290,"And then the power of Scotland and of York,"
622,Henry IV,47,1.3.291,"To join with Mortimer, ha?"
623,Henry IV,48,1.3.292,And so they shall.
624,Henry IV,49,1.3.293,"In faith, it is exceedingly well aim'd."
625,Henry IV,50,1.3.294,"And 'tis no little reason bids us speed,"
626,Henry IV,50,1.3.295,"To save our heads by raising of a head,"
627,Henry IV,50,1.3.296,"For, bear ourselves as even as we can,"
628,Henry IV,50,1.3.297,"The king will always think him in our debt,"
629,Henry IV,50,1.3.298,"And think we think ourselves unsatisfied,"
630,Henry IV,50,1.3.299,Till he hath found a time to pay us home:
631,Henry IV,50,1.3.300,And see already how he doth begin
632,Henry IV,50,1.3.301,To make us strangers to his looks of love.
633,Henry IV,51,1.3.302,"He does, he does: we'll be revenged on him."
634,Henry IV,52,1.3.303,"Cousin, farewell: no further go in this"
635,Henry IV,52,1.3.304,Than I by letters shall direct your course.
636,Henry IV,52,1.3.305,"When time is ripe, which will be suddenly,"
637,Henry IV,52,1.3.306,"I'll steal to Glendower and Lord Mortimer,"
638,Henry IV,52,1.3.307,"Where you and Douglas and our powers at once,"
639,Henry IV,52,1.3.308,"As I will fashion it, shall happily meet,"
640,Henry IV,52,1.3.309,"To bear our fortunes in our own strong arms,"
641,Henry IV,52,1.3.310,Which now we hold at much uncertainty.
642,Henry IV,53,1.3.311,"Farewell, good brother: we shall thrive, I trust."
643,Henry IV,54,1.3.312,"Uncle, Adieu: O, let the hours be short"
644,Henry IV,54,1.3.313,Till fields and blows and groans applaud our sport!

646,Henry IV,54,,ACT II
647,Henry IV,54,,SCENE I. Rochester. An inn yard.
648,Henry IV,54,,Enter a Carrier with a lantern in his hand
649,Henry IV,1,2.1.1,"Heigh-ho! an it be not four by the day, I'll be"
650,Henry IV,1,2.1.2,"hanged: Charles' wain is over the new chimney, and"
651,Henry IV,1,2.1.3,"yet our horse not packed. What, ostler!"
652,Henry IV,2,2.1.4,"[Within]   Anon, anon."
653,Henry IV,3,2.1.5,"I prithee, Tom, beat Cut's saddle, put a few flocks"
654,Henry IV,3,2.1.6,"in the point, poor jade, is wrung in the withers out"
655,Henry IV,3,2.1.7,of all cess.
656,Henry IV,3,,Enter another Carrier
657,Henry IV,4,2.1.8,"Peas and beans are as dank here as a dog, and that"
658,Henry IV,4,2.1.9,is the next way to give poor jades the bots: this
659,Henry IV,4,2.1.10,house is turned upside down since Robin Ostler died.
660,Henry IV,5,2.1.11,"Poor fellow, never joyed since the price of oats"
661,Henry IV,5,2.1.12,"rose, it was the death of him."
662,Henry IV,6,2.1.13,I think this be the most villanous house in all
663,Henry IV,6,2.1.14,London road for fleas: I am stung like a tench.
664,Henry IV,7,2.1.15,"Like a tench! by the mass, there is ne'er a king"
665,Henry IV,7,2.1.16,christen could be better bit than I have been since
666,Henry IV,7,2.1.17,the first cock.
667,Henry IV,8,2.1.18,"Why, they will allow us ne'er a jordan, and then we"
668,Henry IV,8,2.1.19,"leak in your chimney, and your chamber-lie breeds"
669,Henry IV,8,2.1.20,fleas like a loach.
670,Henry IV,9,2.1.21,"What, ostler! come away and be hanged!"
671,Henry IV,10,2.1.22,"I have a gammon of bacon and two razors of ginger,"
672,Henry IV,10,2.1.23,to be delivered as far as Charing-cross.
673,Henry IV,11,2.1.24,God's body! the turkeys in my pannier are quite
674,Henry IV,11,2.1.25,"starved. What, ostler! A plague on thee! hast thou"
675,Henry IV,11,2.1.26,never an eye in thy head? canst not hear? An
676,Henry IV,11,2.1.27,"'twere not as good deed as drink, to break the pate"
677,Henry IV,11,2.1.28,"on thee, I am a very villain. Come, and be hanged!"
678,Henry IV,11,2.1.29,hast thou no faith in thee?
679,Henry IV,11,,Enter GADSHILL
680,Henry IV,12,2.1.30,"Good morrow, carriers. What's o'clock?"
681,Henry IV,13,2.1.31,I think it be two o'clock.
682,Henry IV,14,2.1.32,"I pray thee lend me thy lantern, to see my gelding"
683,Henry IV,14,2.1.33,in the stable.
684,Henry IV,15,2.1.34,"Nay, by God, soft, I know a trick worth two of that, i' faith."
685,Henry IV,16,2.1.35,"I pray thee, lend me thine."
686,Henry IV,17,2.1.36,"Ay, when? can'st tell? Lend me thy lantern, quoth"
687,Henry IV,17,2.1.37,"he? marry, I'll see thee hanged first."
688,Henry IV,18,2.1.38,"Sirrah carrier, what time do you mean to come to London?"
689,Henry IV,19,2.1.39,"Time enough to go to bed with a candle, I warrant"
690,Henry IV,19,2.1.40,"thee. Come, neighbour Mugs, we'll call up the"
691,Henry IV,19,2.1.41,"gentleman: they will along with company, for they"
692,Henry IV,19,2.1.42,have great charge.
693,Henry IV,19,,Exeunt carriers
694,Henry IV,20,2.1.43,"What, ho! chamberlain!"
695,Henry IV,21,2.1.44,"[Within]  At hand, quoth pick-purse."
696,Henry IV,22,2.1.45,"That's even as fair as--at hand, quoth the"
697,Henry IV,22,2.1.46,"chamberlain, for thou variest no more from picking"
698,Henry IV,22,2.1.47,"of purses than giving direction doth from labouring,"
699,Henry IV,22,2.1.48,thou layest the plot how.
700,Henry IV,22,,Enter Chamberlain
701,Henry IV,23,2.1.49,"Good morrow, Master Gadshill. It holds current that"
702,Henry IV,23,2.1.50,I told you yesternight: there's a franklin in the
703,Henry IV,23,2.1.51,wild of Kent hath brought three hundred marks with
704,Henry IV,23,2.1.52,him in gold: I heard him tell it to one of his
705,Henry IV,23,2.1.53,"company last night at supper, a kind of auditor, one"
706,Henry IV,23,2.1.54,"that hath abundance of charge too, God knows what."
707,Henry IV,23,2.1.55,"They are up already, and call for eggs and butter,"
708,Henry IV,23,2.1.56,they will away presently.
709,Henry IV,24,2.1.57,"Sirrah, if they meet not with Saint Nicholas'"
710,Henry IV,24,2.1.58,"clerks, I'll give thee this neck."
711,Henry IV,25,2.1.59,"No, I'll none of it: I pray thee keep that for the"
712,Henry IV,25,2.1.60,"hangman, for I know thou worshippest St. Nicholas"
713,Henry IV,25,2.1.61,as truly as a man of falsehood may.
714,Henry IV,26,2.1.62,"What talkest thou to me of the hangman? if I hang,"
715,Henry IV,26,2.1.63,"I'll make a fat pair of gallows, for if I hang, old"
716,Henry IV,26,2.1.64,"Sir John hangs with me, and thou knowest he is no"
717,Henry IV,26,2.1.65,starveling. Tut! there are other Trojans that thou
718,Henry IV,26,2.1.66,"dreamest not of, the which for sport sake are"
719,Henry IV,26,2.1.67,"content to do the profession some grace, that would,"
720,Henry IV,26,2.1.68,"if matters should be looked into, for their own"
721,Henry IV,26,2.1.69,"credit sake, make all whole. I am joined with no"
722,Henry IV,26,2.1.70,"foot-land rakers, no long-staff sixpenny strikers,"
723,Henry IV,26,2.1.71,"none of these mad mustachio purple-hued malt-worms,"
724,Henry IV,26,2.1.72,"but with nobility and tranquillity, burgomasters and"
725,Henry IV,26,2.1.73,"great oneyers, such as can hold in, such as will"
726,Henry IV,26,2.1.74,"strike sooner than speak, and speak sooner than"
727,Henry IV,26,2.1.75,"drink, and drink sooner than pray: and yet, zounds,"
728,Henry IV,26,2.1.76,"I lie, for they pray continually to their saint, the"
729,Henry IV,26,2.1.77,"commonwealth, or rather, not pray to her, but prey"
730,Henry IV,26,2.1.78,"on her, for they ride up and down on her and make"
731,Henry IV,26,2.1.79,her their boots.
732,Henry IV,27,2.1.80,"What, the commonwealth their boots? will she hold"
733,Henry IV,27,2.1.81,out water in foul way?
734,Henry IV,28,2.1.82,"She will, she will, justice hath liquored her. We"
735,Henry IV,28,2.1.83,"steal as in a castle, cocksure, we have the receipt"
736,Henry IV,28,2.1.84,"of fern-seed, we walk invisible."
737,Henry IV,29,2.1.85,"Nay, by my faith, I think you are more beholding to"
738,Henry IV,29,2.1.86,the night than to fern-seed for your walking invisible.
739,Henry IV,30,2.1.87,Give me thy hand: thou shalt have a share in our
740,Henry IV,30,2.1.88,"purchase, as I am a true man."
741,Henry IV,31,2.1.89,"Nay, rather let me have it, as you are a false thief."
742,Henry IV,32,2.1.90,"Go to, 'homo' is a common name to all men. Bid the"
743,Henry IV,32,2.1.91,"ostler bring my gelding out of the stable. Farewell,"

750,Henry IV,2,2.2.3,Stand close.
751,Henry IV,2,,Enter FALSTAFF

754,Henry IV,4,2.2.6,thou keep!
755,Henry IV,5,2.2.7,"Where's Poins, Hal?"
756,Henry IV,6,2.2.8,He is walked up to the top of the hill: I'll go seek him.
757,Henry IV,7,2.2.9,I am accursed to rob in that thief's company: the
758,Henry IV,7,2.2.10,"rascal hath removed my horse, and tied him I know"
759,Henry IV,7,2.2.11,not where. If I travel but four foot by the squier
760,Henry IV,7,2.2.12,"further afoot, I shall break my wind. Well, I doubt"
761,Henry IV,7,2.2.13,"not but to die a fair death for all this, if I"
762,Henry IV,7,2.2.14,'scape hanging for killing that rogue. I have
763,Henry IV,7,2.2.15,forsworn his company hourly any time this two and
764,Henry IV,7,2.2.16,"twenty years, and yet I am bewitched with the"
765,Henry IV,7,2.2.17,rogue's company. If the rascal hath not given me
766,Henry IV,7,2.2.18,"medicines to make me love him, I'll be hanged, it"
767,Henry IV,7,2.2.19,could not be else: I have drunk medicines. Poins!
768,Henry IV,7,2.2.20,Hal! a plague upon you both! Bardolph! Peto!
769,Henry IV,7,2.2.21,I'll starve ere I'll rob a foot further. An 'twere

806,Henry IV,21,2.2.56,"Sirs, you four shall front them in the narrow lane,"
807,Henry IV,21,2.2.57,Ned Poins and I will walk lower: if they 'scape
808,Henry IV,21,2.2.58,"from your encounter, then they light on us."
809,Henry IV,22,2.2.59,How many be there of them?
810,Henry IV,23,2.2.60,Some eight or ten.
811,Henry IV,24,2.2.61,"'Zounds, will they not rob us?"
812,Henry IV,25,2.2.62,"What, a coward, Sir John Paunch?"
813,Henry IV,26,2.2.63,"Indeed, I am not John of Gaunt, your grandfather,"

1160,Henry IV,60,2.4.157,"I am a rogue, if I were not at half-sword with a"
1161,Henry IV,60,2.4.158,dozen of them two hours together. I have 'scaped by
1162,Henry IV,60,2.4.159,miracle. I am eight times thrust through the
1163,Henry IV,60,2.4.160,"doublet, four through the hose, my buckler cut"
1164,Henry IV,60,2.4.161,"through and through, my sword hacked like a"

1166,Henry IV,60,2.4.163,I was a man: all would not do. A plague of all
1167,Henry IV,60,2.4.164,cowards! Let them speak: if they speak more or
1168,Henry IV,60,2.4.165,"less than truth, they are villains and the sons of darkness."
1169,Henry IV,61,2.4.166,"Speak, sirs, how was it?"
1170,Henry IV,62,2.4.167,We four set upon some dozen--
1171,Henry IV,63,2.4.168,"Sixteen at least, my lord."
1172,Henry IV,64,2.4.169,And bound them.
1173,Henry IV,65,2.4.170,"No, no, they were not bound."
1174,Henry IV,66,2.4.171,"You rogue, they were bound, every man of them, or I"

1176,Henry IV,67,2.4.173,"As we were sharing, some six or seven fresh men set upon us--"
1177,Henry IV,68,2.4.174,"And unbound the rest, and then come in the other."
1178,Henry IV,69,2.4.175,"What, fought you with them all?"
1179,Henry IV,70,2.4.176,"All! I know not what you call all, but if I fought"
1180,Henry IV,70,2.4.177,"not with fifty of them, I am a bunch of radish: if"
1181,Henry IV,70,2.4.178,there were not two or three and fifty upon poor old
1182,Henry IV,70,2.4.179,"Jack, then am I no two-legged creature."
1183,Henry IV,71,2.4.180,Pray God you have not murdered some of them.
1184,Henry IV,72,2.4.181,"Nay, that's past praying for: I have peppered two"
1185,Henry IV,72,2.4.182,"of them, two I am sure I have paid, two rogues"
1186,Henry IV,72,2.4.183,"in buckram suits. I tell thee what, Hal, if I tell"
1187,Henry IV,72,2.4.184,"thee a lie, spit in my face, call me horse. Thou"
1188,Henry IV,72,2.4.185,"knowest my old ward, here I lay and thus I bore my"
1189,Henry IV,72,2.4.186,point. Four rogues in buckram let drive at me--
1190,Henry IV,73,2.4.187,"What, four? thou saidst but two even now."
1191,Henry IV,74,2.4.188,"Four, Hal, I told thee four."
1192,Henry IV,75,2.4.189,"Ay, ay, he said four."
1193,Henry IV,76,2.4.190,"These four came all a-front, and mainly thrust at"
1194,Henry IV,76,2.4.191,me. I made me no more ado but took all their seven

1196,Henry IV,77,2.4.193,"Seven? why, there were but four even now."
1197,Henry IV,78,2.4.194,In buckram?
1198,Henry IV,79,2.4.195,"Ay, four, in buckram suits."
1199,Henry IV,80,2.4.196,"Seven, by these hilts, or I am a villain else."
1200,Henry IV,81,2.4.197,"Prithee, let him alone, we shall have more anon."
1201,Henry IV,82,2.4.198,"Dost thou hear me, Hal?"
1202,Henry IV,83,2.4.199,"Ay, and mark thee too, Jack."
1203,Henry IV,84,2.4.200,"Do so, for it is worth the listening to. These nine"
1204,Henry IV,84,2.4.201,in buckram that I told thee of--
1205,Henry IV,85,2.4.202,"So, two more already."
1206,Henry IV,86,2.4.203,"Their points being broken,--"
1207,Henry IV,87,2.4.204,Down fell their hose.
1208,Henry IV,88,2.4.205,"Began to give me ground: but I followed me close,"
1209,Henry IV,88,2.4.206,"came in foot and hand, and with a thought seven of"
1210,Henry IV,88,2.4.207,the eleven I paid.
1211,Henry IV,89,2.4.208,O monstrous! eleven buckram men grown out of two!
1212,Henry IV,90,2.4.209,"But, as the devil would have it, three misbegotten"

1216,Henry IV,91,2.4.213,"These lies are like their father that begets them,"
1217,Henry IV,91,2.4.214,"gross as a mountain, open, palpable. Why, thou"

1221,Henry IV,92,2.4.218,the truth?
1222,Henry IV,93,2.4.219,"Why, how couldst thou know these men in Kendal"
1223,Henry IV,93,2.4.220,"green, when it was so dark thou couldst not see thy"
1224,Henry IV,93,2.4.221,"hand? come, tell us your reason: what sayest thou to this?"
1225,Henry IV,94,2.4.222,"Come, your reason, Jack, your reason."
1226,Henry IV,95,2.4.223,"What, upon compulsion? 'Zounds, an I were at the"
1227,Henry IV,95,2.4.224,"strappado, or all the racks in the world, I would"
1228,Henry IV,95,2.4.225,not tell you on compulsion. Give you a reason on
1229,Henry IV,95,2.4.226,compulsion! If reasons were as plentiful as

1259,Henry IV,102,2.4.256,"Why, hear you, my masters: was it for me to kill the"

1261,Henry IV,102,2.4.258,"why, thou knowest I am as valiant as Hercules: but"
1262,Henry IV,102,2.4.259,"beware instinct, the lion will not touch the true"
1263,Henry IV,102,2.4.260,"prince. Instinct is a great matter, I was now a"

1299,Henry IV,117,2.4.294,"believe it was done in fight, and persuaded us to do the like."
1300,Henry IV,118,2.4.295,"Yea, and to tickle our noses with spear-grass to"

1306,Henry IV,119,2.4.301,"ago, and wert taken with the manner, and ever since"
1307,Henry IV,119,2.4.302,thou hast blushed extempore. Thou hadst fire and
1308,Henry IV,119,2.4.303,"sword on thy side, and yet thou rannest away: what"
1309,Henry IV,119,2.4.304,instinct hadst thou for it?
1310,Henry IV,120,2.4.305,"My lord, do you see these meteors? do you behold"
1311,Henry IV,120,2.4.306,these exhalations?
1312,Henry IV,121,2.4.307,I do.
1313,Henry IV,122,2.4.308,What think you they portend?
1314,Henry IV,123,2.4.309,Hot livers and cold purses.
1315,Henry IV,124,2.4.310,"Choler, my lord, if rightly taken."

1320,Henry IV,125,2.4.314,"How long is't ago, Jack, since thou sawest thine own knee?"
1321,Henry IV,126,2.4.315,"My own knee! when I was about thy years, Hal, I was"
1322,Henry IV,126,2.4.316,"not an eagle's talon in the waist, I could have"
1323,Henry IV,126,2.4.317,crept into any alderman's thumb-ring: a plague of
1324,Henry IV,126,2.4.318,sighing and grief! it blows a man up like a
1325,Henry IV,126,2.4.319,bladder. There's villanous news abroad: here was
1326,Henry IV,126,2.4.320,"Sir John Bracy from your father, you must to the"
1327,Henry IV,126,2.4.321,court in the morning. That same mad fellow of the
1328,Henry IV,126,2.4.322,"north, Percy, and he of Wales, that gave Amamon the"
1329,Henry IV,126,2.4.323,bastinado and made Lucifer cuckold and swore the
1330,Henry IV,126,2.4.324,devil his true liegeman upon the cross of a Welsh
1331,Henry IV,126,2.4.325,hook--what a plague call you him?
1332,Henry IV,127,2.4.326,"O, Glendower."
1333,Henry IV,128,2.4.327,"Owen, Owen, the same, and his son-in-law Mortimer,"
1334,Henry IV,128,2.4.328,"and old Northumberland, and that sprightly Scot of"
1335,Henry IV,128,2.4.329,"Scots, Douglas, that runs o' horseback up a hill"
1336,Henry IV,128,2.4.330,"perpendicular,--"
1337,Henry IV,129,2.4.331,He that rides at high speed and with his pistol
1338,Henry IV,129,2.4.332,kills a sparrow flying.
1339,Henry IV,130,2.4.333,You have hit it.
1340,Henry IV,131,2.4.334,So did he never the sparrow.
1341,Henry IV,132,2.4.335,"Well, that rascal hath good mettle in him, he will not run."
1342,Henry IV,133,2.4.336,"Why, what a rascal art thou then, to praise him so"
1343,Henry IV,133,2.4.337,for running!
1344,Henry IV,134,2.4.338,"O' horseback, ye cuckoo, but afoot he will not budge a foot."
1345,Henry IV,135,2.4.339,"Yes, Jack, upon instinct."
1346,Henry IV,136,2.4.340,"I grant ye, upon instinct. Well, he is there too,"
1347,Henry IV,136,2.4.341,"and one Mordake, and a thousand blue-caps more:"
1348,Henry IV,136,2.4.342,"Worcester is stolen away to-night, thy father's"
1349,Henry IV,136,2.4.343,beard is turned white with the news: you may buy
1350,Henry IV,136,2.4.344,land now as cheap as stinking mackerel.
1351,Henry IV,137,2.4.345,"Why, then, it is like, if there come a hot June and"
1352,Henry IV,137,2.4.346,"this civil buffeting hold, we shall buy maidenheads"
1353,Henry IV,137,2.4.347,"as they buy hob-nails, by the hundreds."
1354,Henry IV,138,2.4.348,"By the mass, lad, thou sayest true, it is like we"
1355,Henry IV,138,2.4.349,"shall have good trading that way. But tell me, Hal,"
1356,Henry IV,138,2.4.350,art not thou horrible afeard? thou being
1357,Henry IV,138,2.4.351,"heir-apparent, could the world pick thee out three"
1358,Henry IV,138,2.4.352,"such enemies again as that fiend Douglas, that"
1359,Henry IV,138,2.4.353,"spirit Percy, and that devil Glendower? Art thou"
1360,Henry IV,138,2.4.354,not horribly afraid? doth not thy blood thrill at
1361,Henry IV,138,2.4.355,it?
1362,Henry IV,139,2.4.356,"Not a whit, i' faith, I lack some of thy instinct."
1363,Henry IV,140,2.4.357,"Well, thou wert be horribly chid tomorrow when thou"
1364,Henry IV,140,2.4.358,"comest to thy father: if thou love me, practise an answer."
1365,Henry IV,141,2.4.359,"Do thou stand for my father, and examine me upon the"
1366,Henry IV,141,2.4.360,particulars of my life.
1367,Henry IV,142,2.4.361,"Shall I? content: this chair shall be my state,"
1368,Henry IV,142,2.4.362,"this dagger my sceptre, and this cushion my crown."
1369,Henry IV,143,2.4.363,"Thy state is taken for a joined-stool, thy golden"
1370,Henry IV,143,2.4.364,"sceptre for a leaden dagger, and thy precious rich"
1371,Henry IV,143,2.4.365,crown for a pitiful bald crown!
1372,Henry IV,144,2.4.366,"Well, an the fire of grace be not quite out of thee,"
1373,Henry IV,144,2.4.367,now shalt thou be moved. Give me a cup of sack to
1374,Henry IV,144,2.4.368,"make my eyes look red, that it may be thought I have"
1375,Henry IV,144,2.4.369,"wept, for I must speak in passion, and I will do it"
1376,Henry IV,144,2.4.370,in King Cambyses' vein.
1377,Henry IV,145,2.4.371,"Well, here is my leg."
1378,Henry IV,146,2.4.372,"And here is my speech. Stand aside, nobility."
1379,Henry IV,147,2.4.373,"O Jesu, this is excellent sport, i' faith!"
1380,Henry IV,148,2.4.374,"Weep not, sweet queen, for trickling tears are vain."
1381,Henry IV,149,2.4.375,"O, the father, how he holds his countenance!"
1382,Henry IV,150,2.4.376,"For God's sake, lords, convey my tristful queen,"
1383,Henry IV,150,2.4.377,For tears do stop the flood-gates of her eyes.
1384,Henry IV,151,2.4.378,"O Jesu, he doth it as like one of these harlotry"
1385,Henry IV,151,2.4.379,players as ever I see!
1386,Henry IV,152,2.4.380,"Peace, good pint-pot, peace, good tickle-brain."
1387,Henry IV,152,2.4.381,"Harry, I do not only marvel where thou spendest thy"
1388,Henry IV,152,2.4.382,"time, but also how thou art accompanied: for though"
1389,Henry IV,152,2.4.383,"the camomile, the more it is trodden on the faster"
1390,Henry IV,152,2.4.384,"it grows, yet youth, the more it is wasted the"
1391,Henry IV,152,2.4.385,"sooner it wears. That thou art my son, I have"
1392,Henry IV,152,2.4.386,"partly thy mother's word, partly my own opinion,"
1393,Henry IV,152,2.4.387,but chiefly a villanous trick of thine eye and a
1394,Henry IV,152,2.4.388,"foolish-hanging of thy nether lip, that doth warrant"
1395,Henry IV,152,2.4.389,"me. If then thou be son to me, here lies the point,"
1396,Henry IV,152,2.4.390,"why, being son to me, art thou so pointed at? Shall"
1397,Henry IV,152,2.4.391,the blessed sun of heaven prove a micher and eat
1398,Henry IV,152,2.4.392,blackberries? a question not to be asked. Shall
1399,Henry IV,152,2.4.393,the sun of England prove a thief and take purses? a
1400,Henry IV,152,2.4.394,"question to be asked. There is a thing, Harry,"
1401,Henry IV,152,2.4.395,which thou hast often heard of and it is known to
1402,Henry IV,152,2.4.396,"many in our land by the name of pitch: this pitch,"
1403,Henry IV,152,2.4.397,"as ancient writers do report, doth defile, so doth"
1404,Henry IV,152,2.4.398,"the company thou keepest: for, Harry, now I do not"
1405,Henry IV,152,2.4.399,"speak to thee in drink but in tears, not in"
1406,Henry IV,152,2.4.400,"pleasure but in passion, not in words only, but in"
1407,Henry IV,152,2.4.401,woes also: and yet there is a virtuous man whom I
1408,Henry IV,152,2.4.402,"have often noted in thy company, but I know not his name."
1409,Henry IV,153,2.4.403,"What manner of man, an it like your majesty?"
1410,Henry IV,154,2.4.404,"A goodly portly man, i' faith, and a corpulent, of a"
1411,Henry IV,154,2.4.405,"cheerful look, a pleasing eye and a most noble"
1412,Henry IV,154,2.4.406,"carriage, and, as I think, his age some fifty, or,"
1413,Henry IV,154,2.4.407,"by'r lady, inclining to three score, and now I"
1414,Henry IV,154,2.4.408,"remember me, his name is Falstaff: if that man"
1415,Henry IV,154,2.4.409,"should be lewdly given, he deceiveth me, for, Harry,"
1416,Henry IV,154,2.4.410,I see virtue in his looks. If then the tree may be
1417,Henry IV,154,2.4.411,"known by the fruit, as the fruit by the tree, then,"
1418,Henry IV,154,2.4.412,"peremptorily I speak it, there is virtue in that"
1419,Henry IV,154,2.4.413,"Falstaff: him keep with, the rest banish. And tell"
1420,Henry IV,154,2.4.414,"me now, thou naughty varlet, tell me, where hast"
1421,Henry IV,154,2.4.415,thou been this month?
1422,Henry IV,155,2.4.416,"Dost thou speak like a king? Do thou stand for me,"
1423,Henry IV,155,2.4.417,and I'll play my father.
1424,Henry IV,156,2.4.418,"Depose me? if thou dost it half so gravely, so"
1425,Henry IV,156,2.4.419,"majestically, both in word and matter, hang me up by"
1426,Henry IV,156,2.4.420,the heels for a rabbit-sucker or a poulter's hare.
1427,Henry IV,157,2.4.421,"Well, here I am set."
1428,Henry IV,158,2.4.422,"And here I stand: judge, my masters."
1429,Henry IV,159,2.4.423,"Now, Harry, whence come you?"
1430,Henry IV,160,2.4.424,"My noble lord, from Eastcheap."
1431,Henry IV,161,2.4.425,The complaints I hear of thee are grievous.
1432,Henry IV,162,2.4.426,"'Sblood, my lord, they are false: nay, I'll tickle"
1433,Henry IV,162,2.4.427,"ye for a young prince, i' faith."
1434,Henry IV,163,2.4.428,"Swearest thou, ungracious boy? henceforth ne'er look"
1435,Henry IV,163,2.4.429,on me. Thou art violently carried away from grace:
1436,Henry IV,163,2.4.430,there is a devil haunts thee in the likeness of an
1437,Henry IV,163,2.4.431,"old fat man, a tun of man is thy companion. Why"
1438,Henry IV,163,2.4.432,"dost thou converse with that trunk of humours, that"
1439,Henry IV,163,2.4.433,"bolting-hutch of beastliness, that swollen parcel"
1440,Henry IV,163,2.4.434,"of dropsies, that huge bombard of sack, that stuffed"
1441,Henry IV,163,2.4.435,"cloak-bag of guts, that roasted Manningtree ox with"
1442,Henry IV,163,2.4.436,"the pudding in his belly, that reverend vice, that"
1443,Henry IV,163,2.4.437,"grey iniquity, that father ruffian, that vanity in"
1444,Henry IV,163,2.4.438,"years? Wherein is he good, but to taste sack and"
1445,Henry IV,163,2.4.439,"drink it? wherein neat and cleanly, but to carve a"
1446,Henry IV,163,2.4.440,"capon and eat it? wherein cunning, but in craft?"
1447,Henry IV,163,2.4.441,"wherein crafty, but in villany? wherein villanous,"
1448,Henry IV,163,2.4.442,"but in all things? wherein worthy, but in nothing?"
1449,Henry IV,164,2.4.443,I would your grace would take me with you: whom
1450,Henry IV,164,2.4.444,means your grace?
1451,Henry IV,165,2.4.445,"That villanous abominable misleader of youth,"
1452,Henry IV,165,2.4.446,"Falstaff, that old white-bearded Satan."
1453,Henry IV,166,2.4.447,"My lord, the man I know."
1454,Henry IV,167,2.4.448,I know thou dost.
1455,Henry IV,168,2.4.449,"But to say I know more harm in him than in myself,"
1456,Henry IV,168,2.4.450,"were to say more than I know. That he is old, the"
1457,Henry IV,168,2.4.451,"more the pity, his white hairs do witness it, but"
1458,Henry IV,168,2.4.452,"that he is, saving your reverence, a whoremaster,"
1459,Henry IV,168,2.4.453,"that I utterly deny. If sack and sugar be a fault,"
1460,Henry IV,168,2.4.454,God help the wicked! if to be old and merry be a
1461,Henry IV,168,2.4.455,"sin, then many an old host that I know is damned: if"
1462,Henry IV,168,2.4.456,"to be fat be to be hated, then Pharaoh's lean kine"
1463,Henry IV,168,2.4.457,"are to be loved. No, my good lord, banish Peto,"
1464,Henry IV,168,2.4.458,"banish Bardolph, banish Poins: but for sweet Jack"
1465,Henry IV,168,2.4.459,"Falstaff, kind Jack Falstaff, true Jack Falstaff,"
1466,Henry IV,168,2.4.460,"valiant Jack Falstaff, and therefore more valiant,"
1467,Henry IV,168,2.4.461,"being, as he is, old Jack Falstaff, banish not him"
1468,Henry IV,168,2.4.462,"thy Harry's company, banish not him thy Harry's"

1541,Henry IV,197,2.4.527,shall be honourable. I'll procure this fat rogue a
1542,Henry IV,197,2.4.528,"charge of foot, and I know his death will be a"
1543,Henry IV,197,2.4.529,march of twelve-score. The money shall be paid
1544,Henry IV,197,2.4.530,back again with advantage. Be with me betimes in
1545,Henry IV,197,2.4.531,"the morning, and so, good morrow, Peto."
1546,Henry IV,197,,Exeunt
1547,Henry IV,198,2.4.532,"Good morrow, good my lord."
1548,Henry IV,198,2.4.532,ACT III
1549,Henry IV,198,2.4.532,SCENE I. Bangor. The Archdeacon's house.
1550,Henry IV,198,,"Enter HOTSPUR, WORCESTER, MORTIMER, and GLENDOWER"
1551,Henry IV,1,3.1.1,"These promises are fair, the parties sure,"
1552,Henry IV,1,3.1.2,And our induction full of prosperous hope.
1553,Henry IV,2,3.1.3,"Lord Mortimer, and cousin Glendower,"
1554,Henry IV,2,3.1.4,Will you sit down?
1555,Henry IV,2,3.1.5,And uncle Worcester: a plague upon it!
1556,Henry IV,2,3.1.6,I have forgot the map.
1557,Henry IV,3,3.1.7,"No, here it is."
1558,Henry IV,3,3.1.8,"Sit, cousin Percy, sit, good cousin Hotspur,"
1559,Henry IV,3,3.1.9,For by that name as oft as Lancaster
1560,Henry IV,3,3.1.10,"Doth speak of you, his cheek looks pale and with"
1561,Henry IV,3,3.1.11,A rising sigh he wisheth you in heaven.
1562,Henry IV,4,3.1.12,"And you in hell, as oft as he hears Owen Glendower spoke of."
1563,Henry IV,5,3.1.13,I cannot blame him: at my nativity
1564,Henry IV,5,3.1.14,"The front of heaven was full of fiery shapes,"
1565,Henry IV,5,3.1.15,"Of burning cressets, and at my birth"
1566,Henry IV,5,3.1.16,The frame and huge foundation of the earth
1567,Henry IV,5,3.1.17,Shaked like a coward.
1568,Henry IV,6,3.1.18,"Why, so it would have done at the same season, if"
1569,Henry IV,6,3.1.19,"your mother's cat had but kittened, though yourself"
1570,Henry IV,6,3.1.20,had never been born.
1571,Henry IV,7,3.1.21,I say the earth did shake when I was born.
1572,Henry IV,8,3.1.22,"And I say the earth was not of my mind,"
1573,Henry IV,8,3.1.23,If you suppose as fearing you it shook.
1574,Henry IV,9,3.1.24,"The heavens were all on fire, the earth did tremble."
1575,Henry IV,10,3.1.25,"O, then the earth shook to see the heavens on fire,"
1576,Henry IV,10,3.1.26,And not in fear of your nativity.
1577,Henry IV,10,3.1.27,Diseased nature oftentimes breaks forth
1578,Henry IV,10,3.1.28,"In strange eruptions, oft the teeming earth"
1579,Henry IV,10,3.1.29,Is with a kind of colic pinch'd and vex'd
1580,Henry IV,10,3.1.30,By the imprisoning of unruly wind
1581,Henry IV,10,3.1.31,"Within her womb, which, for enlargement striving,"
1582,Henry IV,10,3.1.32,Shakes the old beldam earth and topples down
1583,Henry IV,10,3.1.33,Steeples and moss-grown towers. At your birth
1584,Henry IV,10,3.1.34,"Our grandam earth, having this distemperature,"
1585,Henry IV,10,3.1.35,In passion shook.
1586,Henry IV,11,3.1.36,"Cousin, of many men"
1587,Henry IV,11,3.1.37,I do not bear these crossings. Give me leave
1588,Henry IV,11,3.1.38,To tell you once again that at my birth
1589,Henry IV,11,3.1.39,"The front of heaven was full of fiery shapes,"
1590,Henry IV,11,3.1.40,"The goats ran from the mountains, and the herds"
1591,Henry IV,11,3.1.41,Were strangely clamorous to the frighted fields.
1592,Henry IV,11,3.1.42,"These signs have mark'd me extraordinary,"
1593,Henry IV,11,3.1.43,And all the courses of my life do show
1594,Henry IV,11,3.1.44,I am not in the roll of common men.
1595,Henry IV,11,3.1.45,"Where is he living, clipp'd in with the sea"
1596,Henry IV,11,3.1.46,"That chides the banks of England, Scotland, Wales,"
1597,Henry IV,11,3.1.47,"Which calls me pupil, or hath read to me?"
1598,Henry IV,11,3.1.48,And bring him out that is but woman's son
1599,Henry IV,11,3.1.49,Can trace me in the tedious ways of art
1600,Henry IV,11,3.1.50,And hold me pace in deep experiments.
1601,Henry IV,12,3.1.51,I think there's no man speaks better Welsh.
1602,Henry IV,12,3.1.52,I'll to dinner.
1603,Henry IV,13,3.1.53,"Peace, cousin Percy, you will make him mad."
1604,Henry IV,14,3.1.54,I can call spirits from the vasty deep.
1605,Henry IV,15,3.1.55,"Why, so can I, or so can any man,"
1606,Henry IV,15,3.1.56,But will they come when you do call for them?
1607,Henry IV,16,3.1.57,"Why, I can teach you, cousin, to command"
1608,Henry IV,16,3.1.58,The devil.
1609,Henry IV,17,3.1.59,"And I can teach thee, coz, to shame the devil"
1610,Henry IV,17,3.1.60,By telling truth: tell truth and shame the devil.
1611,Henry IV,17,3.1.61,"If thou have power to raise him, bring him hither,"
1612,Henry IV,17,3.1.62,And I'll be sworn I have power to shame him hence.
1613,Henry IV,17,3.1.63,"O, while you live, tell truth and shame the devil!"
1614,Henry IV,18,3.1.64,"Come, come, no more of this unprofitable chat."
1615,Henry IV,19,3.1.65,Three times hath Henry Bolingbroke made head
1616,Henry IV,19,3.1.66,"Against my power, thrice from the banks of Wye"
1617,Henry IV,19,3.1.67,And sandy-bottom'd Severn have I sent him
1618,Henry IV,19,3.1.68,Bootless home and weather-beaten back.
1619,Henry IV,20,3.1.69,"Home without boots, and in foul weather too!"
1620,Henry IV,20,3.1.70,"How 'scapes he agues, in the devil's name?"
1621,Henry IV,21,3.1.71,"Come, here's the map: shall we divide our right"
1622,Henry IV,21,3.1.72,According to our threefold order ta'en?
1623,Henry IV,22,3.1.73,The archdeacon hath divided it
1624,Henry IV,22,3.1.74,Into three limits very equally:
1625,Henry IV,22,3.1.75,"England, from Trent and Severn hitherto,"
1626,Henry IV,22,3.1.76,By south and east is to my part assign'd:
1627,Henry IV,22,3.1.77,"All westward, Wales beyond the Severn shore,"
1628,Henry IV,22,3.1.78,"And all the fertile land within that bound,"
1629,Henry IV,22,3.1.79,"To Owen Glendower: and, dear coz, to you"
1630,Henry IV,22,3.1.80,"The remnant northward, lying off from Trent."
1631,Henry IV,22,3.1.81,"And our indentures tripartite are drawn,"
1632,Henry IV,22,3.1.82,"Which being sealed interchangeably,"
1633,Henry IV,22,3.1.83,"A business that this night may execute,"
1634,Henry IV,22,3.1.84,"To-morrow, cousin Percy, you and I"
1635,Henry IV,22,3.1.85,And my good Lord of Worcester will set forth
1636,Henry IV,22,3.1.86,"To meet your father and the Scottish power,"
1637,Henry IV,22,3.1.87,"As is appointed us, at Shrewsbury."
1638,Henry IV,22,3.1.88,"My father Glendower is not ready yet,"
1639,Henry IV,22,3.1.89,Not shall we need his help these fourteen days.
1640,Henry IV,22,3.1.90,Within that space you may have drawn together
1641,Henry IV,22,3.1.91,"Your tenants, friends and neighbouring gentlemen."
1642,Henry IV,23,3.1.92,"A shorter time shall send me to you, lords:"
1643,Henry IV,23,3.1.93,"And in my conduct shall your ladies come,"
1644,Henry IV,23,3.1.94,"From whom you now must steal and take no leave,"
1645,Henry IV,23,3.1.95,For there will be a world of water shed
1646,Henry IV,23,3.1.96,Upon the parting of your wives and you.
1647,Henry IV,24,3.1.97,"Methinks my moiety, north from Burton here,"
1648,Henry IV,24,3.1.98,In quantity equals not one of yours:
1649,Henry IV,24,3.1.99,"See how this river comes me cranking in,"
1650,Henry IV,24,3.1.100,And cuts me from the best of all my land
1651,Henry IV,24,3.1.101,"A huge half-moon, a monstrous cantle out."
1652,Henry IV,24,3.1.102,"I'll have the current in this place damm'd up,"
1653,Henry IV,24,3.1.103,And here the smug and silver Trent shall run
1654,Henry IV,24,3.1.104,"In a new channel, fair and evenly,"
1655,Henry IV,24,3.1.105,"It shall not wind with such a deep indent,"
1656,Henry IV,24,3.1.106,To rob me of so rich a bottom here.
1657,Henry IV,25,3.1.107,"Not wind? it shall, it must, you see it doth."
1658,Henry IV,26,3.1.108,"Yea, but"
1659,Henry IV,26,3.1.109,"Mark how he bears his course, and runs me up"
1660,Henry IV,26,3.1.110,"With like advantage on the other side,"
1661,Henry IV,26,3.1.111,Gelding the opposed continent as much
1662,Henry IV,26,3.1.112,As on the other side it takes from you.
1663,Henry IV,27,3.1.113,"Yea, but a little charge will trench him here"
1664,Henry IV,27,3.1.114,"And on this north side win this cape of land,"
1665,Henry IV,27,3.1.115,And then he runs straight and even.
1666,Henry IV,28,3.1.116,I'll have it so: a little charge will do it.
1667,Henry IV,29,3.1.117,I'll not have it alter'd.
1668,Henry IV,30,3.1.118,Will not you?
1669,Henry IV,31,3.1.119,"No, nor you shall not."
1670,Henry IV,32,3.1.120,Who shall say me nay?
1671,Henry IV,33,3.1.121,"Why, that will I."
1672,Henry IV,34,3.1.122,"Let me not understand you, then, speak it in Welsh."
1673,Henry IV,35,3.1.123,"I can speak English, lord, as well as you,"
1674,Henry IV,35,3.1.124,"For I was train'd up in the English court,"
1675,Henry IV,35,3.1.125,"Where, being but young, I framed to the harp"
1676,Henry IV,35,3.1.126,Many an English ditty lovely well
1677,Henry IV,35,3.1.127,"And gave the tongue a helpful ornament,"
1678,Henry IV,35,3.1.128,A virtue that was never seen in you.
1679,Henry IV,36,3.1.129,"Marry,"
1680,Henry IV,36,3.1.130,And I am glad of it with all my heart:
1681,Henry IV,36,3.1.131,I had rather be a kitten and cry mew
1682,Henry IV,36,3.1.132,"Than one of these same metre ballad-mongers,"
1683,Henry IV,36,3.1.133,"I had rather hear a brazen canstick turn'd,"
1684,Henry IV,36,3.1.134,"Or a dry wheel grate on the axle-tree,"
1685,Henry IV,36,3.1.135,"And that would set my teeth nothing on edge,"
1686,Henry IV,36,3.1.136,Nothing so much as mincing poetry:
1687,Henry IV,36,3.1.137,'Tis like the forced gait of a shuffling nag.
1688,Henry IV,37,3.1.138,"Come, you shall have Trent turn'd."
1689,Henry IV,38,3.1.139,I do not care: I'll give thrice so much land
1690,Henry IV,38,3.1.140,"To any well-deserving friend,"
1691,Henry IV,38,3.1.141,"But in the way of bargain, mark ye me,"
1692,Henry IV,38,3.1.142,I'll cavil on the ninth part of a hair.
1693,Henry IV,38,3.1.143,Are the indentures drawn? shall we be gone?
1694,Henry IV,39,3.1.144,"The moon shines fair, you may away by night:"
1695,Henry IV,39,3.1.145,I'll haste the writer and withal
1696,Henry IV,39,3.1.146,Break with your wives of your departure hence:
1697,Henry IV,39,3.1.147,"I am afraid my daughter will run mad,"
1698,Henry IV,39,3.1.148,So much she doteth on her Mortimer.
1699,Henry IV,39,,Exit GLENDOWER
1700,Henry IV,40,3.1.149,"Fie, cousin Percy! how you cross my father!"
1701,Henry IV,41,3.1.150,I cannot choose: sometime he angers me
1702,Henry IV,41,3.1.151,"With telling me of the mouldwarp and the ant,"
1703,Henry IV,41,3.1.152,"Of the dreamer Merlin and his prophecies,"
1704,Henry IV,41,3.1.153,"And of a dragon and a finless fish,"
1705,Henry IV,41,3.1.154,"A clip-wing'd griffin and a moulten raven,"
1706,Henry IV,41,3.1.155,"A couching lion and a ramping cat,"
1707,Henry IV,41,3.1.156,And such a deal of skimble-skamble stuff
1708,Henry IV,41,3.1.157,"As puts me from my faith. I tell you what,"
1709,Henry IV,41,3.1.158,He held me last night at least nine hours
1710,Henry IV,41,3.1.159,In reckoning up the several devils' names
1711,Henry IV,41,3.1.160,"That were his lackeys: I cried 'hum,' and 'well, go to,'"
1712,Henry IV,41,3.1.161,"But mark'd him not a word. O, he is as tedious"
1713,Henry IV,41,3.1.162,"As a tired horse, a railing wife,"
1714,Henry IV,41,3.1.163,Worse than a smoky house: I had rather live
1715,Henry IV,41,3.1.164,"With cheese and garlic in a windmill, far,"
1716,Henry IV,41,3.1.165,Than feed on cates and have him talk to me
1717,Henry IV,41,3.1.166,In any summer-house in Christendom.
1718,Henry IV,42,3.1.167,"In faith, he is a worthy gentleman,"
1719,Henry IV,42,3.1.168,"Exceedingly well read, and profited"
1720,Henry IV,42,3.1.169,"In strange concealments, valiant as a lion"
1721,Henry IV,42,3.1.170,And as wondrous affable and as bountiful
1722,Henry IV,42,3.1.171,"As mines of India. Shall I tell you, cousin?"
1723,Henry IV,42,3.1.172,He holds your temper in a high respect
1724,Henry IV,42,3.1.173,And curbs himself even of his natural scope
1725,Henry IV,42,3.1.174,"When you come 'cross his humour, faith, he does:"
1726,Henry IV,42,3.1.175,"I warrant you, that man is not alive"
1727,Henry IV,42,3.1.176,"Might so have tempted him as you have done,"
1728,Henry IV,42,3.1.177,Without the taste of danger and reproof:
1729,Henry IV,42,3.1.178,"But do not use it oft, let me entreat you."
1730,Henry IV,43,3.1.179,"In faith, my lord, you are too wilful-blame,"
1731,Henry IV,43,3.1.180,And since your coming hither have done enough
1732,Henry IV,43,3.1.181,To put him quite beside his patience.
1733,Henry IV,43,3.1.182,"You must needs learn, lord, to amend this fault:"
1734,Henry IV,43,3.1.183,"Though sometimes it show greatness, courage, blood,--"
1735,Henry IV,43,3.1.184,"And that's the dearest grace it renders you,--"
1736,Henry IV,43,3.1.185,"Yet oftentimes it doth present harsh rage,"
1737,Henry IV,43,3.1.186,"Defect of manners, want of government,"
1738,Henry IV,43,3.1.187,"Pride, haughtiness, opinion and disdain:"
1739,Henry IV,43,3.1.188,The least of which haunting a nobleman
1740,Henry IV,43,3.1.189,Loseth men's hearts and leaves behind a stain
1741,Henry IV,43,3.1.190,"Upon the beauty of all parts besides,"
1742,Henry IV,43,3.1.191,Beguiling them of commendation.
1743,Henry IV,44,3.1.192,"Well, I am school'd: good manners be your speed!"
1744,Henry IV,44,3.1.193,"Here come our wives, and let us take our leave."
1745,Henry IV,44,,Re-enter GLENDOWER with the ladies
1746,Henry IV,45,3.1.194,"This is the deadly spite that angers me,"
1747,Henry IV,45,3.1.195,"My wife can speak no English, I no Welsh."
1748,Henry IV,46,3.1.196,"My daughter weeps: she will not part with you,"
1749,Henry IV,46,3.1.197,"She'll be a soldier too, she'll to the wars."
1750,Henry IV,47,3.1.198,"Good father, tell her that she and my aunt Percy"
1751,Henry IV,47,3.1.199,Shall follow in your conduct speedily.
1752,Henry IV,47,,"Glendower speaks to her in Welsh, and she answers him in the same"
1753,Henry IV,48,3.1.200,"She is desperate here, a peevish self-wind harlotry,"
1754,Henry IV,48,3.1.201,one that no persuasion can do good upon.
1755,Henry IV,48,,The lady speaks in Welsh
1756,Henry IV,49,3.1.202,I understand thy looks: that pretty Welsh
1757,Henry IV,49,3.1.203,Which thou pour'st down from these swelling heavens
1758,Henry IV,49,3.1.204,"I am too perfect in, and, but for shame,"
1759,Henry IV,49,3.1.205,In such a parley should I answer thee.
1760,Henry IV,49,,The lady speaks again in Welsh
1761,Henry IV,49,3.1.206,"I understand thy kisses and thou mine,"
1762,Henry IV,49,3.1.207,And that's a feeling disputation:
1763,Henry IV,49,3.1.208,"But I will never be a truant, love,"
1764,Henry IV,49,3.1.209,"Till I have learned thy language, for thy tongue"
1765,Henry IV,49,3.1.210,"Makes Welsh as sweet as ditties highly penn'd,"
1766,Henry IV,49,3.1.211,"Sung by a fair queen in a summer's bower,"
1767,Henry IV,49,3.1.212,"With ravishing division, to her lute."
1768,Henry IV,50,3.1.213,"Nay, if you melt, then will she run mad."
1769,Henry IV,50,,The lady speaks again in Welsh
1770,Henry IV,51,3.1.214,"O, I am ignorance itself in this!"
1771,Henry IV,52,3.1.215,She bids you on the wanton rushes lay you down
1772,Henry IV,52,3.1.216,"And rest your gentle head upon her lap,"
1773,Henry IV,52,3.1.217,And she will sing the song that pleaseth you
1774,Henry IV,52,3.1.218,And on your eyelids crown the god of sleep.
1775,Henry IV,52,3.1.219,"Charming your blood with pleasing heaviness,"
1776,Henry IV,52,3.1.220,Making such difference 'twixt wake and sleep
1777,Henry IV,52,3.1.221,As is the difference betwixt day and night
1778,Henry IV,52,3.1.222,The hour before the heavenly-harness'd team
1779,Henry IV,52,3.1.223,Begins his golden progress in the east.
1780,Henry IV,53,3.1.224,With all my heart I'll sit and hear her sing:
1781,Henry IV,53,3.1.225,"By that time will our book, I think, be drawn"
1782,Henry IV,54,3.1.226,"Do so,"
1783,Henry IV,54,3.1.227,And those musicians that shall play to you
1784,Henry IV,54,3.1.228,"Hang in the air a thousand leagues from hence,"
1785,Henry IV,54,3.1.229,"And straight they shall be here: sit, and attend."
1786,Henry IV,55,3.1.230,"Come, Kate, thou art perfect in lying down: come,"
1787,Henry IV,55,3.1.231,"quick, quick, that I may lay my head in thy lap."
1788,Henry IV,56,3.1.232,"Go, ye giddy goose."
1789,Henry IV,56,,The music plays
1790,Henry IV,57,3.1.233,"Now I perceive the devil understands Welsh,"
1791,Henry IV,57,3.1.234,And 'tis no marvel he is so humorous.
1792,Henry IV,57,3.1.235,"By'r lady, he is a good musician."
1793,Henry IV,58,3.1.236,Then should you be nothing but musical for you are
1794,Henry IV,58,3.1.237,"altogether governed by humours. Lie still, ye thief,"
1795,Henry IV,58,3.1.238,and hear the lady sing in Welsh.
1796,Henry IV,59,3.1.239,"I had rather hear Lady, my brach, howl in Irish."
1797,Henry IV,60,3.1.240,Wouldst thou have thy head broken?
1798,Henry IV,61,3.1.241,No.
1799,Henry IV,62,3.1.242,Then be still.
1800,Henry IV,63,3.1.243,"Neither,'tis a woman's fault."
1801,Henry IV,64,3.1.244,Now God help thee!
1802,Henry IV,65,3.1.245,To the Welsh lady's bed.
1803,Henry IV,66,3.1.246,What's that?
1804,Henry IV,67,3.1.247,Peace! she sings.
1805,Henry IV,67,,Here the lady sings a Welsh song
1806,Henry IV,68,3.1.248,"Come, Kate, I'll have your song too."
1807,Henry IV,69,3.1.249,"Not mine, in good sooth."
1808,Henry IV,70,3.1.250,"Not yours, in good sooth! Heart! you swear like a"
1809,Henry IV,70,3.1.251,"comfit-maker's wife. 'Not you, in good sooth,' and"
1810,Henry IV,70,3.1.252,"'as true as I live,' and 'as God shall mend me,' and"
1811,Henry IV,70,3.1.253,"'as sure as day,'"
1812,Henry IV,70,3.1.254,"And givest such sarcenet surety for thy oaths,"
1813,Henry IV,70,3.1.255,As if thou never walk'st further than Finsbury.
1814,Henry IV,70,3.1.256,"Swear me, Kate, like a lady as thou art,"
1815,Henry IV,70,3.1.257,"A good mouth-filling oath, and leave 'in sooth,'"
1816,Henry IV,70,3.1.258,"And such protest of pepper-gingerbread,"
1817,Henry IV,70,3.1.259,To velvet-guards and Sunday-citizens.
1818,Henry IV,70,3.1.260,"Come, sing."
1819,Henry IV,71,3.1.261,I will not sing.
1820,Henry IV,72,3.1.262,"'Tis the next way to turn tailor, or be red-breast"
1821,Henry IV,72,3.1.263,"teacher. An the indentures be drawn, I'll away"
1822,Henry IV,72,3.1.264,"within these two hours, and so, come in when ye will."
1823,Henry IV,72,,Exit
1824,Henry IV,73,3.1.265,"Come, come, Lord Mortimer, you are as slow"
1825,Henry IV,73,3.1.266,As hot Lord Percy is on fire to go.
1826,Henry IV,73,3.1.267,"By this our book is drawn, we'll but seal,"
1827,Henry IV,73,3.1.268,And then to horse immediately.
1828,Henry IV,74,3.1.269,With all my heart.
1829,Henry IV,74,,Exeunt
1830,Henry IV,74,,SCENE II. London. The palace.
1831,Henry IV,74,,"Enter KING HENRY IV, PRINCE HENRY, and others"
1832,Henry IV,1,3.2.1,"Lords, give us leave, the Prince of Wales and I"
1833,Henry IV,1,3.2.2,"Must have some private conference, but be near at hand,"
1834,Henry IV,1,3.2.3,For we shall presently have need of you.
1835,Henry IV,1,,Exeunt Lords
1836,Henry IV,1,3.2.4,"I know not whether God will have it so,"
1837,Henry IV,1,3.2.5,"For some displeasing service I have done,"
1838,Henry IV,1,3.2.6,"That, in his secret doom, out of my blood"
1839,Henry IV,1,3.2.7,"He'll breed revengement and a scourge for me,"
1840,Henry IV,1,3.2.8,But thou dost in thy passages of life
1841,Henry IV,1,3.2.9,Make me believe that thou art only mark'd
1842,Henry IV,1,3.2.10,For the hot vengeance and the rod of heaven
1843,Henry IV,1,3.2.11,"To punish my mistreadings. Tell me else,"
1844,Henry IV,1,3.2.12,"Could such inordinate and low desires,"
1845,Henry IV,1,3.2.13,"Such poor, such bare, such lewd, such mean attempts,"
1846,Henry IV,1,3.2.14,"Such barren pleasures, rude society,"
1847,Henry IV,1,3.2.15,"As thou art match'd withal and grafted to,"
1848,Henry IV,1,3.2.16,Accompany the greatness of thy blood
1849,Henry IV,1,3.2.17,And hold their level with thy princely heart?
1850,Henry IV,2,3.2.18,"So please your majesty, I would I could"
1851,Henry IV,2,3.2.19,Quit all offences with as clear excuse
1852,Henry IV,2,3.2.20,As well as I am doubtless I can purge
1853,Henry IV,2,3.2.21,Myself of many I am charged withal:
1854,Henry IV,2,3.2.22,"Yet such extenuation let me beg,"
1855,Henry IV,2,3.2.23,"As, in reproof of many tales devised,"
1856,Henry IV,2,3.2.24,"which oft the ear of greatness needs must hear,"
1857,Henry IV,2,3.2.25,"By smiling pick-thanks and base news-mongers,"
1858,Henry IV,2,3.2.26,"I may, for some things true, wherein my youth"
1859,Henry IV,2,3.2.27,"Hath faulty wander'd and irregular,"
1860,Henry IV,2,3.2.28,Find pardon on my true submission.
1861,Henry IV,3,3.2.29,"God pardon thee! yet let me wonder, Harry,"
1862,Henry IV,3,3.2.30,"At thy affections, which do hold a wing"
1863,Henry IV,3,3.2.31,Quite from the flight of all thy ancestors.
1864,Henry IV,3,3.2.32,Thy place in council thou hast rudely lost.
1865,Henry IV,3,3.2.33,"Which by thy younger brother is supplied,"
1866,Henry IV,3,3.2.34,And art almost an alien to the hearts
1867,Henry IV,3,3.2.35,Of all the court and princes of my blood:
1868,Henry IV,3,3.2.36,The hope and expectation of thy time
1869,Henry IV,3,3.2.37,"Is ruin'd, and the soul of every man"
1870,Henry IV,3,3.2.38,Prophetically doth forethink thy fall.
1871,Henry IV,3,3.2.39,"Had I so lavish of my presence been,"
1872,Henry IV,3,3.2.40,"So common-hackney'd in the eyes of men,"
1873,Henry IV,3,3.2.41,"So stale and cheap to vulgar company,"
1874,Henry IV,3,3.2.42,"Opinion, that did help me to the crown,"
1875,Henry IV,3,3.2.43,Had still kept loyal to possession
1876,Henry IV,3,3.2.44,"And left me in reputeless banishment,"
1877,Henry IV,3,3.2.45,A fellow of no mark nor likelihood.
1878,Henry IV,3,3.2.46,"By being seldom seen, I could not stir"
1879,Henry IV,3,3.2.47,"But like a comet I was wonder'd at,"
1880,Henry IV,3,3.2.48,"That men would tell their children 'This is he,'"
1881,Henry IV,3,3.2.49,"Others would say 'Where, which is Bolingbroke?'"
1882,Henry IV,3,3.2.50,"And then I stole all courtesy from heaven,"
1883,Henry IV,3,3.2.51,And dress'd myself in such humility
1884,Henry IV,3,3.2.52,"That I did pluck allegiance from men's hearts,"
1885,Henry IV,3,3.2.53,"Loud shouts and salutations from their mouths,"
1886,Henry IV,3,3.2.54,Even in the presence of the crowned king.
1887,Henry IV,3,3.2.55,"Thus did I keep my person fresh and new,"
1888,Henry IV,3,3.2.56,"My presence, like a robe pontifical,"
1889,Henry IV,3,3.2.57,"Ne'er seen but wonder'd at: and so my state,"
1890,Henry IV,3,3.2.58,"Seldom but sumptuous, showed like a feast"
1891,Henry IV,3,3.2.59,And won by rareness such solemnity.
1892,Henry IV,3,3.2.60,"The skipping king, he ambled up and down"
1893,Henry IV,3,3.2.61,"With shallow jesters and rash bavin wits,"
1894,Henry IV,3,3.2.62,"Soon kindled and soon burnt, carded his state,"
1895,Henry IV,3,3.2.63,"Mingled his royalty with capering fools,"
1896,Henry IV,3,3.2.64,Had his great name profaned with their scorns
1897,Henry IV,3,3.2.65,"And gave his countenance, against his name,"
1898,Henry IV,3,3.2.66,To laugh at gibing boys and stand the push
1899,Henry IV,3,3.2.67,"Of every beardless vain comparative,"
1900,Henry IV,3,3.2.68,"Grew a companion to the common streets,"
1901,Henry IV,3,3.2.69,"Enfeoff'd himself to popularity,"
1902,Henry IV,3,3.2.70,"That, being daily swallow'd by men's eyes,"
1903,Henry IV,3,3.2.71,They surfeited with honey and began
1904,Henry IV,3,3.2.72,"To loathe the taste of sweetness, whereof a little"
1905,Henry IV,3,3.2.73,More than a little is by much too much.
1906,Henry IV,3,3.2.74,"So when he had occasion to be seen,"
1907,Henry IV,3,3.2.75,"He was but as the cuckoo is in June,"
1908,Henry IV,3,3.2.76,"Heard, not regarded, seen, but with such eyes"
1909,Henry IV,3,3.2.77,"As, sick and blunted with community,"
1910,Henry IV,3,3.2.78,"Afford no extraordinary gaze,"
1911,Henry IV,3,3.2.79,Such as is bent on sun-like majesty
1912,Henry IV,3,3.2.80,"When it shines seldom in admiring eyes,"
1913,Henry IV,3,3.2.81,"But rather drowzed and hung their eyelids down,"
1914,Henry IV,3,3.2.82,Slept in his face and render'd such aspect
1915,Henry IV,3,3.2.83,"As cloudy men use to their adversaries,"
1916,Henry IV,3,3.2.84,"Being with his presence glutted, gorged and full."
1917,Henry IV,3,3.2.85,"And in that very line, Harry, standest thou,"
1918,Henry IV,3,3.2.86,For thou has lost thy princely privilege
1919,Henry IV,3,3.2.87,With vile participation: not an eye
1920,Henry IV,3,3.2.88,"But is a-weary of thy common sight,"
1921,Henry IV,3,3.2.89,"Save mine, which hath desired to see thee more,"
1922,Henry IV,3,3.2.90,"Which now doth that I would not have it do,"
1923,Henry IV,3,3.2.91,Make blind itself with foolish tenderness.
1924,Henry IV,4,3.2.92,"I shall hereafter, my thrice gracious lord,"
1925,Henry IV,4,3.2.93,Be more myself.
1926,Henry IV,5,3.2.94,For all the world
1927,Henry IV,5,3.2.95,As thou art to this hour was Richard then
1928,Henry IV,5,3.2.96,"When I from France set foot at Ravenspurgh,"
1929,Henry IV,5,3.2.97,And even as I was then is Percy now.
1930,Henry IV,5,3.2.98,"Now, by my sceptre and my soul to boot,"
1931,Henry IV,5,3.2.99,He hath more worthy interest to the state
1932,Henry IV,5,3.2.100,"Than thou the shadow of succession,"
1933,Henry IV,5,3.2.101,"For of no right, nor colour like to right,"
1934,Henry IV,5,3.2.102,"He doth fill fields with harness in the realm,"
1935,Henry IV,5,3.2.103,"Turns head against the lion's armed jaws,"
1936,Henry IV,5,3.2.104,"And, being no more in debt to years than thou,"
1937,Henry IV,5,3.2.105,Leads ancient lords and reverend bishops on
1938,Henry IV,5,3.2.106,To bloody battles and to bruising arms.
1939,Henry IV,5,3.2.107,What never-dying honour hath he got
1940,Henry IV,5,3.2.108,"Against renowned Douglas! whose high deeds,"
1941,Henry IV,5,3.2.109,Whose hot incursions and great name in arms
1942,Henry IV,5,3.2.110,Holds from all soldiers chief majority
1943,Henry IV,5,3.2.111,And military title capital
1944,Henry IV,5,3.2.112,Through all the kingdoms that acknowledge Christ:
1945,Henry IV,5,3.2.113,"Thrice hath this Hotspur, Mars in swathling clothes,"
1946,Henry IV,5,3.2.114,"This infant warrior, in his enterprises"
1947,Henry IV,5,3.2.115,"Discomfited great Douglas, ta'en him once,"
1948,Henry IV,5,3.2.116,"Enlarged him and made a friend of him,"
1949,Henry IV,5,3.2.117,To fill the mouth of deep defiance up
1950,Henry IV,5,3.2.118,And shake the peace and safety of our throne.
1951,Henry IV,5,3.2.119,"And what say you to this? Percy, Northumberland,"
1952,Henry IV,5,3.2.120,"The Archbishop's grace of York, Douglas, Mortimer,"
1953,Henry IV,5,3.2.121,Capitulate against us and are up.
1954,Henry IV,5,3.2.122,But wherefore do I tell these news to thee?
1955,Henry IV,5,3.2.123,"Why, Harry, do I tell thee of my foes,"
1956,Henry IV,5,3.2.124,Which art my near'st and dearest enemy?
1957,Henry IV,5,3.2.125,"Thou that art like enough, through vassal fear,"
1958,Henry IV,5,3.2.126,Base inclination and the start of spleen
1959,Henry IV,5,3.2.127,"To fight against me under Percy's pay,"
1960,Henry IV,5,3.2.128,"To dog his heels and curtsy at his frowns,"
1961,Henry IV,5,3.2.129,To show how much thou art degenerate.
1962,Henry IV,6,3.2.130,"Do not think so, you shall not find it so:"
1963,Henry IV,6,3.2.131,And God forgive them that so much have sway'd
1964,Henry IV,6,3.2.132,Your majesty's good thoughts away from me!
1965,Henry IV,6,3.2.133,I will redeem all this on Percy's head
1966,Henry IV,6,3.2.134,And in the closing of some glorious day
1967,Henry IV,6,3.2.135,"Be bold to tell you that I am your son,"
1968,Henry IV,6,3.2.136,When I will wear a garment all of blood
1969,Henry IV,6,3.2.137,"And stain my favours in a bloody mask,"
1970,Henry IV,6,3.2.138,"Which, wash'd away, shall scour my shame with it:"
1971,Henry IV,6,3.2.139,"And that shall be the day, whene'er it lights,"
1972,Henry IV,6,3.2.140,"That this same child of honour and renown,"
1973,Henry IV,6,3.2.141,"This gallant Hotspur, this all-praised knight,"
1974,Henry IV,6,3.2.142,And your unthought-of Harry chance to meet.
1975,Henry IV,6,3.2.143,"For every honour sitting on his helm,"
1976,Henry IV,6,3.2.144,"Would they were multitudes, and on my head"
1977,Henry IV,6,3.2.145,"My shames redoubled! for the time will come,"
1978,Henry IV,6,3.2.146,That I shall make this northern youth exchange
1979,Henry IV,6,3.2.147,His glorious deeds for my indignities.
1980,Henry IV,6,3.2.148,"Percy is but my factor, good my lord,"
1981,Henry IV,6,3.2.149,"To engross up glorious deeds on my behalf,"
1982,Henry IV,6,3.2.150,"And I will call him to so strict account,"
1983,Henry IV,6,3.2.151,"That he shall render every glory up,"
1984,Henry IV,6,3.2.152,"Yea, even the slightest worship of his time,"
1985,Henry IV,6,3.2.153,Or I will tear the reckoning from his heart.
1986,Henry IV,6,3.2.154,"This, in the name of God, I promise here:"
1987,Henry IV,6,3.2.155,"The which if He be pleased I shall perform,"
1988,Henry IV,6,3.2.156,I do beseech your majesty may salve
1989,Henry IV,6,3.2.157,The long-grown wounds of my intemperance:
1990,Henry IV,6,3.2.158,"If not, the end of life cancels all bands,"
1991,Henry IV,6,3.2.159,And I will die a hundred thousand deaths
1992,Henry IV,6,3.2.160,Ere break the smallest parcel of this vow.
1993,Henry IV,7,3.2.161,A hundred thousand rebels die in this:
1994,Henry IV,7,3.2.162,Thou shalt have charge and sovereign trust herein.
1995,Henry IV,7,,Enter BLUNT
1996,Henry IV,7,3.2.163,"How now, good Blunt? thy looks are full of speed."
1997,Henry IV,8,3.2.164,So hath the business that I come to speak of.
1998,Henry IV,8,3.2.165,Lord Mortimer of Scotland hath sent word
1999,Henry IV,8,3.2.166,That Douglas and the English rebels met
2000,Henry IV,8,3.2.167,The eleventh of this month at Shrewsbury
2001,Henry IV,8,3.2.168,"A mighty and a fearful head they are,"
2002,Henry IV,8,3.2.169,"If promises be kept on every hand,"
2003,Henry IV,8,3.2.170,As ever offer'd foul play in the state.
2004,Henry IV,9,3.2.171,"The Earl of Westmoreland set forth to-day,"
2005,Henry IV,9,3.2.172,"With him my son, Lord John of Lancaster,"
2006,Henry IV,9,3.2.173,For this advertisement is five days old:
2007,Henry IV,9,3.2.174,"On Wednesday next, Harry, you shall set forward,"
2008,Henry IV,9,3.2.175,On Thursday we ourselves will march: our meeting
2009,Henry IV,9,3.2.176,"Is Bridgenorth: and, Harry, you shall march"
2010,Henry IV,9,3.2.177,"Through Gloucestershire, by which account,"
2011,Henry IV,9,3.2.178,"Our business valued, some twelve days hence"
2012,Henry IV,9,3.2.179,Our general forces at Bridgenorth shall meet.
2013,Henry IV,9,3.2.180,"Our hands are full of business: let's away,"
2014,Henry IV,9,3.2.181,"Advantage feeds him fat, while men delay."
2015,Henry IV,9,,Exeunt
2016,Henry IV,10,,Eastcheap. The Boar's-Head Tavern.
2017,Henry IV,10,,Enter FALSTAFF and BARDOLPH
2018,Henry IV,11,3.2.183,"Bardolph, am I not fallen away vilely since this last"
2019,Henry IV,11,3.2.184,action? do I not bate? do I not dwindle? Why my
2020,Henry IV,11,3.2.185,skin hangs about me like an like an old lady's loose
2021,Henry IV,11,3.2.186,"gown, I am withered like an old apple-john. Well,"
2022,Henry IV,11,3.2.187,"I'll repent, and that suddenly, while I am in some"
2023,Henry IV,11,3.2.188,"liking, I shall be out of heart shortly, and then I"
2024,Henry IV,11,3.2.189,shall have no strength to repent. An I have not
2025,Henry IV,11,3.2.190,"forgotten what the inside of a church is made of, I"
2026,Henry IV,11,3.2.191,"am a peppercorn, a brewer's horse: the inside of a"
2027,Henry IV,11,3.2.192,"church! Company, villanous company, hath been the"
2028,Henry IV,11,3.2.193,spoil of me.
2029,Henry IV,12,3.2.194,"Sir John, you are so fretful, you cannot live long."
2030,Henry IV,13,3.2.195,"Why, there is it: come sing me a bawdy song, make"
2031,Henry IV,13,3.2.196,me merry. I was as virtuously given as a gentleman
2032,Henry IV,13,3.2.197,"need to be, virtuous enough, swore little, diced not"
2033,Henry IV,13,3.2.198,"above seven times a week, went to a bawdy-house once"
2034,Henry IV,13,3.2.199,"in a quarter--of an hour, paid money that I"
2035,Henry IV,13,3.2.200,"borrowed, three of four times, lived well and in"
2036,Henry IV,13,3.2.201,"good compass: and now I live out of all order, out"
2037,Henry IV,13,3.2.202,of all compass.
2038,Henry IV,14,3.2.203,"Why, you are so fat, Sir John, that you must needs"
2039,Henry IV,14,3.2.204,"be out of all compass, out of all reasonable"

2041,Henry IV,15,3.2.206,"Do thou amend thy face, and I'll amend my life:"
2042,Henry IV,15,3.2.207,"thou art our admiral, thou bearest the lantern in"

2049,Henry IV,17,3.2.214,"Dives that lived in purple, for there he is in his"

2051,Henry IV,17,3.2.216,"given to virtue, I would swear by thy face, my oath"
2052,Henry IV,17,3.2.217,"should be 'By this fire, that's God's angel:' but"
2053,Henry IV,17,3.2.218,"thou art altogether given over, and wert indeed, but"

2057,Henry IV,17,3.2.222,"hadst been an ignis fatuus or a ball of wildfire,"
2058,Henry IV,17,3.2.223,"there's no purchase in money. O, thou art a"
2059,Henry IV,17,3.2.224,"perpetual triumph, an everlasting bonfire-light!"
2060,Henry IV,17,3.2.225,Thou hast saved me a thousand marks in links and
2061,Henry IV,17,3.2.226,"torches, walking with thee in the night betwixt"
2062,Henry IV,17,3.2.227,tavern and tavern: but the sack that thou hast
2063,Henry IV,17,3.2.228,drunk me would have bought me lights as good cheap
2064,Henry IV,17,3.2.229,at the dearest chandler's in Europe. I have
2065,Henry IV,17,3.2.230,maintained that salamander of yours with fire any
2066,Henry IV,17,3.2.231,"time this two and thirty years, God reward me for"
2067,Henry IV,17,3.2.232,it!
2068,Henry IV,18,3.2.233,"'Sblood, I would my face were in your belly!"
2069,Henry IV,19,3.2.234,God-a-mercy! so should I be sure to be heart-burned.
2070,Henry IV,19,,Enter Hostess
2071,Henry IV,19,3.2.235,"How now, Dame Partlet the hen! have you inquired"
2072,Henry IV,19,3.2.236,yet who picked my pocket?
2073,Henry IV,20,3.2.237,"Why, Sir John, what do you think, Sir John? do you"
2074,Henry IV,20,3.2.238,"think I keep thieves in my house? I have searched,"
2075,Henry IV,20,3.2.239,"I have inquired, so has my husband, man by man, boy"
2076,Henry IV,20,3.2.240,"by boy, servant by servant: the tithe of a hair"
2077,Henry IV,20,3.2.241,was never lost in my house before.
2078,Henry IV,21,3.2.242,"Ye lie, hostess: Bardolph was shaved and lost many"
2079,Henry IV,21,3.2.243,"a hair, and I'll be sworn my pocket was picked. Go"
2080,Henry IV,21,3.2.244,"to, you are a woman, go."
2081,Henry IV,22,3.2.245,"Who, I? no, I defy thee: God's light, I was never"
2082,Henry IV,22,3.2.246,called so in mine own house before.
2083,Henry IV,23,3.2.247,"Go to, I know you well enough."
2084,Henry IV,24,3.2.248,"No, Sir John, You do not know me, Sir John. I know"
2085,Henry IV,24,3.2.249,"you, Sir John: you owe me money, Sir John, and now"
2086,Henry IV,24,3.2.250,you pick a quarrel to beguile me of it: I bought
2087,Henry IV,24,3.2.251,you a dozen of shirts to your back.
2088,Henry IV,25,3.2.252,"Dowlas, filthy dowlas: I have given them away to"
2089,Henry IV,25,3.2.253,"bakers' wives, and they have made bolters of them."
2090,Henry IV,26,3.2.254,"Now, as I am a true woman, holland of eight"
2091,Henry IV,26,3.2.255,"shillings an ell. You owe money here besides, Sir"
2092,Henry IV,26,3.2.256,"John, for your diet and by-drinkings, and money lent"
2093,Henry IV,26,3.2.257,"you, four and twenty pound."
2094,Henry IV,27,3.2.258,"He had his part of it, let him pay."
2095,Henry IV,28,3.2.259,"He? alas, he is poor, he hath nothing."
2096,Henry IV,29,3.2.260,"How! poor? look upon his face, what call you rich?"
2097,Henry IV,29,3.2.261,"let them coin his nose, let them coin his cheeks:"
2098,Henry IV,29,3.2.262,"Ill not pay a denier. What, will you make a younker"
2099,Henry IV,29,3.2.263,of me? shall I not take mine case in mine inn but I
2100,Henry IV,29,3.2.264,shall have my pocket picked? I have lost a
2101,Henry IV,29,3.2.265,seal-ring of my grandfather's worth forty mark.
2102,Henry IV,30,3.2.266,"O Jesu, I have heard the prince tell him, I know not"
2103,Henry IV,30,3.2.267,"how oft, that ring was copper!"
2104,Henry IV,31,3.2.268,"How! the prince is a Jack, a sneak-cup: 'sblood, an"
2105,Henry IV,31,3.2.269,"he were here, I would cudgel him like a dog, if he"
2106,Henry IV,31,3.2.270,would say so.
2107,Henry IV,31,,"Enter PRINCE HENRY and PETO, marching, and FALSTAFF meets them playing on his truncheon like a life"
2108,Henry IV,31,3.2.271,"How now, lad! is the wind in that door, i' faith?"
2109,Henry IV,31,3.2.272,must we all march?
2110,Henry IV,32,3.2.273,"Yea, two and two, Newgate fashion."
2111,Henry IV,33,3.2.274,"My lord, I pray you, hear me."
2112,Henry IV,34,3.2.275,"What sayest thou, Mistress Quickly? How doth thy"
2113,Henry IV,34,3.2.276,"husband? I love him well, he is an honest man."
2114,Henry IV,35,3.2.277,"Good my lord, hear me."
2115,Henry IV,36,3.2.278,"Prithee, let her alone, and list to me."
2116,Henry IV,37,3.2.279,"What sayest thou, Jack?"
2117,Henry IV,38,3.2.280,The other night I fell asleep here behind the arras
2118,Henry IV,38,3.2.281,and had my pocket picked: this house is turned
2119,Henry IV,38,3.2.282,"bawdy-house, they pick pockets."
2120,Henry IV,39,3.2.283,"What didst thou lose, Jack?"
2121,Henry IV,40,3.2.284,"Wilt thou believe me, Hal? three or four bonds of"
2122,Henry IV,40,3.2.285,"forty pound apiece, and a seal-ring of my"
2123,Henry IV,40,3.2.286,grandfather's.
2124,Henry IV,41,3.2.287,"A trifle, some eight-penny matter."
2125,Henry IV,42,3.2.288,"So I told him, my lord, and I said I heard your"
2126,Henry IV,42,3.2.289,"grace say so: and, my lord, he speaks most vilely"
2127,Henry IV,42,3.2.290,"of you, like a foul-mouthed man as he is, and said"
2128,Henry IV,42,3.2.291,he would cudgel you.
2129,Henry IV,43,3.2.292,What! he did not?
2130,Henry IV,44,3.2.293,"There's neither faith, truth, nor womanhood in me else."
2131,Henry IV,45,3.2.294,There's no more faith in thee than in a stewed
2132,Henry IV,45,3.2.295,"prune, nor no more truth in thee than in a drawn"
2133,Henry IV,45,3.2.296,"fox, and for womanhood, Maid Marian may be the"
2134,Henry IV,45,3.2.297,"deputy's wife of the ward to thee. Go, you thing,"
2135,Henry IV,45,3.2.298,go
2136,Henry IV,46,3.2.299,"Say, what thing? what thing?"
2137,Henry IV,47,3.2.300,"What thing! why, a thing to thank God on."
2138,Henry IV,48,3.2.301,"I am no thing to thank God on, I would thou"
2139,Henry IV,48,3.2.302,"shouldst know it, I am an honest man's wife: and,"
2140,Henry IV,48,3.2.303,"setting thy knighthood aside, thou art a knave to"
2141,Henry IV,48,3.2.304,call me so.
2142,Henry IV,49,3.2.305,"Setting thy womanhood aside, thou art a beast to say"
2143,Henry IV,49,3.2.306,otherwise.
2144,Henry IV,50,3.2.307,"Say, what beast, thou knave, thou?"
2145,Henry IV,51,3.2.308,"What beast! why, an otter."
2146,Henry IV,52,3.2.309,"An otter, Sir John! Why an otter?"
2147,Henry IV,53,3.2.310,"Why, she's neither fish nor flesh, a man knows not"
2148,Henry IV,53,3.2.311,where to have her.
2149,Henry IV,54,3.2.312,Thou art an unjust man in saying so: thou or any
2150,Henry IV,54,3.2.313,"man knows where to have me, thou knave, thou!"
2151,Henry IV,55,3.2.314,"Thou sayest true, hostess, and he slanders thee most grossly."
2152,Henry IV,56,3.2.315,"So he doth you, my lord, and said this other day you"
2153,Henry IV,56,3.2.316,ought him a thousand pound.
2154,Henry IV,57,3.2.317,"Sirrah, do I owe you a thousand pound?"
2155,Henry IV,58,3.2.318,"A thousand pound, Ha! a million: thy love is worth"
2156,Henry IV,58,3.2.319,a million: thou owest me thy love.
2157,Henry IV,59,3.2.320,"Nay, my lord, he called you Jack, and said he would"
2158,Henry IV,59,3.2.321,cudgel you.
2159,Henry IV,60,3.2.322,"Did I, Bardolph?"
2160,Henry IV,61,3.2.323,"Indeed, Sir John, you said so."
2161,Henry IV,62,3.2.324,"Yea, if he said my ring was copper."
2162,Henry IV,63,3.2.325,I say 'tis copper: darest thou be as good as thy word now?
2163,Henry IV,64,3.2.326,"Why, Hal, thou knowest, as thou art but man, I dare:"
2164,Henry IV,64,3.2.327,"but as thou art prince, I fear thee as I fear the"
2165,Henry IV,64,3.2.328,roaring of a lion's whelp.
2166,Henry IV,65,3.2.329,And why not as the lion?
2167,Henry IV,66,3.2.330,The king is to be feared as the lion: dost thou
2168,Henry IV,66,3.2.331,"think I'll fear thee as I fear thy father? nay, an"
2169,Henry IV,66,3.2.332,"I do, I pray God my girdle break."
2170,Henry IV,67,3.2.333,"O, if it should, how would thy guts fall about thy"
2171,Henry IV,67,3.2.334,"knees! But, sirrah, there's no room for faith,"
2172,Henry IV,67,3.2.335,"truth, nor honesty in this bosom of thine, it is all"
2173,Henry IV,67,3.2.336,filled up with guts and midriff. Charge an honest
2174,Henry IV,67,3.2.337,"woman with picking thy pocket! why, thou whoreson,"
2175,Henry IV,67,3.2.338,"impudent, embossed rascal, if there were anything in"
2176,Henry IV,67,3.2.339,"thy pocket but tavern-reckonings, memorandums of"
2177,Henry IV,67,3.2.340,"bawdy-houses, and one poor penny-worth of"
2178,Henry IV,67,3.2.341,"sugar-candy to make thee long-winded, if thy pocket"
2179,Henry IV,67,3.2.342,"were enriched with any other injuries but these, I"
2180,Henry IV,67,3.2.343,"am a villain: and yet you will stand to if, you will"
2181,Henry IV,67,3.2.344,not pocket up wrong: art thou not ashamed?
2182,Henry IV,68,3.2.345,"Dost thou hear, Hal? thou knowest in the state of"
2183,Henry IV,68,3.2.346,"innocency Adam fell, and what should poor Jack"
2184,Henry IV,68,3.2.347,Falstaff do in the days of villany? Thou seest I
2185,Henry IV,68,3.2.348,"have more flesh than another man, and therefore more"
2186,Henry IV,68,3.2.349,"frailty. You confess then, you picked my pocket?"
2187,Henry IV,69,3.2.350,It appears so by the story.
2188,Henry IV,70,3.2.351,"Hostess, I forgive thee: go, make ready breakfast,"
2189,Henry IV,70,3.2.352,"love thy husband, look to thy servants, cherish thy"
2190,Henry IV,70,3.2.353,guests: thou shalt find me tractable to any honest
2191,Henry IV,70,3.2.354,"reason: thou seest I am pacified still. Nay,"
2192,Henry IV,70,3.2.355,"prithee, be gone."
2193,Henry IV,70,,Exit Hostess
2194,Henry IV,70,3.2.356,"Now Hal, to the news at court: for the robbery,"
2195,Henry IV,70,3.2.357,"lad, how is that answered?"
2196,Henry IV,71,3.2.358,"O, my sweet beef, I must still be good angel to"
2197,Henry IV,71,3.2.359,thee: the money is paid back again.
2198,Henry IV,72,3.2.360,"O, I do not like that paying back, 'tis a double labour."
2199,Henry IV,73,3.2.361,I am good friends with my father and may do any thing.
2200,Henry IV,74,3.2.362,"Rob me the exchequer the first thing thou doest, and"
2201,Henry IV,74,3.2.363,do it with unwashed hands too.
2202,Henry IV,75,3.2.364,"Do, my lord."
2203,Henry IV,76,3.2.365,"I have procured thee, Jack, a charge of foot."
2204,Henry IV,77,3.2.366,I would it had been of horse. Where shall I find
2205,Henry IV,77,3.2.367,"one that can steal well? O for a fine thief, of the"
2206,Henry IV,77,3.2.368,age of two and twenty or thereabouts! I am
2207,Henry IV,77,3.2.369,"heinously unprovided. Well, God be thanked for"
2208,Henry IV,77,3.2.370,"these rebels, they offend none but the virtuous: I"
2209,Henry IV,77,3.2.371,"laud them, I praise them."
2210,Henry IV,78,3.2.372,Bardolph!
2211,Henry IV,79,3.2.373,My lord?
2212,Henry IV,80,3.2.374,"Go bear this letter to Lord John of Lancaster, to my"
2213,Henry IV,80,3.2.375,"brother John, this to my Lord of Westmoreland."
2214,Henry IV,80,,Exit Bardolph
2215,Henry IV,80,3.2.376,"Go, Peto, to horse, to horse, for thou and I have"
2216,Henry IV,80,3.2.377,thirty miles to ride yet ere dinner time.
2217,Henry IV,80,,Exit Peto
2218,Henry IV,80,3.2.378,"Jack, meet me to-morrow in the temple hall at two"

2220,Henry IV,80,3.2.380,"There shalt thou know thy charge, and there receive"
2221,Henry IV,80,3.2.381,Money and order for their furniture.
2222,Henry IV,80,3.2.382,"The land is burning, Percy stands on high,"
2223,Henry IV,80,3.2.383,And either we or they must lower lie.
2224,Henry IV,80,,Exit PRINCE HENRY
2225,Henry IV,81,3.2.384,"Rare words! brave world! Hostess, my breakfast, come!"
2226,Henry IV,81,3.2.385,"O, I could wish this tavern were my drum!"
2227,Henry IV,81,,Exit
2228,Henry IV,81,,ACT IV
2229,Henry IV,81,,SCENE I. The rebel camp near Shrewsbury.
2230,Henry IV,81,,"Enter HOTSPUR, WORCESTER, and DOUGLAS"
2231,Henry IV,1,4.1.1,"Well said, my noble Scot: if speaking truth"
2232,Henry IV,1,4.1.2,"In this fine age were not thought flattery,"
2233,Henry IV,1,4.1.3,"Such attribution should the Douglas have,"
2234,Henry IV,1,4.1.4,As not a soldier of this season's stamp
2235,Henry IV,1,4.1.5,Should go so general current through the world.
2236,Henry IV,1,4.1.6,"By God, I cannot flatter, I do defy"
2237,Henry IV,1,4.1.7,"The tongues of soothers, but a braver place"
2238,Henry IV,1,4.1.8,In my heart's love hath no man than yourself:
2239,Henry IV,1,4.1.9,"Nay, task me to my word, approve me, lord."
2240,Henry IV,2,4.1.10,Thou art the king of honour:
2241,Henry IV,2,4.1.11,No man so potent breathes upon the ground
2242,Henry IV,2,4.1.12,But I will beard him.
2243,Henry IV,3,4.1.13,"Do so, and 'tis well."
2244,Henry IV,3,,Enter a Messenger with letters
2245,Henry IV,3,4.1.14,What letters hast thou there?--I can but thank you.
2246,Henry IV,4,4.1.15,These letters come from your father.
2247,Henry IV,5,4.1.16,Letters from him! why comes he not himself?
2248,Henry IV,6,4.1.17,"He cannot come, my lord, he is grievous sick."
2249,Henry IV,7,4.1.18,'Zounds! how has he the leisure to be sick
2250,Henry IV,7,4.1.19,In such a rustling time? Who leads his power?
2251,Henry IV,7,4.1.20,Under whose government come they along?
2252,Henry IV,8,4.1.21,"His letters bear his mind, not I, my lord."
2253,Henry IV,9,4.1.22,"I prithee, tell me, doth he keep his bed?"
2254,Henry IV,10,4.1.23,"He did, my lord, four days ere I set forth,"
2255,Henry IV,10,4.1.24,And at the time of my departure thence
2256,Henry IV,10,4.1.25,He was much fear'd by his physicians.
2257,Henry IV,11,4.1.26,I would the state of time had first been whole
2258,Henry IV,11,4.1.27,Ere he by sickness had been visited:
2259,Henry IV,11,4.1.28,His health was never better worth than now.
2260,Henry IV,12,4.1.29,Sick now! droop now! this sickness doth infect
2261,Henry IV,12,4.1.30,"The very life-blood of our enterprise,"
2262,Henry IV,12,4.1.31,"'Tis catching hither, even to our camp."
2263,Henry IV,12,4.1.32,"He writes me here, that inward sickness--"
2264,Henry IV,12,4.1.33,And that his friends by deputation could not
2265,Henry IV,12,4.1.34,"So soon be drawn, nor did he think it meet"
2266,Henry IV,12,4.1.35,To lay so dangerous and dear a trust
2267,Henry IV,12,4.1.36,On any soul removed but on his own.
2268,Henry IV,12,4.1.37,"Yet doth he give us bold advertisement,"
2269,Henry IV,12,4.1.38,"That with our small conjunction we should on,"
2270,Henry IV,12,4.1.39,"To see how fortune is disposed to us,"
2271,Henry IV,12,4.1.40,"For, as he writes, there is no quailing now."
2272,Henry IV,12,4.1.41,Because the king is certainly possess'd
2273,Henry IV,12,4.1.42,Of all our purposes. What say you to it?
2274,Henry IV,13,4.1.43,Your father's sickness is a maim to us.
2275,Henry IV,14,4.1.44,"A perilous gash, a very limb lopp'd off:"
2276,Henry IV,14,4.1.45,"And yet, in faith, it is not, his present want"
2277,Henry IV,14,4.1.46,Seems more than we shall find it: were it good
2278,Henry IV,14,4.1.47,To set the exact wealth of all our states
2279,Henry IV,14,4.1.48,All at one cast? to set so rich a main
2280,Henry IV,14,4.1.49,On the nice hazard of one doubtful hour?
2281,Henry IV,14,4.1.50,"It were not good, for therein should we read"
2282,Henry IV,14,4.1.51,"The very bottom and the soul of hope,"
2283,Henry IV,14,4.1.52,"The very list, the very utmost bound"
2284,Henry IV,14,4.1.53,Of all our fortunes.
2285,Henry IV,15,4.1.54,"'Faith, and so we should,"
2286,Henry IV,15,4.1.55,Where now remains a sweet reversion:
2287,Henry IV,15,4.1.56,We may boldly spend upon the hope of what
2288,Henry IV,15,4.1.57,Is to come in:
2289,Henry IV,15,4.1.58,A comfort of retirement lives in this.
2290,Henry IV,16,4.1.59,"A rendezvous, a home to fly unto."
2291,Henry IV,16,4.1.60,If that the devil and mischance look big
2292,Henry IV,16,4.1.61,Upon the maidenhead of our affairs.
2293,Henry IV,17,4.1.62,But yet I would your father had been here.
2294,Henry IV,17,4.1.63,The quality and hair of our attempt
2295,Henry IV,17,4.1.64,Brooks no division: it will be thought
2296,Henry IV,17,4.1.65,"By some, that know not why he is away,"
2297,Henry IV,17,4.1.66,"That wisdom, loyalty and mere dislike"
2298,Henry IV,17,4.1.67,Of our proceedings kept the earl from hence:
2299,Henry IV,17,4.1.68,And think how such an apprehension
2300,Henry IV,17,4.1.69,May turn the tide of fearful faction
2301,Henry IV,17,4.1.70,"And breed a kind of question in our cause,"
2302,Henry IV,17,4.1.71,For well you know we of the offering side
2303,Henry IV,17,4.1.72,"Must keep aloof from strict arbitrement,"
2304,Henry IV,17,4.1.73,"And stop all sight-holes, every loop from whence"
2305,Henry IV,17,4.1.74,The eye of reason may pry in upon us:
2306,Henry IV,17,4.1.75,"This absence of your father's draws a curtain,"
2307,Henry IV,17,4.1.76,That shows the ignorant a kind of fear
2308,Henry IV,17,4.1.77,Before not dreamt of.
2309,Henry IV,18,4.1.78,You strain too far.
2310,Henry IV,18,4.1.79,I rather of his absence make this use:
2311,Henry IV,18,4.1.80,"It lends a lustre and more great opinion,"
2312,Henry IV,18,4.1.81,"A larger dare to our great enterprise,"
2313,Henry IV,18,4.1.82,"Than if the earl were here, for men must think,"
2314,Henry IV,18,4.1.83,If we without his help can make a head
2315,Henry IV,18,4.1.84,"To push against a kingdom, with his help"
2316,Henry IV,18,4.1.85,We shall o'erturn it topsy-turvy down.
2317,Henry IV,18,4.1.86,"Yet all goes well, yet all our joints are whole."
2318,Henry IV,19,4.1.87,As heart can think: there is not such a word
2319,Henry IV,19,4.1.88,Spoke of in Scotland as this term of fear.
2320,Henry IV,19,,Enter SIR RICHARD VERNON
2321,Henry IV,20,4.1.89,"My cousin Vernon, welcome, by my soul."
2322,Henry IV,21,4.1.90,"Pray God my news be worth a welcome, lord."
2323,Henry IV,21,4.1.91,"The Earl of Westmoreland, seven thousand strong,"
2324,Henry IV,21,4.1.92,"Is marching hitherwards, with him Prince John."
2325,Henry IV,22,4.1.93,No harm: what more?
2326,Henry IV,23,4.1.94,"And further, I have learn'd,"
2327,Henry IV,23,4.1.95,"The king himself in person is set forth,"
2328,Henry IV,23,4.1.96,"Or hitherwards intended speedily,"
2329,Henry IV,23,4.1.97,With strong and mighty preparation.
2330,Henry IV,24,4.1.98,"He shall be welcome too. Where is his son,"
2331,Henry IV,24,4.1.99,"The nimble-footed madcap Prince of Wales,"
2332,Henry IV,24,4.1.100,"And his comrades, that daff'd the world aside,"
2333,Henry IV,24,4.1.101,And bid it pass?
2334,Henry IV,25,4.1.102,"All furnish'd, all in arms,"
2335,Henry IV,25,4.1.103,All plumed like estridges that with the wind
2336,Henry IV,25,4.1.104,"Baited like eagles having lately bathed,"
2337,Henry IV,25,4.1.105,"Glittering in golden coats, like images,"
2338,Henry IV,25,4.1.106,"As full of spirit as the month of May,"
2339,Henry IV,25,4.1.107,"And gorgeous as the sun at midsummer,"
2340,Henry IV,25,4.1.108,"Wanton as youthful goats, wild as young bulls."
2341,Henry IV,25,4.1.109,"I saw young Harry, with his beaver on,"
2342,Henry IV,25,4.1.110,"His cuisses on his thighs, gallantly arm'd"
2343,Henry IV,25,4.1.111,"Rise from the ground like feather'd Mercury,"
2344,Henry IV,25,4.1.112,"And vaulted with such ease into his seat,"
2345,Henry IV,25,4.1.113,"As if an angel dropp'd down from the clouds,"
2346,Henry IV,25,4.1.114,To turn and wind a fiery Pegasus
2347,Henry IV,25,4.1.115,And witch the world with noble horsemanship.
2348,Henry IV,26,4.1.116,"No more, no more: worse than the sun in March,"
2349,Henry IV,26,4.1.117,This praise doth nourish agues. Let them come:
2350,Henry IV,26,4.1.118,"They come like sacrifices in their trim,"
2351,Henry IV,26,4.1.119,And to the fire-eyed maid of smoky war
2352,Henry IV,26,4.1.120,All hot and bleeding will we offer them:
2353,Henry IV,26,4.1.121,The mailed Mars shall on his altar sit
2354,Henry IV,26,4.1.122,Up to the ears in blood. I am on fire
2355,Henry IV,26,4.1.123,To hear this rich reprisal is so nigh
2356,Henry IV,26,4.1.124,"And yet not ours. Come, let me taste my horse,"
2357,Henry IV,26,4.1.125,Who is to bear me like a thunderbolt
2358,Henry IV,26,4.1.126,Against the bosom of the Prince of Wales:
2359,Henry IV,26,4.1.127,"Harry to Harry shall, hot horse to horse,"
2360,Henry IV,26,4.1.128,Meet and ne'er part till one drop down a corse.
2361,Henry IV,26,4.1.129,O that Glendower were come!
2362,Henry IV,27,4.1.130,There is more news:
2363,Henry IV,27,4.1.131,"I learn'd in Worcester, as I rode along,"
2364,Henry IV,27,4.1.132,He cannot draw his power this fourteen days.
2365,Henry IV,28,4.1.133,That's the worst tidings that I hear of yet.
2366,Henry IV,29,4.1.134,"Ay, by my faith, that bears a frosty sound."
2367,Henry IV,30,4.1.135,What may the king's whole battle reach unto?
2368,Henry IV,31,4.1.136,To thirty thousand.
2369,Henry IV,32,4.1.137,Forty let it be:
2370,Henry IV,32,4.1.138,"My father and Glendower being both away,"
2371,Henry IV,32,4.1.139,The powers of us may serve so great a day
2372,Henry IV,32,4.1.140,"Come, let us take a muster speedily:"
2373,Henry IV,32,4.1.141,"Doomsday is near, die all, die merrily."
2374,Henry IV,33,4.1.142,Talk not of dying: I am out of fear
2375,Henry IV,33,4.1.143,Of death or death's hand for this one-half year.
2376,Henry IV,33,,Exeunt
2377,Henry IV,33,,SCENE II. A public road near Coventry.
2378,Henry IV,33,,Enter FALSTAFF and BARDOLPH
2379,Henry IV,1,4.2.1,"Bardolph, get thee before to Coventry, fill me a"
2380,Henry IV,1,4.2.2,"bottle of sack: our soldiers shall march through,"
2381,Henry IV,1,4.2.3,we'll to Sutton Co'fil' tonight.
2382,Henry IV,2,4.2.4,"Will you give me money, captain?"
2383,Henry IV,3,4.2.5,"Lay out, lay out."
2384,Henry IV,4,4.2.6,This bottle makes an angel.
2385,Henry IV,5,4.2.7,"An if it do, take it for thy labour, and if it make"
2386,Henry IV,5,4.2.8,"twenty, take them all, I'll answer the coinage. Bid"
2387,Henry IV,5,4.2.9,my lieutenant Peto meet me at town's end.
2388,Henry IV,6,4.2.10,"I will, captain: farewell."
2389,Henry IV,6,,Exit
2390,Henry IV,7,4.2.11,"If I be not ashamed of my soldiers, I am a soused"
2391,Henry IV,7,4.2.12,gurnet. I have misused the king's press damnably.
2392,Henry IV,7,4.2.13,"I have got, in exchange of a hundred and fifty"
2393,Henry IV,7,4.2.14,"soldiers, three hundred and odd pounds. I press me"
2394,Henry IV,7,4.2.15,"none but good house-holders, yeoman's sons, inquire"
2395,Henry IV,7,4.2.16,"me out contracted bachelors, such as had been asked"
2396,Henry IV,7,4.2.17,"twice on the banns, such a commodity of warm slaves,"
2397,Henry IV,7,4.2.18,"as had as lieve hear the devil as a drum, such as"
2398,Henry IV,7,4.2.19,fear the report of a caliver worse than a struck
2399,Henry IV,7,4.2.20,fowl or a hurt wild-duck. I pressed me none but such
2400,Henry IV,7,4.2.21,"toasts-and-butter, with hearts in their bellies no"
2401,Henry IV,7,4.2.22,"bigger than pins' heads, and they have bought out"
2402,Henry IV,7,4.2.23,"their services, and now my whole charge consists of"
2403,Henry IV,7,4.2.24,"ancients, corporals, lieutenants, gentlemen of"
2404,Henry IV,7,4.2.25,"companies, slaves as ragged as Lazarus in the"
2405,Henry IV,7,4.2.26,"painted cloth, where the glutton's dogs licked his"
2406,Henry IV,7,4.2.27,"sores, and such as indeed were never soldiers, but"
2407,Henry IV,7,4.2.28,"discarded unjust serving-men, younger sons to"
2408,Henry IV,7,4.2.29,"younger brothers, revolted tapsters and ostlers"
2409,Henry IV,7,4.2.30,"trade-fallen, the cankers of a calm world and a"
2410,Henry IV,7,4.2.31,"long peace, ten times more dishonourable ragged than"
2411,Henry IV,7,4.2.32,"an old faced ancient: and such have I, to fill up"
2412,Henry IV,7,4.2.33,the rooms of them that have bought out their
2413,Henry IV,7,4.2.34,"services, that you would think that I had a hundred"
2414,Henry IV,7,4.2.35,and fifty tattered prodigals lately come from
2415,Henry IV,7,4.2.36,"swine-keeping, from eating draff and husks. A mad"
2416,Henry IV,7,4.2.37,fellow met me on the way and told me I had unloaded
2417,Henry IV,7,4.2.38,all the gibbets and pressed the dead bodies. No eye
2418,Henry IV,7,4.2.39,hath seen such scarecrows. I'll not march through
2419,Henry IV,7,4.2.40,"Coventry with them, that's flat: nay, and the"
2420,Henry IV,7,4.2.41,"villains march wide betwixt the legs, as if they had"
2421,Henry IV,7,4.2.42,"gyves on, for indeed I had the most of them out of"
2422,Henry IV,7,4.2.43,prison. There's but a shirt and a half in all my
2423,Henry IV,7,4.2.44,"company, and the half shirt is two napkins tacked"
2424,Henry IV,7,4.2.45,together and thrown over the shoulders like an
2425,Henry IV,7,4.2.46,"herald's coat without sleeves, and the shirt, to say"
2426,Henry IV,7,4.2.47,"the truth, stolen from my host at Saint Alban's, or"
2427,Henry IV,7,4.2.48,the red-nose innkeeper of Daventry. But that's all
2428,Henry IV,7,4.2.49,"one, they'll find linen enough on every hedge."
2429,Henry IV,7,,Enter the PRINCE and WESTMORELAND
2430,Henry IV,8,4.2.50,"How now, blown Jack! how now, quilt!"
2431,Henry IV,9,4.2.51,"What, Hal! how now, mad wag! what a devil dost thou"
2432,Henry IV,9,4.2.52,"in Warwickshire? My good Lord of Westmoreland, I"
2433,Henry IV,9,4.2.53,cry you mercy: I thought your honour had already been
2434,Henry IV,9,4.2.54,at Shrewsbury.
2435,Henry IV,10,4.2.55,"Faith, Sir John,'tis more than time that I were"
2436,Henry IV,10,4.2.56,"there, and you too, but my powers are there already."
2437,Henry IV,10,4.2.57,"The king, I can tell you, looks for us all: we must"
2438,Henry IV,10,4.2.58,away all night.
2439,Henry IV,11,4.2.59,"Tut, never fear me: I am as vigilant as a cat to"
2440,Henry IV,11,4.2.60,steal cream.
2441,Henry IV,12,4.2.61,"I think, to steal cream indeed, for thy theft hath"
2442,Henry IV,12,4.2.62,"already made thee butter. But tell me, Jack, whose"
2443,Henry IV,12,4.2.63,fellows are these that come after?
2444,Henry IV,13,4.2.64,"Mine, Hal, mine."
2445,Henry IV,14,4.2.65,I did never see such pitiful rascals.
2446,Henry IV,15,4.2.66,"Tut, tut, good enough to toss, food for powder, food"
2447,Henry IV,15,4.2.67,"for powder, they'll fill a pit as well as better:"
2448,Henry IV,15,4.2.68,"tush, man, mortal men, mortal men."
2449,Henry IV,16,4.2.69,"Ay, but, Sir John, methinks they are exceeding poor"
2450,Henry IV,16,4.2.70,"and bare, too beggarly."
2451,Henry IV,17,4.2.71,"'Faith, for their poverty, I know not where they had"
2452,Henry IV,17,4.2.72,"that, and for their bareness, I am sure they never"
2453,Henry IV,17,4.2.73,learned that of me.
2454,Henry IV,18,4.2.74,"No I'll be sworn, unless you call three fingers on"
2455,Henry IV,18,4.2.75,"the ribs bare. But, sirrah, make haste: Percy is"
2456,Henry IV,18,4.2.76,already in the field.
2457,Henry IV,19,4.2.77,"What, is the king encamped?"
2458,Henry IV,20,4.2.78,"He is, Sir John: I fear we shall stay too long."
2459,Henry IV,21,4.2.79,"Well,"
2460,Henry IV,21,4.2.80,To the latter end of a fray and the beginning of a feast
2461,Henry IV,21,4.2.81,Fits a dull fighter and a keen guest.
2462,Henry IV,21,,Exeunt
2463,Henry IV,21,,SCENE III. The rebel camp near Shrewsbury.
2464,Henry IV,21,,"Enter HOTSPUR, WORCESTER, DOUGLAS, and VERNON"
2465,Henry IV,1,4.3.1,We'll fight with him to-night.
2466,Henry IV,2,4.3.2,It may not be.
2467,Henry IV,3,4.3.3,You give him then the advantage.
2468,Henry IV,4,4.3.4,Not a whit.
2469,Henry IV,5,4.3.5,Why say you so? looks he not for supply?
2470,Henry IV,6,4.3.6,So do we.
2471,Henry IV,7,4.3.7,"His is certain, ours is doubtful."
2472,Henry IV,8,4.3.8,"Good cousin, be advised, stir not tonight."
2473,Henry IV,9,4.3.9,"Do not, my lord."
2474,Henry IV,10,4.3.10,You do not counsel well:
2475,Henry IV,10,4.3.11,You speak it out of fear and cold heart.
2476,Henry IV,11,4.3.12,"Do me no slander, Douglas: by my life,"
2477,Henry IV,11,4.3.13,"And I dare well maintain it with my life,"
2478,Henry IV,11,4.3.14,"If well-respected honour bid me on,"
2479,Henry IV,11,4.3.15,I hold as little counsel with weak fear
2480,Henry IV,11,4.3.16,"As you, my lord, or any Scot that this day lives:"
2481,Henry IV,11,4.3.17,Let it be seen to-morrow in the battle
2482,Henry IV,11,4.3.18,Which of us fears.
2483,Henry IV,12,4.3.19,"Yea, or to-night."
2484,Henry IV,13,4.3.20,Content.
2485,Henry IV,14,4.3.21,"To-night, say I."
2486,Henry IV,15,4.3.22,"Come, come it nay not be. I wonder much,"
2487,Henry IV,15,4.3.23,"Being men of such great leading as you are,"
2488,Henry IV,15,4.3.24,That you foresee not what impediments
2489,Henry IV,15,4.3.25,Drag back our expedition: certain horse
2490,Henry IV,15,4.3.26,Of my cousin Vernon's are not yet come up:
2491,Henry IV,15,4.3.27,"Your uncle Worcester's horse came but today,"
2492,Henry IV,15,4.3.28,"And now their pride and mettle is asleep,"
2493,Henry IV,15,4.3.29,"Their courage with hard labour tame and dull,"
2494,Henry IV,15,4.3.30,That not a horse is half the half of himself.
2495,Henry IV,16,4.3.31,So are the horses of the enemy
2496,Henry IV,16,4.3.32,"In general, journey-bated and brought low:"
2497,Henry IV,16,4.3.33,The better part of ours are full of rest.
2498,Henry IV,17,4.3.34,The number of the king exceedeth ours:
2499,Henry IV,17,4.3.35,"For God's sake. cousin, stay till all come in."
